He now spent forty days and nights in the work of intercession. We are not to understand that the first forty were so spent. At that time he received the pattern of the tabernacle and the directions for the priesthood, which he did not deliver to Israel until after he descended from Sinai the second time. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18-18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-1.htm" title="And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, These are the words which the LORD has commanded, that you should do them.">Exodus 35:1</a>. &c.) During the first forty days, Joshua was with Moses in the mount (probably to help in taking the pattern for the tabernacle); during the second forty Moses was alone.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - Moses interceded with God for the people before he came down from the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>, etc.); but this he passes over here, merely referring to it in the words, "as at the first," and makes special mention only of a subsequent intercession, that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>. In the account in Exodus nothing is said of Moses interceding for Aaron specially, as well as for the people generally; but prominence is given to this here, "not only that he might make the people thoroughly aware that at that time Israel could not boast even of the righteousness of its eminent men (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-27.htm">Isaiah 43:27</a>), but also to bring out the fact, which is described still more fully in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>., that Aaron's investiture with the priesthood and the maintenance of this institution was purely a work of Divine grace" (Keil). That Aaron, however, was regarded as especially to be blamed in this matter is clearly intimated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-21.htm">Exodus 32:21, 22</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:7-29 That the Israelites might have no pretence to think that God brought them to Canaan for their righteousness, Moses shows what a miracle of mercy it was, that they had not been destroyed in the wilderness. It is good for us often to remember against ourselves, with sorrow and shame, our former sins; that we may see how much we are indebted to free grace, and may humbly own that we never merited any thing but wrath and the curse at God's hand. For so strong is our propensity to pride, that it will creep in under one pretence or another. We are ready to fancy that our righteousness has got for us the special favour of the Lord, though in reality our wickedness is more plain than our weakness. But when the secret history of every man's life shall be brought forth at the day of judgment, all the world will be proved guilty before God. At present, One pleads for us before the mercy-seat, who not only fasted, but died upon the cross for our sins; through whom we may approach, though self-condemned sinners, and beseech for undeserved mercy and for eternal life, as the gift of God in Him. Let us refer all the victory, all the glory, and all the praise, to Him who alone bringeth salvation.</body></html>
