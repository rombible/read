The expression corresponds to ver. 1, "Thou art to pass... and thou knowest." In the victory they had obtained over Sihon and Og, they had already had experience of the Lord's going before them, and leading them on in triumph. The repetition of the <span class="cmt_word">He</span> in this verse is very emphatic. <span class="cmt_word">Consuming fire</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Quickly</span>, or <span class="accented">suddenly</span>. There is no contradiction here of what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; for there the reference is to the possession of the land by Israel, here it is to the destruction which was to come on the Canaanites - the former was to be by degrees, the latter was to come suddenly and overwhelmingly. <span class="cmt_word">As Jehovah hath said unto thee</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23, 27</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 Moses represents the strength of the enemies they were now to encounter. This was to drive them to God, and engage their hope in him. He assures them of victory, by the presence of God with them. He cautions them not to have the least thought of their own righteousness, as if that procured this favour at God's hand. In Christ we have both righteousness and strength; in Him we must glory, not in ourselves, nor in any sufficiency of our own. It is for the wickedness of these nations that God drives them out. All whom God rejects, are rejected for their own wickedness; but none whom he accepts are accepted for their own righteousness. Thus boasting is for ever done away: see Eph 2:9,11,12.</body></html>
