(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13-14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Cities . . . fenced up to heaven.</span>--Comp. the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm" title="And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.">Genesis 11:4</a>, "a city and a tower whose top may reach unto (literally, <span class= "ital">is in</span>) heaven." So here, "cities great and fortified <span class= "ital">in the heavens." </span>Was St. Paul thinking of this expression when he said, "We wrestle against spiritual wickedness <span class= "ital">in the heavenly regions?" </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This day</span>; at this time, very soon. <span class="cmt_word">Nations</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Cities</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 Moses represents the strength of the enemies they were now to encounter. This was to drive them to God, and engage their hope in him. He assures them of victory, by the presence of God with them. He cautions them not to have the least thought of their own righteousness, as if that procured this favour at God's hand. In Christ we have both righteousness and strength; in Him we must glory, not in ourselves, nor in any sufficiency of our own. It is for the wickedness of these nations that God drives them out. All whom God rejects, are rejected for their own wickedness; but none whom he accepts are accepted for their own righteousness. Thus boasting is for ever done away: see Eph 2:9,11,12.</body></html>
