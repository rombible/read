It is remarkable that all His answers to the tempter were taken not only from Deuteronomy, <span class= "ital">but from one and the same portion of Deuteronomy</span>--Deuteronomy 5-10 inclusive--the portion which applies the principles of the Decalogue to Israel's life.<p><span class= "bld">And shalt swear by his name.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-13.htm" title="And in all things that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.">Exodus 23:13</a>. "Make no mention of the name of other gods." The principle was not unknown to the patriarchs. Laban appealed to the "God of Nahor," but "Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-53.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.">Genesis 31:53</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm" title="How shall I pardon you for this? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.">Jeremiah 5:7</a> : "Thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by . . . no-gods.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God.</span> The fear of the Lord - that reverent awe which is akin to love - is the beginning of wisdom and the foundation of piety; where it is in the heart it will lead to serving of the Lord in holy obedience; and they in whom it dwells will swear by his Name, recognizing his presence and omniscience, and not daring to asseverate anything but what they know to be true. Thus, really believing in God and reverently worshipping him, the Israelites would be careful not to go after other gods, or to give to any object that homage which is due unto Jehovah alone, knowing that this he will not endure or suffer with impunity; for he is a jealous God, and them that thus dishonor him he will destroy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, etc.). Thus also they should be kept from murmuring against God, and thereby tempting him - putting him, as it were, to the proof, and calling in question his presence and his power, as they had done at Massah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>). Without this genuine religious principle there will be no sincere worship, no true reverence, no real obedience, rendered unto God. But where this dwells in the heart it will influence the whole life, so that the commandments of God shall be diligently kept, and that which is good and right in his sight shall be done. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-16 Here are means for maintaining and keeping up religion in our hearts and houses. 1. Meditation. God's words must be laid up in our hearts, that our thoughts may be daily employed about them. 2. The religious education of children. Often repeat these things to them. Be careful and exact in teaching thy children. Teach these truths to all who are any way under thy care. 3. Pious discourse. Thou shalt talk of these things with due reverence and seriousness, for the benefit not only of thy children, but of thy servants, thy friends and companions. Take all occasions to discourse with those about thee, not of matters of doubtful disputation, but of the plain truths and laws of God, and the things that belong to our peace. 4. Frequent reading of the word. God appointed them to write sentences of the law upon their walls, and in scrolls of parchment to be worn about their wrists. This seems to have been binding in the letter of it to the Jews, as it is to us in the intent of it; which is, that we should by all means make the word of God familiar to us; that we may have it ready to use upon all occasions, to restrain us from sin, and direct us in duty. We must never be ashamed to own our religion, nor to own ourselves under its check and government. Here is a caution not to forget God in a day of prosperity and plenty. When they came easily by the gift, they would be apt to grow secure, and unmindful of the Giver. Therefore be careful, when thou liest safe and soft, lest thou forget the Lord. When the world smiles, we are apt to make court to it, and expect our happiness in it, and so we forget Him who is our only portion and rest. There is need of great care and caution at such a time. Then beware; being warned of your danger, stand upon your guard. Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God; neither by despairing of his power and goodness, while we keep in the way of our duty; nor by presuming upon it, when we turn aside out of that way.</body></html>
