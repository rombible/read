Hence, perhaps, the <span class= "ital">four </span>terms, "<span class= "ital">heart, mind, soul, </span>and <span class= "ital">strength," </span>which we find in St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-30.htm" title="And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength: this is the first commandment.">Mark 12:30</a>. Bashi says upon the expression "all thy heart"--"with both natures" (the good and evil nature). "With all thy soul" he expounds thus: "Even though He take it (thy life) from thee." And "with all thy might" he paraphrases in a truly practical and characteristic fashion, "<span class= "ital">With all thy money, </span>for you sometimes find a man whose money is dearer to him than his life (or body)." Or, as an alternative, "in every condition which He allots to thee, whether prosperity or chastisement. And so He says in David, 'I will <span class= "ital">take the cup of salvation </span>(deliverances), and <span class= "ital">I will call on the name of the Lord' </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-13.htm" title="I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the LORD.">Psalm 116:13</a>); and again.

It is an interesting illustration of the passage, though the <span class= "ital">verbal </span>connection on which it is based will not hold.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - To the one indivisible Jehovah undivided devotion and love are due. Hence the injunction, <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</span> The "heart" is the inner nature of the man, including his intellectual, emotional, and cognitive futurities; the "soul" is the personality, the entire self-consciousness; and the" might" is the sum of the energies, bodily and mental. Not by profession merely is Jehovah to be loved; the whole man, body, soul, and spirit, is to be yielded to him in holy and devout affection (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The last letter Of the first word, and the last letter of the last word in this verse are larger than the ordinary size (<span class="accented">majuscula</span>), and as these two form the word for witness (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span>), the Jews say that they are written thus "that every one may know, when he professes the unity of God, that his heart ought to be intent and devoid of every other thought, because God is a <span class="accented">witness</span>, and knoweth everything" (R. Bechai, fol. 195, quoted by Michaelis, 'Bib. Heb,' in loc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:4,5 Here is a brief summary of religion, containing the first principles of faith and obedience. Jehovah our God is the only living and true God; he only is God, and he is but One God. Let us not desire to have any other. The three-fold mention of the Divine names, and the plural number of the word translated God, seem plainly to intimate a Trinity of persons, even in this express declaration of the unity of the Godhead. Happy those who have this one Lord for their God. It is better to have one fountain than a thousand cisterns; one all-sufficient God than a thousand insufficient friends. This is the first and great commandment of God's law, that we love him; and that we do all parts of our duty to him from a principle of love; My son, give me thine heart. We are to love God with all our heart, and soul, and might. That is, 1. With a sincere love; not in word and tongue only, but inwardly in truth. 2. With a strong love. He that is our All, must have our all, and none but he. 3. With a superlative love; we must love God above any creature whatever, and love nothing but what we love for him. 4. With an intelligent love. To love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, we must see good cause to love him. 5. With an entire love; he is ONE, our hearts must be united in his love. Oh that this love of God may be shed abroad in our hearts!</body></html>
