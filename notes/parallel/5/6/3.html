<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>). But the fulfillment of this promise was conditioned by their continuing as a people in the fear of God, and in obedience to his Law. Everything, then, depended on their hearing what Moses had been commanded to teach them, and observing to do it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">In the land</span>, etc. This is to be connected with the clause, "that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily;" the land was to be the scene and sphere of their prosperity and increase.

There is, indeed, no preposition before "the land" in the Hebrew; but nothing is more common in that language than for the accusative of a noun to be used adverbially to describe the place where anything is done. <span class="cmt_word">Milk and honey</span>; emblem of fruitfulness and sweetness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>); proverbially descriptive of Canaan, as rich in pasturage for flocks, and abounding in flowers whence the bees could extract honey (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8, 17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-3 In this and the like passages, the commandments seem to denote the moral law, the statues the ceremonial law, and the judgments the law by which the judges decided. Moses taught the people all that, and that only, which God commanded him to teach. Thus Christ's ministers are to teach his churches all he has commanded, neither more nor less, Mt 28:20. The fear of God in the heart will be the most powerful principle of obedience. It is highly desirable that not we only, but our children, and our children's children, may fear the Lord. Religion and righteousness advance and secure the prosperity of any people.</body></html>
