The first part of the application is more general, and concerns <span class= "ital">the relation of Israel to Jehovah, </span>who has brought them from Egypt through the wilderness to the promised land. This portion concludes with Deuteronomy 11. The precepts that follow are particular, and concern the <span class= "ital">land of Israel </span>viewed as the seat of (1) the <span class= "ital">worship </span>and (2) the <span class= "ital">kingdom </span>of Jehovah. But the whole discourse, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44</a> to the end of Deuteronomy 26 is presented to us as one unbroken whole. (See Introduction for a complete analysis.)<p><span class= "bld">The commandments.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">this is the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments. </span>The "commandment" is the <span class= "ital">duty </span>imposed on Israel by the covenant of the ten words--its application to their daily lives. This application includes (1) statutes, religious ordinances, or institutions; and (2) judgments, requirements, actual rules of behaviour. The two words "statutes" and "judgments," in the original, may sometimes represent two aspects of the same thing. For example, the Passover is an ordinance, or "statute," or, as we should say, an "institution." The rules for its observance are "judgments," or requirements. The thing itself is permanent; the rules for its observance may vary. It was originally eaten standing, and in haste. But after Israel was at rest, it was eaten by them reclining, and in an attitude of repose. Again, the moral law as a whole was eternal; but its application to the life of Israel was very different from its application to ourselves. The word here rendered "commandments" is now commonly employed by the Jews to signify any religious duty or good work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - Some connect this with what goes before, and take it as a sort of epilogue to the preceding discourse; but it is rather to be regarded as introductory to what follows. Being about to enjoin upon the people the commandments they were to obey in the land on which they were about to enter, Moses prefaces this with a general announcement of what he was about to deliver, and with a statement of the reason for such deliverance, and of the benefits that would flow from the observance of what should be enjoined. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the commandments.</span> In the Hebrew it is, <span class="accented">This is the commandment</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sum and substance of the Divine enactment; equivalent to "the Law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-44.htm">Deuteronomy 4:44</a>). "The statutes and judgments" (rights) are in apposition to "the commandment," and explain it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-3 In this and the like passages, the commandments seem to denote the moral law, the statues the ceremonial law, and the judgments the law by which the judges decided. Moses taught the people all that, and that only, which God commanded him to teach. Thus Christ's ministers are to teach his churches all he has commanded, neither more nor less, Mt 28:20. The fear of God in the heart will be the most powerful principle of obedience. It is highly desirable that not we only, but our children, and our children's children, may fear the Lord. Religion and righteousness advance and secure the prosperity of any people.</body></html>
