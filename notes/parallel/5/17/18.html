The English conveys the right sense of the word, which primarily denotes repetition. In Hebrew it is <span class= "ital">Mishneh, </span>the name afterwards given to the "text" of the Talmud, of which the idea is to repeat the law; though it is a somewhat peculiar repetition, in which <span class= "ital">minuti? </span>are chiefly dealt with, and weightier matters left out.<p>There are traces of this direction (1) in the coronation of Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-11.htm" title="Then they brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king.

And Shaphan read it before the king.">2Chronicles 34:18</a>), and in the effect of the perusal of it upon that king. But it is singular that we do not hear of the Book of the Law in connection with David and Solomon. Possibly, as David was a prophet himself, and not only a king, it may be thought unnecessary to make special mention of his study of the law. In many things he acted upon the direct commands of God to himself or to his seers.<p>We must not forget that the true king of Israel is He whose special mission it was "to fulfil the law and the prophets." "Lo, I come, <span class= "ital">in the volume of the book it is written of </span>me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: <span class= "ital">yea, thy law is within my heart."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A copy of this law</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a double of this Law</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not, as the LXX. have it, "This reiteration of the Law" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), but a duplicate or copy of the Pentateuchal Law. The Jews understand by "double" that <span class="accented">two</span> copies of the Law were to be made by the king (Maimon., ' De Regibus,' e. 3. &sect; 1); but this is unnecessary: every copy of a law is a double of it. Oat of that which is <span class="cmt_word">before the priests</span>. The priests were the custodians of the written Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>); and from the text of their codex was the king's copy to be written. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:14-20 God himself was in a particular manner Israel's King; and if they set another over them, it was necessary that he should choose the person. Accordingly, when the people desired a king, they applied to Samuel, a prophet of the Lord. In all cases, God's choice, if we can but know it, should direct, determine, and overrule ours. Laws are given for the prince that should be elected. He must carefully avoid every thing that would turn him from God and religion. Riches, honours, and pleasures, are three great hinderances of godliness, (the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life,) especially to those in high stations; against these the king is here warned. The king must carefully study the law of God, and make that his rule; and having a copy of the Scriptures of his own writing, must read therein all the days of his life. It is not enough to have Bibles, but we must use them, use them daily, as long as we live. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bibles, but will have constant occasion for them, till they come to that world where knowledge and love will be made perfect. The king's writing and reading were as nothing, if he did not practise what he wrote and read.
