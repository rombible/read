The penalty there is directed against the teachers of idolatry, whether prophets, private individuals, or communities in Israel. Here the penalty of death is enacted for every individual, man or woman, found guilty of worshipping any other god but Jehovah. We find traces of this law in the covenant made in the reign of Asa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-13.htm" title="That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.">2Chronicles 15:13</a>), "that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, <span class= "ital">whether man or woman.</span><p>(3) <span class= "bld">Either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven.</span>--The oldest and simplest, and apparently most innocent form of idolatry. If this was punishable with death, obviously no grosser form of idolatry could be spared. The Book of Job, which knows no other idolatry, admits this to be a denial "of the God that is above" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/31-26.htm" title="If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;">Job 31:26-28</a>).<p>(6) <span class= "bld">He that is worthy of death.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">he that dieth.</span><p>(7) <span class= "bld">The hands of the witnesses . . . first.</span>--A great safeguard against false testimony.<p><span class= "bld">Put . . . away.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">consume. </span>The primary meaning of the word is "burn." <span class= "ital">Taberah, </span>"burning," is a derivative.<p><span class= "bld">The evil.</span>--The Greek version renders this "the wicked man," and the sentence is taken up in this form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="But them that are without God judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.">1Corinthians 5:13</a>, "and ye shall put away from among you <span class= "ital">that wicked person." </span>The phrase is of frequent occurrence in Deuteronomy, and if we are to understand that in all places where it occurs "the evil" is to be under. stood of an individual, and to be taken in the masculine gender, the fact seems to deserve notice in considering the phrase "deliver us from evil" in the Lord's Prayer. There is really no such thing as wickedness in the world apart from some wicked being or person. We are also reminded of the famous argument of St. Augustine, that evil has no existence except as a corruption of good, or a creature's perverted will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>, Moses enacts what is to be done to those who seduce into idolatry.

The definite article is prefixed; it is not any kind of wickedness that is here denounced, but the special sin of idolatry, <span class="accented">the</span> wickedness <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. All idolatry was to be strictly suppressed - those convicted of it to be put to death by stoning. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 No creature which had any blemish was to be offered in sacrifice to God. We are thus called to remember the perfect, pure, and spotless sacrifice of Christ, and reminded to serve God with the best of our abilities, time, and possession, or our pretended obedience will be hateful to him. So great a punishment as death, so remarkable a death as stoning, must be inflicted on the Jewish idolater. Let all who in our day set up idols in their hearts, remember how God punished this crime in Israel.</body></html>
