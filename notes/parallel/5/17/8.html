The word "stroke" is the common word for "plague" in the Pentateuch and elsewhere. It may possibly refer to cases of ceremonial purity or impurity, especially in reference to disease. There is an evident allusion to this law in the history of King Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/19-8.htm" title="Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 19:8-10</a>). There the words are "between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments." The questions are (1) between two contending parties; (2) between the law as a general rule and its application to particular duties, institutions and requirements. Other passages in the same chapter recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/16-18.htm" title="Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Matters of controversy within thy gates</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the local courts of their several cities. The "gate" was the place of judgment. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-10.htm" title="And what cause soever shall come to you of your brothers that dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, you shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come on you, and on your brothers: this do, and you shall not trespass.">2Chronicles 19:10</a>, the phrase is more clearly expressed, thus, "what cause soever shall come unto you of your brethren that dwell <span class= "ital">in their cities."</span><p><span class= "bld">Into the place which the Lord thy God shall choose.</span>--This implies what was afterwards ordered before Moses' death, that the standard copy of the Law would be kept beside the Ark of the Covenant, in the sacred place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm" title="Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"the priests that come of the tribe of Levi" (Rashi). Some modern critics say the writer of Deuteronomy knew no distinction between priests and Levites; but see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm" title="And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the middle of all Israel:">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>, and also the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm" title="And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-25.htm" title="That Moses commanded the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,">Deuteronomy 31:25</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The priests, the Levites, and . . . the judge.</span>--The order agrees exactly with the constitution which Moses left behind him at his death. This has been already indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/27-15.htm" title="And Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,">Numbers 27:15-21</a>. Joshua was to "stand before Eleazar." Eleazar was to ask counsel from Jehovah, and at his word Joshua and all the people were to go in and out. The order, when the two are mentioned together in the Book of Joshua, is invariably "Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun," not <span class= "ital">vice versa. </span>The priests are the custodians of the Law; the judge or chief magistrate is the executor of it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7-8</a>.) The principle is not altered by the substitution of a king for the judge, or by the addition of a prophet.<p><span class= "bld">That shall be in those days.</span>--Rashi and the New Testament are curiously agreed in the application of this part of the commandment. Our Lord, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-2.htm" title="Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:">Matthew 23:2-3</a>, says of the Scribes and Pharisees (the judges of His day) that they "sit in Moses' seat: All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do." Rashi says here, "Although he is not like the rest of the judges that were before him, thou must hearken to him. <span class= "ital">There is no judge for thee except the judge that is in thy days."</span><p>(9-11) <span class= "bld">And they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment . . . According to the sentence of the law . . . thou shalt do.</span>--This passage should be carefully noted. The function of the priest and judge was to <span class= "ital">show, inform, teach, and tell the applicant the sentence of the law, i.e., </span>of the written law. The four English verbs have only three equivalents in Hebrew, viz., <span class= "ital">tell, teach and say. </span>It is not sufficiently observed that this defines the relation between the Church and the Bible from the time the Law (which was the germ of the Bible) was delivered to the Church, and that the relation between the Church and the Bible is the same to this day. The only authority wherewith the Church (of Israel, or of Christ) can "bind" or "loose," is the written Law of God. The binding (or forbidding) and loosing (or permitting) of the Rabbis--the authority which our Lord committed to His Church--was only the application of His written word. The Rabbis acknowledge this from one end of the Talmud to the other by the appeal to Scripture which is made in every page, sometimes in almost every line. The application is often strained or fanciful; but that does not alter the principle. <span class= "ital">The written word is the chain that binds. </span>Nor does the varying relation between the executive and legislative authority alter the principle. Where the law of Jehovah is the law of the land, death may be the penalty of disobedience. Where it is only the law of the Christian community, exclusion may be the extreme penalty that is possible. But still the relation between the written word and the ministers of the Church is the same. The Church is the "witness and keeper of Holy Writ," and can only <span class= "ital">shew </span>from thence the sentence of judgment. The sentence is an application of the law, not a mere invention of the authorities themselves; and it would be easy to show from history how every misapplication of the Divine code brought with it surely, sooner or later, its own refutation, and the overthrow of the unfaithful government. The prophets not seldom took the place of tribunes of the people in cases of oppression. No one lifted up a more distinct protest from the law itself against the misapplication of the law than the Prophet like unto Moses, who formally acknowledged the authority of them that sat in Moses' seat.<span class= "note">[3]<p>[3] Manifestly, when copies of the Law were scarce, and when a good deal of it, like this Book of Deuteronomy, was general, and even prophetic, a board of authorised interpreters, or <span class= "ital">appliers, </span>of the law to matters of detail was an absolute necessity. (See Introduction to Deuteronomy for more on this head.)<p>(</span>12<span class= "note">)</span> <span class= "bld">And the man that will do presumptuously . . . shall die.</span>--This word "presumptuously" occurs for the first time in this place. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-22.htm" title="When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken, but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously: you shall not be afraid of him.">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>.) It is connected with "pride," and denotes a proud self-assertion against the law. The penalty of death arises necessarily out of the theocracy. If God is the king of the nation, rebellion against His law is treason, and if it be proud and wilful rebellion, the penalty of death is only what we should expect to see inflicted. As soon as the law of Jehovah is in any way separated from the law of the land, this state of things may be altered. It is remarkable that in Ezra's commission from Artaxerxes we find permission to identify the law of Jehovah with the law of the Persian empire to the full extent of this precept, "Whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, <span class= "ital">whether it be unto death, </span>banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/7-25.htm" title="And you, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God, that is in your hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach you them that know them not.">Ezra 7:25-26</a>.) But such penalties, except in a theocratic government, are obviously out of place in matters connected with religion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-13.</span> - So long as Moses was with the people, they had in him one to whom, in the last resort, cases might be brought for decision which were found too difficult for the ordinary judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19-26</a>). But, as he was not to be always with them, it was needful to provide a supreme court, to which such cases might be carried when they could no longer be decided by him; and such a court is here appointed to be held at the sanctuary. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A matter too hard for thee</span>; literally, too <span class="accented">marvelous</span>; something extraordinary, and which could not be decided by the ordinary rules of the judicature. <span class="cmt_word">Between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in cases where blood had been shed and death had ensued, either accidentally or from murderous intent (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9</a>, etc.); in cases of disputed rights and claims (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-10.htm">2 Chronicles 19:10</a>); and in cases where corporeal injury had been suffered, whether in strife or from assault (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a>, etc.); and, in general, wherever <span class="cmt_word">matters of controversy</span> - disputes as to what was lawful and right, might arise in their towns and villages. In all such cases recourse was to be had to the court at the sanctuary - "to the priests the Levites," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the priests who were of the tribe of Levi, and to the judge presiding there - the lay judge associated with the high priest as president (see Oehler, in Herzog's 'Encyclop.,' vol. 5. p. 58). It is not intended by this that an appeal was to lie from the lower court to the higher, or that the parties in a suit might carry it at once to the supreme judge; the meaning rather is that, when the ordinary judges found a case too difficult for them to deal with, they were themselves to transmit it to the supreme court for decision. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8-13 Courts of judgment were to be set up in every city. Though their judgment had not the Divine authority of an oracle, it was the judgment of wise, prudent, experienced men, and had the advantage of a Divine promise.</body></html>
