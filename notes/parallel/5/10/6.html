The difficulty is two-fold. First, the account of Israel's marches about the time of Aaron's death is given in a different form here to that which we have in Numbers 20, 21, 33. Secondly, there is the further question why Aaron's death should be recorded here. It appears to have taken place before Moses began the delivery of the discourses in Deuteronomy. It is separated by thirty-nine years from the incidents which Moses is recapitulating in this passage. The Jewish commentator Rashi gives a very curious tale to account for the allusion to Aaron's death in this place. But though his theory is mythical, he seems to hit the main point, which is that Israel <span class= "ital">re-visited </span>in their journey round the land of Edom four places where they had previously encamped, and among them Mosera, or Moseroth, the district in which Mount Hor, where Aaron died, was situated. There is no impossibility in this; in fact, it is highly probable, and would partly account for the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4</a><span class= "ital">, </span>that "the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way." It was just about this time that the fiery serpents came.<p>If the connection of these verses with the train of thought in Moses' mind is <span class= "ital">spiritual, </span>the difficulty may be solved. <span class= "ital">The death of the priest of Israel, </span>whose first representative Aaron was, is spiritually identical with the destruction of the first pair of tables, the death of the first Adam and of all mankind in the person of our representative, the Lord Jesus Christ. After that death He "ariseth" as "another priest, made not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life." Thus the incident is connected with what goes before. The separation of the tribe of Levi <span class= "ital">"</span>to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"to bear the burden of the Law," is the same thing in another form. It deprives them of an earthly inheritance, just as He whose representatives they were gave Himself an offering and sacrifice to God; and "His life is taken from the earth."<p>Further, the names of the places themselves have in this aspect a spiritual significance. From certain "wells of water"--the wells of the children of Jaakan (crookedness)--the people of God take their journey to the scene of the high priest's death. From thence to Hor-hagidgad, or Gudgodah, the mount of the "troop," or "band" (Sinai is the mount of the "congregation" in the Old Testament, Zion in the New), and thence to <span class= "ital">a land </span>of <span class= "ital">rivers of water. </span>It is only another way of relating how from the wells of the Law we pass to the rivers of living water opened by the Gospel. But we must pass <span class= "ital">by way of the cross of Christ.</span><p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS ON NOTES TO DEUTERONOMY.</span><p>EXCURSUS ON <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a>.<p>THESE verses have always seemed to me to present the greatest difficulty in the whole of Deuteronomy. If it were not for their beautiful spiritual connection with the context, I should not know how to account for their presence in this place at all. And even so, the <span class= "ital">difference </span>between this allusion to Aaron's death and the account given in Numbers, and the superficial <span class= "ital">resemblance </span>between the four stages of the journey of Israel here mentioned, and four stages which belong to a different period (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-31.htm" title="And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.">Numbers 33:31-34</a>)--together create a somewhat formidable perplexity. The Samaritan Pentateuch increases the confusion by introducing here the stages mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-34.htm" title="And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.">Numbers 33:34-37</a><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a> supports the Hebrew text. The fact that the <span class= "ital">burial </span>of <span class= "ital">Aaron is alluded to in this place only,</span> shows that the verses in Deuteronomy cannot have been taken from those in Numbers. The following comparison will show the difference.<p>In THE FOURTH PERIOD OF THE EXODUS.<p>IN THE FIFTH PERIOD OF THE EXODUS.<p>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-30.htm" title="And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.">Numbers 33:30-33</a>.)<p>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a>.)<p>"The children of Israel journeyed from <span class= "ital">Hash-monah </span>to <span class= "ital">Moseroth; </span>from <span class= "ital">Moseroth </span>to <span class= "ital">Bene-jaakan; </span>from <span class= "ital">Bene-jaakan </span>to <span class= "ital">Hor-hagidgad; </span>from <span class= "ital">Hor-hagidgad </span>to <span class= "ital">Jotbathah."</span><p>Three other encampments--at Ebronah,Ezion-gaber, and Kadesh--intervened before their arrival at Mount Hor, where Aaron died, in the fifth period of the Exodus, on the first day of the month.<p>N.B.-The fourth period of the Exodus has no <span class= "ital">dates </span>mentioned.<p>The fifth period begins with the death of Miriam at Kadesh in the first month of the fortieth year. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>.<p>"The children of Israel journeyed from <span class= "ital">Beeroth-bene-jaakan </span>to <span class= "ital">Mosera, </span>(where Aaron died and was buried), from <span class= "ital">Mosera </span>to <span class= "ital">Gudgodah; </span>from <span class= "ital">Gud-godah </span>to <span class= "ital">Jotbath, </span>a land of rivers of waters."<p>Mosera is singular, M<span class= "ital">oseroth </span>plural in form. Bene-jaakan means "the children of Jaakan"--Beeroth-bene-jaakan the <span class= "ital">wells </span>of the children of Jaakan. Hor-hagidgad means the mount of Gid-gad, which differs from Gudgod only in the vowel pointing. Gudgodah may mean the neighbourhood of Gudgod or Gidgad, and Jotbathah may mean simply <span class= "ital">to </span>Jotbath.<p><span class= "ital">Gadgad </span>and <span class= "ital">Etebatha </span>are found both in Numbers and Deuteronomy in the LXX. The other names are given with some variation.<p>The places are not mentioned in the same order in the two passages, and the difference in the form of the words shows that neither passage is copied from the other. All four sites are at present unknown. The additional particulars given in Deuteronomy suggest a reason why Israel should re-visit two of the four places; namely, because of the <span class= "ital">water </span>which was to be had from the <span class= "ital">wells </span>of the children of Jaakan and in Jotbath, the "land of <span class= "ital">rivers of waters."</span><p>The return of Israel in the last period of the Exodus to four places previously visited is in no way remarkable. We are told that they were compelled, about the time of Aaron's death, to "journey from Mount Hor to <span class= "ital">compass </span>the land of Edom," which the Edomites would not permit them to cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-21.htm" title="Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: why Israel turned away from him.">Numbers 20:21</a>). The return to these former encampments may have enhanced the weariness and annoyance of the people, so that "their soul was much discouraged because of the way," and if they were travelling in a different direction, they may well have revisited these four places in a different order. They need not have <span class= "ital">encamped </span>at all of them the second time. The narrative in Deuteronomy merely says "they <span class= "ital">journeyed from," </span>not "they <span class= "ital">encamped in." </span>There is no reason why the district of Mount Hor may not have been called <span class= "ital">Mosera </span>or <span class= "ital">Moseroth. </span>And the name "chastisement" may have been given to it by Moses, like many other significant names in the Exodus (Meribah, Kibroth-hattaavah &c), in consequence of what took place there.<p>Further there is some reason to believe that the number of the "goings out" of Israel in the Exodus, given in Numbers 33 is made to be 42 for a special reason, like the forty-two generations of Matthew 1, in which there are at least three evidently intentional omissions. And therefore we need not be surprised at the insertion of places elsewhere, which are not included in that list. <span class= "ital">No place is mentioned twice </span>in Numbers 33. Yet the children of Israel were certainly twice at Kadesh (for <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm" title="And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.">Numbers 13:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>, <span class= "ital">cannot </span>refer to the same <span class= "ital">time</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and probably twice at many other places.<p>The real difficulty is not in the <span class= "ital">facts </span>related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a>, but in the question <span class= "ital">why they should be narrated there. </span>Further, they are narrated in the third person, "<span class= "ital">the children of Israel journeyed," </span>but all the other portions of their journey are narrated in the first person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm" title="And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>, <span class= "ital">we </span>went; and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-1.htm" title="Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.">Deuteronomy 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm" title="And when we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-13.htm" title="Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.">Deuteronomy 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm" title="Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.">Deuteronomy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-26.htm" title="But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.">Deuteronomy 3:26</a>). A reader of Deuteronomy who was not already familiar with the earlier books, would naturally suppose that <span class= "ital">at this period of the discourse </span>the children of Israel did journey, as the narrative says. It is only by close attention that the verses are seen to refer to a time previous to the beginning of the book, but much later than the events recapitulated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm" title="And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>.<p>In form, these verses correspond to what may be called the historical or editorial, as distinct from the hortatory portions of Deuteronomy; as the title, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1-5</a>; the parenthetical notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/2-10.htm" title="The Emims dwelled therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;">Deuteronomy 2:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/2-20.htm" title="(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelled therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;">Deuteronomy 2:20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-41.htm" title="Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;">Deuteronomy 4:41-43</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44-49</a>; with the historical portions of the last six chapters of the book.<p>Upon the whole, I am disposed to think that the only reason for the insertion of these verses is the spiritual reason which I have given in the notes.<p>From the wells of the children of Jaakan, or <span class= "ital">perversity, </span>the people of God removed to Mosera the place of <span class= "ital">chastisement, </span>where their great High Priest<span class= "note">[12]</span> died and was buried; and another priest arose in his stead. From thence they journeyed unto the mount of the <span class= "ital">congregation </span>(Gudgod or Gidgad; compare <span class= "ital">Gad</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and from thence to <span class= "ital">Jotbath </span>(of which the root is <span class= "ital">good </span>or <span class= "ital">goodness</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>a land of <span class= "ital">rivers of waters</span>--the usual symbol in Scripture for the Holy Spirit given on Mount Zion, the "mount of the congregation" of Jehovah. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37-39</a>.)<p><span class= "note">[12] The following passage from the Talmudical treatise, <span class= "ital">Pirke Aboth of Rabbi Nathan </span>(section 34), may serve to show that the comparison between Christ and Aaron is not peculiar to the New Testament:--"These are the two sons of fresh oil who stand by the Lord of the whole earth" (</span><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-14.htm" title="Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:14</a><span class= "note">). "These are Aaron and Messiah. And I cannot say which of them is the best beloved. But when he saith (Ps. Exodus 4), Jehovah hath sworn and will not repent, Thou art priest for ever, then I know that the King Messiah is beloved above the Priest of Righteousness."</span><p>The explanations given by the Jewish commentators are of a spiritual character, and <span class= "ital">in principle </span>I am disposed to think them correct, though the details are far too fanciful for reproduction, or for our present acceptance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - Not only did God, of his grace and in response to the intercession of Moses, give to the people, notwithstanding their apostasy, the ark of the covenant with the new tables of the Law, but he followed this up by instituting the high priesthood; and, when Aaron died, caused it to be continued to his son Eleazar. This Moses reminds the people of by referring to a fact in their past history, viz. their arrival at Mosera, where Aaron died, and Eleazar succeeded him in his office. <span class="cmt_word">Beeroth of the children of Jaakan</span> (<span class="accented">wells of the sons of Jaakan</span>); the same place as Bene-jaakan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-31.htm">Numbers 33:31</a>), probably the Horite tribe, called 'Akan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-27.htm">Genesis 36:27</a>), for which, apparently, should be read Jakan, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-42.htm">1 Chronicles 1:42</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Mosera</span>; Moseroth, plu. of Mosera (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-30.htm">Numbers 33:30</a>). As Aaron died there, Mosera must have been in the vicinity of Mount Her. <span class="cmt_word">Gudgodah</span>, Hor-hagidgad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-32.htm">Numbers 33:32</a>); <span class="accented">cave of Gidgad</span>, a place of caves. Jotbath, <span class="cmt_word">Jotbathah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-33.htm">Numbers 33:33</a>), a district abounding in streams, whence probably its name, <span class="accented">Jot-bathah</span>, pleasantness, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to be good, to please. None of these places have been identified. Robinson mentions a Wady cf. Ghadaghidh, a broad sandy valley diverging from the Wady es Jerafeh, in the desert of Et-Tih, and this has been supposed to indicate the site of Gudgodah; but the difference of the consonants in the two words is such as to render this identification more than doubtful. In the Arabic of the London Polyglott, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d4;</span> is represented by (<span class="accented">Judjuda</span>), which is totally different from <span class="accented">Ghadaghidh</span>. All the places, however, must have been in the 'Arabah, and in the region of Mount Her, or not far distant. That the places mentioned here are the same as those in Numbers cannot be doubted. The two passages, however, relate to different journeys; that in Numbers to the journeying of the Israelites from the wilderness of Sinai to Kadesh, that in Deuteronomy to the march in the fortieth year, when they went from Kadesh to Mount Her. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 Moses reminded the Israelites of God's great mercy to them, notwithstanding their provocations. There were four things in and by which the Lord showed himself reconciled to Israel. God gave them his law. Thus God has intrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, and sacraments, as tokens of his presence and favour. God led them forward toward Canaan. He appointed a standing ministry among them for holy things. And now, under the gospel, when the pouring forth of the Spirit is more plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's work on men's hearts, qualifying and making some willing for that work in every age. God accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and therefore appointed him to be their prince and leader. Moses was a type of Christ, who ever lives, pleading for us, and has all power in heaven and in earth.</body></html>
