he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.">Exodus 34:28</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Hew thee two tables of stone . . . and make thee an ark.</span>--The command to make the ark was given in the former period of forty days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm" title="And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:10</a>); the command to hew the two tables was given after Moses had seen the glory of God (Exodus 33) from the cleft in the rock, but before the forty days spent in intercession. Rashi, the Jewish commentator, thinks there were two arks: one to go out to war, and the other to remain in the tabernacle. But there is no foundation for this statement. There may, of course, have been a temporary receptacle for the tables made by Moses (like the temporary tabernacle mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.">Exodus 33:7</a>), to receive them until the completion of the ark which Bezaleel was to make. This was not put in hand until after Moses descended with the second pair of tables. (See Exodus 35 &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time.</span> When Moses thus interceded, God commanded him to prepare two new tables of stone, and to construct an ark in which to keep them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>, etc.). Directions had been given for the construction of the ark before the apostasy of the people, and it was not made till after the tabernacle had been erected, nor were the tables placed in it till the tabernacle had been consecrated (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>, etc.; Exodus 40:20). But as the things themselves were closely connected, Moses mentions them here together, without regard to chronological order. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 Moses reminded the Israelites of God's great mercy to them, notwithstanding their provocations. There were four things in and by which the Lord showed himself reconciled to Israel. God gave them his law. Thus God has intrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, and sacraments, as tokens of his presence and favour. God led them forward toward Canaan. He appointed a standing ministry among them for holy things. And now, under the gospel, when the pouring forth of the Spirit is more plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's work on men's hearts, qualifying and making some willing for that work in every age. God accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and therefore appointed him to be their prince and leader. Moses was a type of Christ, who ever lives, pleading for us, and has all power in heaven and in earth.</body></html>
