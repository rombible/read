(Rashi). The Rabbis have drawn this exposition from hence: "Everything is in the hand of Heaven (to bestow), save only the fear of Heaven." But it is written elsewhere, "I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me." (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm" title="He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - God had showed great favor to Israel; what return did he require?

"Fear <span class="accented">with</span> love! Love without fear relaxes; fear without love enslaves, and leads to despair" (J. Gerhard). There is a fear with which love cannot coexist - a fear which hath torment, and which love casts out as its antagonist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>); but the fear of God which he requires is that pious reverence which not only can coexist with love to him, but is not where love is not. <span class="cmt_word">And to serve the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</span> Love prompts to service. Wherever love fills the heart, it seeks expression in acts of service to its object; and where no such expression comes forth, the evidence is wanting of the existence of the emotion in the bosom (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For thy good</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>). "In serving the Lord the glory redoundeth unto him, the benefit to ourselves; for them that honor him he will honor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>), and 'godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>)" (Ainsworth). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-22 We are here taught our duty to God in our principles and our practices. We must fear the Lord our God. We must love him, and delight in communion with him. We must walk in the ways in which he has appointed us to walk. We must serve him with all our heart and soul. What we do in his service we must do cheerfully, and with good will. We must keep his commandments. There is true honour and pleasure in obedience. We must give honour to God; and to him we must cleave, as one we love and delight in, trust in, and from whom we have great expectations. We are here taught our duty to our neighbour. God's common gifts to mankind oblige us to honour all men. And those who have themselves been in distress, and have found mercy with God, should be ready to show kindness to those who are in the like distress. We are here taught our duty to ourselves. Circumcise your hearts. Cast away all corrupt affections and inclinations, which hinder you from fearing and loving God. By nature we do not love God. This is original sin, the source whence our wickedness proceeds; and the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God, Ro 8:5-9. Let us, without delay or reserve, come and cleave to our reconciled God in Jesus Christ, that we may love, serve, and obey him acceptably, and be daily changed into his image, from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord. Consider the greatness and glory of God; and his goodness and grace; these persuade us to our duty. Blessed Spirit! Oh for thy purifying, persevering, and renewing influences, that being called out of the state of strangers, such as our fathers were, we may be found among the number of the children of God, and that our lot may be among the saints.</body></html>
