The appointment of the tribe of Levi for service took place in connection with that of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>). The service to which the tribe of Levi was chosen appertained to the tribe as such, including the priests as well as the non-priestly Levites, though parts of it specially belonged to the one class rather than the other. Thus the <span class="cmt_word">bearing of the ark</span> was the special duty of non-priestly Levites, the Kohathites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-15.htm">1 Chronicles 15:15</a>); but was also, on peculiarly solemn occasions, discharged by the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>, etc.; Joshua 6:6; 8:33; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3, 6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To stand before the Lord to minister</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto him</span> was the special function of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-46.htm">Ezekiel 40:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15, 16</a>); but as the service of the Levites was also a sacred service, they too are said to stand to minister before the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4, 5, 11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bless in his name</span> does not mean, as some propose, to invoke the Name of God, or to praise his Name, but to pronounce a benediction or invoke a blessing on the people in his Name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-18.htm">2 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a>). This was the special duty of the priests (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a>), but might also be done by others (as by David), and in this benediction the Levites might join (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 Moses reminded the Israelites of God's great mercy to them, notwithstanding their provocations. There were four things in and by which the Lord showed himself reconciled to Israel. God gave them his law. Thus God has intrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, and sacraments, as tokens of his presence and favour. God led them forward toward Canaan. He appointed a standing ministry among them for holy things. And now, under the gospel, when the pouring forth of the Spirit is more plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's work on men's hearts, qualifying and making some willing for that work in every age. God accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and therefore appointed him to be their prince and leader. Moses was a type of Christ, who ever lives, pleading for us, and has all power in heaven and in earth.</body></html>
