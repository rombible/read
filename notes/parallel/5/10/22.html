If the marvellous increase of Israel in the time allowed by the sacred narrative presents a difficulty, we must remember that the Bible consistently represents the multiplication as the <span class= "ital">fulfilment of a Divine promise, </span>and not purely natural. But the testimony of the First Book of Chronicles must not be overlooked. The genealogy of Judah, given in the second and fourth chapters of that book, discloses a very extensive multiplication, a good deal of which must lie within the period of the sojourning in Egypt. The family of Hezron is particularly to be noticed. Of a certain descendant of Simeon it is written (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-27.htm" title="And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters: but his brothers had not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children of Judah.">1Chronicles 4:27</a>), "And Shimei had <span class= "ital">sixteen sons and six daughters; </span>but his brethren had not many children, <span class= "ital">neither did all their family multiply like to the children of Judah." </span>(!) Modern calculations are perhaps not quite adequate to deal with such a rate of increase as this. (See also the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm" title="When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - Among other marvelous acts toward Israel, was one done in Israel itself; they, whoso fathers went down to Egypt only seventy in number (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26, 27</a>), had, notwithstanding the cruel oppression to which they were subjected there, grown to a nation numberless as the stars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-23.htm">Nehemiah 9:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-22 We are here taught our duty to God in our principles and our practices. We must fear the Lord our God. We must love him, and delight in communion with him. We must walk in the ways in which he has appointed us to walk. We must serve him with all our heart and soul. What we do in his service we must do cheerfully, and with good will. We must keep his commandments. There is true honour and pleasure in obedience. We must give honour to God; and to him we must cleave, as one we love and delight in, trust in, and from whom we have great expectations. We are here taught our duty to our neighbour. God's common gifts to mankind oblige us to honour all men. And those who have themselves been in distress, and have found mercy with God, should be ready to show kindness to those who are in the like distress. We are here taught our duty to ourselves. Circumcise your hearts. Cast away all corrupt affections and inclinations, which hinder you from fearing and loving God. By nature we do not love God. This is original sin, the source whence our wickedness proceeds; and the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God, Ro 8:5-9. Let us, without delay or reserve, come and cleave to our reconciled God in Jesus Christ, that we may love, serve, and obey him acceptably, and be daily changed into his image, from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord. Consider the greatness and glory of God; and his goodness and grace; these persuade us to our duty. Blessed Spirit! Oh for thy purifying, persevering, and renewing influences, that being called out of the state of strangers, such as our fathers were, we may be found among the number of the children of God, and that our lot may be among the saints.</body></html>
