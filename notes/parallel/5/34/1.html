The word seems to mean a height.<p>(1, 2) <span class= "bld">The Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali . . . unto the utmost sea</span>--that is, He showed him all the land which was to be given to these several tribes. Whether He then showed it to him under the names which are given here or not is a question we cannot answer. Many deeply interesting queries suggest themselves here. Did Moses go up alone? or did Joshua accompany him? Who wrote these particulars of <span class= "ital">what </span>was shown to him, and how were the particulars known? I am disposed to believe that as Elijah and Elisha "still went on and talked," until that chariot of fire appeared which "parted them both asunder," so it was with Moses and Joshua--that Moses' minister attended him until Jehovah withdrew him from his sight. But it speaks well for Joshua's character--in fact, it is altogether characteristic of the man--that in this record of the death of the great lawgiver he should have concealed himself and every other figure from sight except Jehovah and His servant Moses. Rashi, in his comment on this scene, says that the Lord showed Moses not only the land, but what should happen therein, in every part. But of this we know nothing. We know that the spectacle was complete. Probably "the eye that was not dim" was enabled to see farther than human eye ever saw from such a height before. "The utmost sea" is full fifty miles away from that spot.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto Mount Nebo</span>, <span class="accented">the summit of Pisgah</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Gilead unto Dan.</span> Not Dan Laish, near the central source of the Jordan, which was not in Gilead, but another Dan in Northern Perea, the site of which has not yet been discovered (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-4 Moses seemed unwilling to leave his work; but that being finished, he manifested no unwillingness to die.

Such a sight believers now have, through grace, of the bliss and glory of their future state. Sometimes God reserves the brightest discoveries of his grace to his people to support their dying moments. Those may leave this world with cheerfulness, who die in the faith of Christ, and in the hope of heaven.</body></html>
