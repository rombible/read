The difference is most clearly set forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7-8</a>. (See Notes on that passage.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Whom the Lord knew.</span> "For the Lord was revealed to him face to face" (Onkelos). The knowledge here referred to was not merely that cognizance which God as the Omniscient has of all men, but that special knowledge by which men, being known of God, are made to know him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>). The statement in this verse could only have been inserted some time after the death of Moses, and after the people had had manifestations of God's presence with them, both by communications from him through the prophets and by the successes which he had given them over their enemies. But it is not necessary to suppose that a long period during which a lengthened succession of prophets had arisen had elapsed. "<span class="accented">Moses</span> was the founder and mediator of the old covenant. As long as this covenant was to last, no prophet could arise in Israel like unto Moses. There is but One who is worthy of greater honor than Moses, namely, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, who is placed as a Son over all the house of God, in which Moses was found faithful as a servant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2-6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), Jesus Christ, the Founder and Mediator of the new and everlasting covenant" (Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:9-12 Moses brought Israel to the borders of Canaan, and then died and left them. This signifies that the law made nothing perfect, Heb 7:19 It brings men into a wilderness of conviction, but not into the Canaan of rest and settled peace. That honour was reserved for Joshua, our Lord Jesus, of whom Joshua was a type, (and the name is the same,) to do that for us which the law could not do, Ro 8:3. Through him we enter into the spiritual rest of conscience, and eternal rest in heaven. Moses was greater than any other prophet of the Old Testament. But our Lord Jesus went beyond him, far more than the other prophets came short of him. And see a strong resemblance between the redeemer of the children of Israel and the Redeemer of mankind. Moses was sent by God, to deliver the Israelites form a cruel bondage; he led them out, and conquered their enemies. He became not only their deliverer, but their lawgiver; not only their lawgiver, but their judge; and, finally, leads them to the border of the land of promise. Our blessed Saviour came to rescue us out of the slavery of the devil, and to restore us to liberty and happiness. He came to confirm every moral precept of the first lawgiver; and to write them, not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart. He came to be our Judge also, inasmuch as he hath appointed a day when he will judge all the secrets of men, and reward or punish accordingly. This greatness of Christ above Moses, is a reason why Christians should be obedient and faithful to the holy religion by which they profess to be Christ's followers. God, by his grace, make us all so!</body></html>
