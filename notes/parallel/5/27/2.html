<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster,</span> The stones, the number of which is not specified, were to be large, because much was to be inscribed upon them, and they were to be covered with a coating of lime or gypsum (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>), in order to secure a smooth white surface on which the inscription might be clearly depicted. That the words were not, as Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and others suppose, cut in the stone, and afterwards covered with plaster in order to preserve them, is plain from its being enjoined that they were to be written upon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) the stones so prepared; and besides, as this was intended to be a <span class="accented">proclamation</span> of the Law, the main purpose of the erection would have been frustrated had the inscription been concealed by such a covering as that supposed. Among the ancient Egyptians the practice of depicting records on walls or monuments covered with a coating of plaster was common (see Hengstenberg, 'Authentic des Pent.,' 1:464, English translation, 1:433); from them, doubtless, it was borrowed by the Hebrews. It has been suggested by Kennicott that the writing was to be in <span class="accented">relieve</span>, and that the spaces between the letters were filled up by the mortar or cement. This is possible, but it is not such a process as this that the words of the text suggest. "A careful examination of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4, 8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a>-22, will lead to the opinion that the Law was <span class="accented">written upon</span> or <span class="accented">in the plaster</span> with which these pillars were coated. This could easily be done, and such writing was common in ancient times. I have seen specimens of it certainly more than <span class="accented">two thousand years old</span>, and still as distinct as when they were first inscribed on the plaster" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' it. p. 204). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-10 As soon as they were come into Canaan, they must set up a monument, on which they must write the words of this law. They must set up an altar. The word and prayer must go together. Though they might not, of their own heads, set up any altar besides that at the tabernacle; yet, by the appointment of God, they might, upon special occasion. This altar must be made of unhewn stones, such as they found upon the field. Christ, our Altar, is a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, refused by the builders, as having no form or comeliness, but accepted of God the Father, and made the Head of the corner. In the Old Testament the words of the law are written, with the curse annexed; which would overcome us with horror, if we had not, in the New Testament, an altar erected close by, which gives consolation. Blessed be God, the printed copies of the Scriptures among us, do away the necessity of such methods as were presented to Israel. The end of the gospel ministry is, and the end of preachers ought to be, to make the word of God as plain as possible. Yet, unless the Spirit of God prosper such labours with Divine power, we shall not, even by these means, be made wise unto salvation: for this blessing we should therefore daily and earnestly pray.</body></html>
