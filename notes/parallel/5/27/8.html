All else in the Law of Moses is but an application of the Decalogue to a particular people under particular circumstances. (See Notes on Joshua 3, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-32.htm" title="And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.">Joshua 8:32</a>, for more upon the relation of the ten commandments to the conquest of Canaan.)<p><span class= "bld">Very plainly.</span>--See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm" title="On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>. Rashi says, "In seventy (<span class= "ital">.e., </span>in all) languages." There is also an idea in the Talmud that when spoken from Sinai, the Law was spoken (or heard) in all languages at the same time. It is a strange refraction of the truth indicated at Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was given. Men spake in every tongue the wonderful works of God. The foundation of Jerusalem has effects exactly opposite to the foundation of Babylon (Genesis 11).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The injunction to write the Law on the stones is repeated, with the addition that it was to be done very plainly (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>: Vulgate, plane <span class="accented">et lucide</span>), which shows that the main purpose of setting up the stones was that the Law might be easily known by the people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>). The stones and the altar were fittingly placed on Ebal, the mount of cursing. For the setting up of the stones on which the Law was inscribed, and the building beside them of the altar, was the symbolical renewal of the covenant of God with Israel, and the establishment in Canaan of that dispensation which was "the ministration of condemnation and of death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7, 9</a>), and of that Law which, though in itself "holy, just, and <span class="accented">good</span>," can only, because of man's perversity and sinfulness, bring on those who are under it a curse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-10 As soon as they were come into Canaan, they must set up a monument, on which they must write the words of this law. They must set up an altar. The word and prayer must go together. Though they might not, of their own heads, set up any altar besides that at the tabernacle; yet, by the appointment of God, they might, upon special occasion. This altar must be made of unhewn stones, such as they found upon the field. Christ, our Altar, is a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, refused by the builders, as having no form or comeliness, but accepted of God the Father, and made the Head of the corner. In the Old Testament the words of the law are written, with the curse annexed; which would overcome us with horror, if we had not, in the New Testament, an altar erected close by, which gives consolation. Blessed be God, the printed copies of the Scriptures among us, do away the necessity of such methods as were presented to Israel. The end of the gospel ministry is, and the end of preachers ought to be, to make the word of God as plain as possible. Yet, unless the Spirit of God prosper such labours with Divine power, we shall not, even by these means, be made wise unto salvation: for this blessing we should therefore daily and earnestly pray.</body></html>
