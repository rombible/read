The blessings are not here recorded; but when the injunction here given was fulfilled by Joshua, the blessing as well as the curse was pronounced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-34.htm">Joshua 8:34</a>). And probably, as the Jews report, each, the blessing and the curse, was pronounced alternately (Talmud Bab., 'Sotah,' p. 7; Targum Hieros., <span class="accented">in loc</span>.; Surcnhus., 'Mishna,' 3:262). It has sometimes been doubted whether any human voice could be audible over so wide a stretch as that between these two mountains; but this need be no longer matter of doubt, for the experiment has been repeatedly tried in recent times with success (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 150; Bonar, p. 371; Stanley, 'Syr. and Pal.,' p. 13). In the clear atmosphere of the East sounds travel far. It is to be borne in mind also that it was not a single voice that had to make itself heard across the valley on this occasion, but a chorus of voices pro-seeding from a body of priests stationed apparently in the midst between the two companies (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>), and chanting in unison the words of each blessing or curse. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-26.</span> - Each of the first eleven curses is directed against some particular sin already denounced in the Law. The twelfth curse is directed generally against all breaches of the Law, against those who fail or refuse to set up the whole Law and follow it as the rule of life and conduct. This shows that the sins specially denounced are selected by way of specimen, and also, perhaps, because they are such as could for the most part be easily concealed from judicial inspection. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-23.htm">Leviticus 18:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23</span>. - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9, 17</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7, 8</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-3.htm">Jeremiah 11:3, 4</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:11-26 The six tribes appointed for blessing, were all children of the free women, for to such the promise belongs, Ga 4:31. Levi is here among the rest. Ministers should apply to themselves the blessing and curse they preach to others, and by faith set their own Amen to it. And they must not only allure people to their duty with the promises of a blessing, but awe them with the threatenings of a curse, by declaring that a curse would be upon those who do such things. To each of the curses the people were to say, Amen. It professed their faith, that these, and the like curses, were real declarations of the wrath of God against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, not one jot of which shall fall to the ground. It was acknowledging the equity of these curses. Those who do such things deserve to fall, and lie under the curse. Lest those who were guilty of other sins, not here mentioned, should think themselves safe from the curse, the last reaches all. Not only those who do the evil which the law forbids, but those also who omit the good which the law requires. Without the atoning blood of Christ, sinners can neither have communion with a holy God, nor do any thing acceptable to him; his righteous law condemns every one who, at any time, or in any thing, transgresses it. Under its awful curse we remain as transgressors, until the redemption of Christ is applied to our hearts. Wherever the grace of God brings salvation, it teaches the believer to deny ungodliness and wordly lusts, to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, consenting to, and delighting in the words of God's law, after the inward man. In this holy walk, true peace and solid joy are to be found.</body></html>
