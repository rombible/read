If we mark off the first offence specified, secret idolatry--the only one which distinctly recalls the <span class= "ital">first </span>commandment of the Law, and also the last general curse which embraces all transgression whatever, the intervening offences seem more easily arranged. We have duty to parents enforced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-16.htm" title="Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:16</a>) and the rights of neighbours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-17.htm" title="You shall not kill.">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>), the blind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-18.htm" title="Cursed be he that makes the blind to wander out of the way.

And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>) come next. The next four precepts are all concerned with purity, first in the nearer, afterwards in the more distant relations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/27-20.htm" title="Cursed be he that lies with his father's wife; because he uncovers his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:20-23</a>). The last two precepts concern slander and treachery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/27-24.htm" title="Cursed be he that smites his neighbor secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:24-25</a>). Evidently the offences specified are examples of whole classes of actions; and the twelve curses may have some reference to the number of the tribes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:11-26 The six tribes appointed for blessing, were all children of the free women, for to such the promise belongs, Ga 4:31. Levi is here among the rest. Ministers should apply to themselves the blessing and curse they preach to others, and by faith set their own Amen to it. And they must not only allure people to their duty with the promises of a blessing, but awe them with the threatenings of a curse, by declaring that a curse would be upon those who do such things. To each of the curses the people were to say, Amen. It professed their faith, that these, and the like curses, were real declarations of the wrath of God against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, not one jot of which shall fall to the ground. It was acknowledging the equity of these curses. Those who do such things deserve to fall, and lie under the curse. Lest those who were guilty of other sins, not here mentioned, should think themselves safe from the curse, the last reaches all. Not only those who do the evil which the law forbids, but those also who omit the good which the law requires. Without the atoning blood of Christ, sinners can neither have communion with a holy God, nor do any thing acceptable to him; his righteous law condemns every one who, at any time, or in any thing, transgresses it. Under its awful curse we remain as transgressors, until the redemption of Christ is applied to our hearts. Wherever the grace of God brings salvation, it teaches the believer to deny ungodliness and wordly lusts, to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, consenting to, and delighting in the words of God's law, after the inward man. In this holy walk, true peace and solid joy are to be found.</body></html>
