It would seem that the passage of Jordan, which is the thing in view here, pledged Israel more completely to God's Law than even the covenant at Sinai did. He had gone farther with them, and given them a more distinct position. It became more necessary than ever that they should remember whose they were.<p>(12,13) <span class= "bld">These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless . . . and these . . . upon mount Ebal to curse.</span>--The expressions "to bless" and "to curse" are misleading. It is not meant that six tribes were to bless, and six to curse their brethren. The phrase will be best understood by noticing the manner in which the ceremony was performed, according to Jewish tradition. According to the treatise <span class= "ital">Sotah, </span>six, tribes went up to the top of Gerizim, and six ascended mount Ebal, and the priests and the Levites and the ark remained below, between the hills. The Levites turned their faces towards Mount Gerizim, and began with the blessing, "Blessed is the man," &c., and both sides answered "Amen." They then turned their faces towards Mount Ebal, and began the curse, saying, "Cursed is the man," &c. The "Amen" again resounded; and the process was repeated until the last curse was reached. The question whether all the blessings preceded all the cursings is discussed; but the opinion preferred is, that each blessing had its corresponding curse, and were pronounced alternately.<p>If this account be correct, and it seems both intelligible and probable, we see that the tribes were divided equally to "receive" the blessing and the curse, implying that all were equally liable to either, according as they should obey or transgress. If the one side had answered amen to the blessings, and the other to the curses, the tribes would literally have blessed and cursed the people. But the rule is explicit that <span class= "ital">all </span>the people shall say "Amen;" and therefore we seem to gather this meaning from the Hebrew: These shall stand on Mount Gerizim for the blessing of the people, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to receive the blessing on behalf of the whole, and these on Mount Ebal for the curse (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to receive it on behalf of the rest). It is noticeable that "the law" which inflicts the curse, and the altar which represents in its sacrifices Him who bare the curse, are both on the same hill, Ebal. If the tribes redeemed are on the hill of blessing, the tribes that receive the curse are on the same hill with the Redeemer.<p>(12,13) <span class= "bld">Simeon, and Levi . . . and Naphtali.</span>--Strictly speaking, there would be seven tribes on Gerizim to receive the blessing, and six on Ebal for the curse; because, tribally, Joseph must include Ephraim and Manasseh. The general position is that of the audience in an amphitheatre, the speakers being in the centre beneath, and the people on either side above. The more honourable tribes of Judah, Joseph, Benjamin, and Levi are posted on the southern hill, Gerizim. The tribes on Ebal are the four sons of the handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah, with Leah's youngest son Zebulun; and the disinherited firstborn, Reuben, is placed at their head. These last tribes, upon the whole, may be said to have occupied the outer circle of Israel's territory, to the east and to the north. The tribes on Gerizim are the more central tribes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - When Israel renewed the covenant with the Lord, by solemnly setting up the Law in Canaan, it became thereby the nation of God, and bound itself at the same time to hearken to the voice of the Lord, and keep his commandments, as it had already done (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take heed</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Be silent</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>, with silent attention listen (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-10 As soon as they were come into Canaan, they must set up a monument, on which they must write the words of this law. They must set up an altar. The word and prayer must go together. Though they might not, of their own heads, set up any altar besides that at the tabernacle; yet, by the appointment of God, they might, upon special occasion. This altar must be made of unhewn stones, such as they found upon the field. Christ, our Altar, is a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, refused by the builders, as having no form or comeliness, but accepted of God the Father, and made the Head of the corner. In the Old Testament the words of the law are written, with the curse annexed; which would overcome us with horror, if we had not, in the New Testament, an altar erected close by, which gives consolation. Blessed be God, the printed copies of the Scriptures among us, do away the necessity of such methods as were presented to Israel. The end of the gospel ministry is, and the end of preachers ought to be, to make the word of God as plain as possible. Yet, unless the Spirit of God prosper such labours with Divine power, we shall not, even by these means, be made wise unto salvation: for this blessing we should therefore daily and earnestly pray.</body></html>
