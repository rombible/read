A wonder was a miracle, the performance of which gave proof of a Divine commission (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). These signs, it is assumed, should come to pass; nevertheless, the people were not to listen to the man who gave them to go after other gods. The mere fact that he sought to persuade them to forsake the worship of Jehovah was sufficient to prove him an impostor; for how could one who sought to seduce the people from God be sent by God? The sign which was given to authenticate such a message could only be one of those "lying signs and wonders after the working of Satan," by which his emissaries try to deceive and mislead; and was permitted by God only that their fidelity to him might be tested and proved. They had already received God's message; they had his word; and no teaching which contravened that, however apparently authenticated, could be from him, or was to he accepted by them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>, etc.). Come what might, they were to <span class="cmt_word">walk after Jehovah their God, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and serve him; and cleave unto him.</span> The false prophet, as a public enemy and a suborner of treason against the King of Israel, was to be put to death; and so the evil would be put away from among them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-5 Moses had cautioned against the peril that might arise from the Canaanites. Here he cautions against the rise of idolatry among themselves. It is needful for us to be well acquainted with the truths and precepts of the Bible; for we may expect to be proved by temptations of evil under the appearance of good, of error in the guise of truth; nor can any thing rightly oppose such temptations, but the plain, express testimony of God's word to the contrary. And it would be a proof of sincere affection for God, that, notwithstanding specious pretences, they should not be wrought upon the forsake God, and follow other gods to serve them.</body></html>
