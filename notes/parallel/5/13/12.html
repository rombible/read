We may fairly assume the abominations done there to have been connected with idolatry, from the allusions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm" title="They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.">Hosea 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-9.htm" title="O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.">Hosea 10:9</a>. But the outrage rather than the idolatry seems to have excited the indignation of Israel (see Judges 20, 21). It is noticeable that in the remonstrance with the Benjamites at Gibeah--(<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-13.htm" title="Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.">Judges 20:13</a>): "Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we <span class= "ital">may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel"</span>--there seems to be an allusion to the language of this chapter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-5.htm" title="And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he has spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust you out of the way which the LORD your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put the evil away from the middle of you.">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-11.htm" title="And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - A third ease supposed is that of the inhabitants of a city being seduced by wicked men into idolatry. In this case inquiry was to be made as to the fact; and if it was found to be so, the inhabitants of that city were to be put to the sword, all their property was to be burnt, and the city itself reduced to a heap; so should the anger of the Lord be averted from Israel, and he would do them good. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear in one of thy cities.</span> The Hebrew phrase, "to hear in" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>). has sometimes the meaning of to overhear, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-5.htm">Genesis 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>; sometimes it means simply to hear, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a> [35]; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>, it has the force of to hear of or concerning, though some think this questionable. This latter is apparently the meaning here: If thou <span class="accented">hear concerning any of thy cities</span>, etc. Baying. This introduces what is heard. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:12-18 Here is the case of a city revolting from the God of Israel, and serving other gods. The crime is supposed to be committed by one of the cities of Israel. Even when they were ordered to preserve their religion by force, yet they were not allowed to bring others to it by fire and sword. Spiritual judgments under the Christian dispensation are more terrible than the execution of criminals; we have not less cause than the Israelites had, to fear the Divine wrath. Let us then fear the spiritual idolatry of covetousness, and the love of worldly pleasure; and be careful not to countenance them in our families, by our example or by the education of our children. May the Lord write his law and truth in our hearts, there set up his throne, and shed abroad his love!</body></html>
