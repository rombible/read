This is the first place where the expression "sons of Belial" occurs, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-22.htm" title="Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him.">Judges 19:22</a> is the second. It is generally explained by modern scholars as "worthlessness." Rashi curiously makes it "destroyers of the yoke" (of Jehovah).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Men, the children of Belial</span>; the <span class="accented">sons of worthlessness</span>, utterly worthless persons. <span class="accented">Beli ya'al</span> (a compound of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, not, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>, to ascend, to have worth, to profit) means primarily that which is low, hence worthlessness, naughtiness, wickedness. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>, Belial is rendered in the Authorized Version as an adjective, "wicked," and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>, it is rendered by "ungodly men." Most commonly it is treated as a proper name. But in all places the proper meaning of the word might be retained. The Hebrews described an object, of which any quality was predominantly characteristic, as the son of that quality. <span class="cmt_word">Are gone out from among you</span>; have gone forth from the midst of you, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. have risen up among yourselves. <span class="cmt_word">Withdraw</span>. The verb here is the same as that rendered by "thrust," in vers. 5 and 10. It conveys the idea of drawing away with some degree of force, not mere easy seduction, but impulsion by strong persuasion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:12-18 Here is the case of a city revolting from the God of Israel, and serving other gods. The crime is supposed to be committed by one of the cities of Israel. Even when they were ordered to preserve their religion by force, yet they were not allowed to bring others to it by fire and sword. Spiritual judgments under the Christian dispensation are more terrible than the execution of criminals; we have not less cause than the Israelites had, to fear the Divine wrath. Let us then fear the spiritual idolatry of covetousness, and the love of worldly pleasure; and be careful not to countenance them in our families, by our example or by the education of our children. May the Lord write his law and truth in our hearts, there set up his throne, and shed abroad his love!</body></html>
