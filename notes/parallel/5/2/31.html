Sihon initiated hostilities by coming out with all his host to fight against Moses and the Israelites. The battle took place at Jahaz (or Jahazah, or Jahza), a town between Medeba and Dibon (Euseb.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-45.htm">Numbers 33:45</a>), afterwards belonging to the tribe of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>), and assigned to the Levites of the line of Merari (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-36.htm">Joshua 21:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-78.htm">1 Chronicles 6:78</a>). The war was one of extermination, in which all the people of Sihon were destroyed, from one cad of his dominion to the other; all his cities were devoted irredeemably (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>), and only the cattle and the material property were preserved as booty by the conquerors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23-26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:24-37 God tried his people, by forbidding them to meddle with the rich countries of Moab and Ammon. He gives them possession of the country of the Amorites. If we keep from what God forbids, we shall not lose by our obedience. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; and he gives it to whom he pleases; but when there is no express direction, none can plead his grant for such proceedings. Though God assured the Israelites that the land should be their own, yet they must contend with the enemy. What God gives we must endeavour to get. What a new world did Israel now come into! Much more joyful will the change be, which holy souls will experience, when they remove out of the wilderness of this world to the better country, that is, the heavenly, to the city that has foundations. Let us, by reflecting upon God's dealings with his people Israel, be led to meditate upon our years spent in vanity, through our transgressions. But happy are those whom Jesus has delivered from the wrath to come. To whom he hath given the earnest of his Spirit in their hearts. Their inheritance cannot be affected by revolutions of kingdoms, or changes in earthly possessions.</body></html>
