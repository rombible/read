The phrase "city of men" can hardly mean, as Rosenm&uuml;ller affirms, "men of a city;" the hypallage here would be too violent. It rather means "a peopled city," "a city inhabited by men." The word rendered "men" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) does not designate males as opposed to females, but is a designation of human beings in general (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-3.htm">Job 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> [Hebrews 20:48]; 31:31; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a>, "vain persons," Authorized Version, literally, <span class="accented">men of emptiness</span> or <span class="accented">of falsehood</span>, etc.). The passage might be rendered, <span class="accented">every inhabited city</span>, <span class="accented">even the women and the little children</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:24-37 God tried his people, by forbidding them to meddle with the rich countries of Moab and Ammon. He gives them possession of the country of the Amorites. If we keep from what God forbids, we shall not lose by our obedience. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; and he gives it to whom he pleases; but when there is no express direction, none can plead his grant for such proceedings. Though God assured the Israelites that the land should be their own, yet they must contend with the enemy. What God gives we must endeavour to get. What a new world did Israel now come into! Much more joyful will the change be, which holy souls will experience, when they remove out of the wilderness of this world to the better country, that is, the heavenly, to the city that has foundations. Let us, by reflecting upon God's dealings with his people Israel, be led to meditate upon our years spent in vanity, through our transgressions. But happy are those whom Jesus has delivered from the wrath to come. To whom he hath given the earnest of his Spirit in their hearts. Their inheritance cannot be affected by revolutions of kingdoms, or changes in earthly possessions.</body></html>
