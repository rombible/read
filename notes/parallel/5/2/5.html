Accordingly, they were enjoined to buy from them for money food and water as they required. Two different words in the Hebrew are rendered here by "buy" in the Authorized Version; the former, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, grain, properly means to deal in grain, whether as buyer or seller, and so to buy food; the latter, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, means primarily to dig (a well, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>), and, as used here, probably conveys the idea that the Israelites were to pay for permission to dig wells in the country of the Edomites to supply themselves with water as they passed along; this, however, does not necessarily follow from the use of this word, for it has also the meaning to buy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>, and the corresponding Arabic verb, <span class="accented">kara</span>, which in certain conjugations has the meaning to borrow or hire). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 Only a short account of the long stay of Israel in the wilderness is given. God not only chastised them for their murmuring and unbelief, but prepared them for Canaan; by humbling them for sin, teaching them to mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves in him. Though Israel may be long kept waiting for deliverance and enlargement, it will come at last. Before God brought Israel to destroy their enemies in Canaan, he taught them to forgive their enemies in Edom. They must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct, think to seize all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not founded in grace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not expect to be placed alone in the midst of the earth. Religion must never be made a cloak for injustice. Scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou hast an all-sufficient God to depend upon. Use what thou hast, use it cheerfully. Thou hast experienced the care of the Divine providence, never use any crooked methods for thy supply. All this is equally to be applied to the experience of the believer.</body></html>
