Probably the valley was so named from the "willows of the brook" which grew there. But it was the "valley of pruning" to the "vine" which God had "brought out of Egypt" in another sense. The last of the fruitless branches was here taken away, and the vine "purged, that it might bring forth more fruit."<p><span class= "bld">Thirty and eight years; until all . . . men of war were wasted out from among the host.</span>--The census did not take place until some months later. A plague intervened, which cut off twenty-four thousand. The observation that at the brook Zered all the men of the older generation were "wasted out of the host" indicates an intimate knowledge of the incidents of the exodus. But it is quite natural to suppose that, as the survivors of that generation became fewer, those who remained would become marked men. Every man of the twelve tribes (excluding Levi? ) who passed the census at Sinai was doomed. The fortieth year of the exodus had more than half expired when they came to the brook Zered. All who remained alive in that year knew that they had a short time to live. Probably more notice was taken of the last few deaths than of all the rest of the six hundred thousand put together.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Men of war</span>; those of age sufficient to go forth to war, viz. twenty y. ears old and upwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>).

Moses also gives an instance older than any of these; the Caphtorims drove the Avims out of their country. These revolutions show what uncertain things wordly possessions are. It was so of old, and ever will be so. Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to families that increase; so little continuance is there in these things. This is recorded to encourage the children of Israel. If the providence of God has done this for Moabites and Ammonites, much more would his promise do it for Israel, his peculiar people. Cautions are given not to meddle with Moabites and Ammonites. Even wicked men must not be wronged. God gives and preserves outward blessings to wicked men; these are not the best things, he has better in store for his own children.</body></html>
