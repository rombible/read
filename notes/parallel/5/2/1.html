At this point the language of address is exchanged for that of narrative. The change of subject from "ye abode" to "we turned," became necessary when Moses passed from exhorting and warning the people to narrating what happened after they resumed their journeyings; and gives no support to the notion of some recent German critics, that Moses left Kadesh with only a portion of the people, while the rest remained there, so that no entire departure of Israel from Kadesh ever took place - a notion which the whole tenor of the subsequent narrative contradicts. In obedience to the Divine command (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40</a>), the people, after tarrying for a while at Kadesh, took their departure and marched in the direction of the Yam-suph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we compassed mount Seir many days.</span> These "many days" are the thirty-eight years during which the people wandered in the wilderness before they camped the second time at Kadesh; their going round Mount Seir, which was in Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8, 9, 20</a>), is descriptive of their nomadic wanderings in various directions, west, south, and south-east of that mountain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>). "Crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4, 5</a>), the Israelites issued into the great and elevated plains which are still traversed by the Syrian pilgrims on their way to Mecca; and appear to have followed <span class="accented">northward</span> nearly the same route which is now taken by the Syrian Hadgi along the western skirts of this great desert near the mountains of Edom" (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:253, 559). Mount Seir is now <span class="accented">Jebal</span> and <span class="accented">esh-Sherah</span>. This mountain range is a continuation of that which surrounds the eastern side of the Dead Sea. The details of this protracted wandering are passed over by Moses as not required by his purpose here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 Only a short account of the long stay of Israel in the wilderness is given. God not only chastised them for their murmuring and unbelief, but prepared them for Canaan; by humbling them for sin, teaching them to mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves in him. Though Israel may be long kept waiting for deliverance and enlargement, it will come at last. Before God brought Israel to destroy their enemies in Canaan, he taught them to forgive their enemies in Edom. They must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct, think to seize all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not founded in grace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not expect to be placed alone in the midst of the earth. Religion must never be made a cloak for injustice. Scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou hast an all-sufficient God to depend upon. Use what thou hast, use it cheerfully. Thou hast experienced the care of the Divine providence, never use any crooked methods for thy supply. All this is equally to be applied to the experience of the believer.</body></html>
