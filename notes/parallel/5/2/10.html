In Moab dwelt, in the earlier times, the Emim, a giant race, potent and numerous, like the 'Anakim. They were also, like the 'Anakim reckoned among the Rephaim, but were by the Moabites called Emim. The word <span class="cmt_word">Emim</span> means frightful, and was given to these men probably because of their huge stature and fierce aspect. <span class="cmt_word">Anakims</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>). <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> seems to have been a generic name of these gigantic Canaanitish tribes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Horim</span> appear from the name (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, a cave) to have been a Troglodyte race, inhabiting the caves which abound in the Edomite range, and with whom, perhaps, originated the conception which was at a later period carried out in the marvelous rock city of Petra. Of their own origin nothing is known. <span class="cmt_word">As Israel did</span> [or <span class="accented">has done</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto the land of his possession</span>. This cannot be regarded as uttered proleptically; it must either be the insertion of a later age, or it must refer to the conquest which had actually been made before this by the Israelites of the land to the east of the Jordan. and which is, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-20.htm">Deuteronomy 3:20</a>, described as the possession which the Lord had given to the two tribes and a half to whom it had been assigned. The latter is the preferable supposition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-23 We have the origin of the Moabites, Edomites, and Ammonites. Moses also gives an instance older than any of these; the Caphtorims drove the Avims out of their country. These revolutions show what uncertain things wordly possessions are. It was so of old, and ever will be so. Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to families that increase; so little continuance is there in these things. This is recorded to encourage the children of Israel. If the providence of God has done this for Moabites and Ammonites, much more would his promise do it for Israel, his peculiar people. Cautions are given not to meddle with Moabites and Ammonites. Even wicked men must not be wronged. God gives and preserves outward blessings to wicked men; these are not the best things, he has better in store for his own children.</body></html>
