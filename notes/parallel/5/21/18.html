It appears in the Revised <span class= "ital">New </span>Testament, in the margin of St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>, for "thou fool." But the Greek word there employed is true Greek, and has its own affinities in the New Testament. And the word <span class= "ital">moreh </span>is true Hebrew. They may be idiomatically synonymous. They are not etymologically identical.<p><span class= "bld">A glutton and a drunkard.</span>--The same two words are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/23-20.htm" title="Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:">Proverbs 23:20-22</a>, "Be not among wine <span class= "ital">bibbers; </span>among <span class= "ital">riotous eaters </span>of flesh: For the <span class= "ital">drunkard </span>and the <span class= "ital">glutton </span>shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. Hearken unto thy father that begat thee; and despise not thy mother when she is old." The context of this quotation seems to make it a distinct reference to the law in Deuteronomy 21<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Shall stone him with stones.</span>--Rashi says that the Law cuts short the man's career, anticipating what its close will be. When he has spent all his father's money, he will take to the road, and become a public robber. It is better that he die innocent of such crimes than guilty. We can hardly adopt this view of the case; but it contains one feature that is terribly true.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-21.</span> - If a son was refractory and unmanageable by his parents, if, given to sensual indulgence, he would yield neither to reproof nor to chastisement, - the parents were to lay hold on him, and lead him to the elders of the town, sitting as magistrates at its gates, and there accuse him of his evil ways and rebelliousness. The testimony of the parents was apparently held sufficient to substantiate the charge, and this being received by the elders, the culprit was to be put to death by stoning. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:18-21 Observe how the criminal is here described. He is a stubborn and rebellious son. No child was to fare the worse for weakness of capacity, slowness, or dulness, but for wilfulness and obstinacy. Nothing draws men into all manner of wickedness, and hardens them in it more certainly and fatally, than drunkenness. When men take to drinking, they forget the law of honouring parents. His own father and mother must complain of him to the elders of the city. Children who forget their duty, must thank themselves, and not blame their parents, if they are regarded with less and less affection. He must be publicly stoned to death by the men of his city. Disobedience to a parent's authority must be very evil, when such a punishment was ordered; nor is it less provoking to God now, though it escapes punishment in this world. But when young people early become slaves to sensual appetites, the heart soon grows hard, and the conscience callous; and we can expect nothing but rebellion and destruction.</body></html>
