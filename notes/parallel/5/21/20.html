he is a glutton, and a drunkard. Gluttony and drunkenness were regarded by the Hebrews as highly criminal. The word rendered by "glutton," however (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, to shake, to shake out, to squander), includes other kinds of excess besides eating. It designates one who is prodigal, who wastes his means or wastes his person by indulgence. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-30.htm">Proverbs 23:30</a>, the whole phrase (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) is given - squanderers of flesh, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. wasters of their own body, debauchees. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-7.htm">Proverbs 28:7</a>, the word is translated "riotous men" in the Authorized Version. Disobedience to parents was deemed an offense, which struck at the roots of the whole social institute. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:18-21 Observe how the criminal is here described. He is a stubborn and rebellious son. No child was to fare the worse for weakness of capacity, slowness, or dulness, but for wilfulness and obstinacy. Nothing draws men into all manner of wickedness, and hardens them in it more certainly and fatally, than drunkenness. When men take to drinking, they forget the law of honouring parents. His own father and mother must complain of him to the elders of the city. Children who forget their duty, must thank themselves, and not blame their parents, if they are regarded with less and less affection. He must be publicly stoned to death by the men of his city. Disobedience to a parent's authority must be very evil, when such a punishment was ordered; nor is it less provoking to God now, though it escapes punishment in this world. But when young people early become slaves to sensual appetites, the heart soon grows hard, and the conscience callous; and we can expect nothing but rebellion and destruction.</body></html>
