We cannot see why he should be pronounced cursed, except for the sake of that which was designed by "the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God," that His Son Jesus Christ should bear our sins in His own body on the tree, and redeem us from the curse of the Law, by being "made a curse for us."<p>Rashi's note upon this shows how strangely the rays of truth are sometimes refracted in the Jewish mina: "'He that is hanged is the curse of God'--that is, he is <span class= "ital">the King's disgrace. </span>For man was made in the likeness of His image. And Israel are his children. There were two twin brothers, who were much alike. One was made king, the other was taken up for highway robbery, and was hanged. Every one who saw him said, 'There hangs the king!'" From this note it is clear that Rashi takes the words to mean, "He that is hanged is <span class= "ital">God's disgrace," </span>because man is "made after the similitude of God." There is no doubt as to the <span class= "ital">shame </span>of the punishment which our Lord endured and despised.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt in any wise bury him that day.</span>--Another law, remarkably and providentially fulfilled in our Lord's death. We do not read that the robbers who were crucified with Him were buried, though their bodies were removed from the cross. It is not improbable that this law was also intended to prevent the barbarous practice of leaving men impaled op sharp stakes or suspended upon crosses from day to day until they died of pain and thirst. It certainly is a disgrace to the Divine image to treat it thus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - When a criminal was put to death and was hanged upon a tree, his body was not to remain there over-night, but was to be buried the same day on which he was executed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man have committed a sin worthy of death</span>; literally, <span class="accented">If there be on a man a judgment of death</span>; if he lie under sentence of death. <span class="cmt_word">Hang him on a tree.</span> This refers not to putting to death by strangling, but to the impaling of the body after death (cf. C. B. Michaelis, 'De Judiciis Poenisque Capitalibus in Sac. Script. Commemoratis,' in 'Sylloge Commentt. Theolog.,' edita a D. J. Pott, vol. 4. p. 209). This was an aggravation of the punishment, as the body so impaled was exposed to insult and assault (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-19.htm">Genesis 40:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:22,23 By the law of Moses, the touch of a dead body was defiling, therefore dead bodies must not be left hanging, as that would defile the land. There is one reason here which has reference to Christ; He that is hanged is accursed of God; that is, it is the highest degree of disgrace and reproach. Those who see a man thus hanging between heaven and earth, will conclude him abandoned of both, and unworthy of either. Moses, by the Spirit, uses this phrase of being accursed of God, when he means no more than being treated most disgracefully, that it might afterward be applied to the death of Christ, and might show that in it he underwent the curse of the law for us; which proves his love, and encourages to faith in him.</body></html>
