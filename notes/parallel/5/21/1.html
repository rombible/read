Some have thought that the valley was neither to be eared (ploughed) nor sown from that time forward." The verbs are not past in the Hebrew, and the words <span class= "ital">may </span>bear this meaning. If so, the district in which the murder occurred would be mulcted in that portion of land for ever.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">And the priests.</span>--See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-8.htm" title="Be merciful, O LORD, to your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and lay not innocent blood to your people of Israel's charge.

The sacrifices are a "covering" for the sinner from a punishment of sin. According to Rashi, the prayer in the eighth verse is spoken by the priests; and it seems probable enough. No part in the transaction is assigned to them, unless it be this. And their presence was certainly necessary.<p><span class= "bld">And the blood shall be forgiven them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">shall be covered for them. </span>Not the same expression as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-20.htm" title="And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.">Leviticus 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-31.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell to the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-35.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:35</a>. But we can hardly follow the Jewish commentators into the question whether, if the perpetrator of the murder were afterwards discovered, the blood of the heifer which had been shed already could be allowed to atone for it, so that the murderer need not be punished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - If a body was found lying dead from a wound, and it was not known by whom the wound had been inflicted, the whole land would be involved in the guilt of the murder, unless it was duly expiated as here directed. First, the elders and judges (presumably of the neighboring towns; of Josephus, 'Antiq.' 4:8, 16) were to meet, the former as magistrates representing the communities, the latter as administrators of the law, and were to measure the distance from the body of the slain man to each of the surrounding towns, in order to ascertain which was the nearest. This ascertained, upon that town was to be laid the duty of expiating the crime. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 If a murderer could not be found out, great solemnity is provided for putting away the guilt from the land, as an expression of dread and detesting of that sin. The providence of God has often wonderfully brought to light these hidden works of darkness, and the sin of the guilty has often strangely found them out. The dread of murder should be deeply impressed upon every heart, and all should join in detecting and punishing those who are guilty. The elders were to profess that they had not been any way aiding or abetting the sin. The priests were to pray to God for the country and nation, that God would be merciful. We must empty that measure by our prayers, which others are filling by their sins. All would be taught by this solemnity, to use the utmost care and diligence to prevent, discover, and punish murder. We may all learn from hence to take heed of partaking in other men's sins. And we have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, if we do not reprove them.</body></html>
