literally, a <span class="accented">stream of perpetuity</span>, a perennial stream (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a>, Authorized Version, "mighty rivers;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>); but here rather the valley or wady through which a stream flowed, as is evident from its being described as <span class="cmt_word">neither eared</span> - that is, ploughed (literally, <span class="accented">wrought</span>, <span class="accented">tilled</span>) <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>nor sown</span>; a place which had not been profaned by the hand of man, but was in a state of nature. "This regulation as to the locality in which the act of expiation was to be performed was probably founded on the idea that the water of the brook-valley would suck in the blood and clean it away, and that the blood sucked in by the earth would not be brought to light again by the ploughing and working of the soil" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley</span>; rather, <span class="accented">break the heifer's neck</span>. As this was not an act of sacrifice, for which the shedding of blood would have been required, but simply a symbolical representation of the infliction of death on the undiscovered murderer, the animal was to be killed by breaking its neck (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 If a murderer could not be found out, great solemnity is provided for putting away the guilt from the land, as an expression of dread and detesting of that sin. The providence of God has often wonderfully brought to light these hidden works of darkness, and the sin of the guilty has often strangely found them out. The dread of murder should be deeply impressed upon every heart, and all should join in detecting and punishing those who are guilty. The elders were to profess that they had not been any way aiding or abetting the sin. The priests were to pray to God for the country and nation, that God would be merciful. We must empty that measure by our prayers, which others are filling by their sins. All would be taught by this solemnity, to use the utmost care and diligence to prevent, discover, and punish murder. We may all learn from hence to take heed of partaking in other men's sins. And we have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, if we do not reprove them.</body></html>
