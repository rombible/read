Whilst the people were in the wilderness, united as one body and under the leadership of Moses, this arrangement was sufficient; but a more extended arrangement would be required when they came to be settled in Canaan and dispersed in towns and villages over the whole land. In prospect of this, Moses here enacts that judges and officers were to be appointed by the people in all their gates, in all their places of residence, which the Lord should give them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judges and officers.</span> The "officers" (<span class="accented">shoterim</span>, writers) associated with the judges both in the earlier arrangements and in that which was to succeed were secretaries and clerks of court, and acted also as assessors and advisers of the judges. No instruction is given as to the number of judges and officers, or as to the mode of appointing them; nor was this necessary. The former would be determined by the size and population of the place where they were appointed, and the latter would, as a matter of course, follow the method instituted by Moses in the earlier arrangement (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:18-22 Care is taken for the due administration of justice.

Nothing belies God more, or tends more to corrupt the minds of men, than representing and worshipping, by an image, that God, who is an almighty and eternal Spirit, present every where. Alas! even in gospel days, and under a better dispensation, established upon better promises, there is a tendency to set up idols, under one form or another, in the human heart.</body></html>
