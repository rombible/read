On the persons who are to share the joy, Rashi has an interesting note. "The Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,--My four (Jehovah's), over against thy four--thy son, thy daughter, thy manservant, thy maidservant. If thou wilt make My four to rejoice, I will rejoice thy four."<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Seven days.</span>--An eighth day is mentioned both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm" title="Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-35.htm" title="On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly: you shall do no servile work therein:">Numbers 29:35</a>. But the seven days of this feast are also spoken of in both those passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm" title="Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:">Numbers 29:12</a>). There is, therefore, no contradiction between the two passages. The eighth day is treated apart from the first seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles, somewhat in the same way as the Passover is always distinguished in the Pentateuch from the six days which followed it, and which are called the Feast of Unleavened bread. The reason for the distinction in that case becomes clear in the fulfilment of the feast by our Lord. The Passover is <span class= "ital">His sacrifice and death. We keep </span>the feast of <span class= "ital">unleavened </span>bread by serving Him in "<span class= "ital">sincerity and truth." </span>The Feast of Tabernacles has not yet been fulfilled by our Lord like the two other great feasts of the Jewish calendar. Unfulfilled prophecies regarding it may be pointed out, as in Zechariah 14. Our Lord refused to signalise that feast by any public manifestation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2-10</a>). There may, therefore, be some reason for separating the eighth and last day of the Feast of Tabernacles from the former seven, which will appear in its fulfilment in the kingdom of God. It is remarkable that the dedication of Solomon's temple, the commencement of the second temple and the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, all occurred about the time of the Feast of Tabernacles.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt surely rejoice.</span>--In the Hebrew this is a somewhat unusual form of expression. Literally, <span class= "ital">thou wilt be only rejoicing. </span>Rashi says it is not a command, but a promise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - The <span class="accented">Feast of Tabernacles</span>, properly, <span class="accented">Booths</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-38</a>). This feast was to be observed at the end of harvest, after the corn had been gathered into granaries, and the produce of the vineyard had been put through the press. Nothing is added here to the instructions already given respecting this festival; only the observance of it at the appointed sanctuary is enforced, and stress is laid on their making not only their sons and daughters and domestics, but also the Levite, the fatherless, the widow, and the stranger participators in their rejoicings. Thou shalt surely rejoice; rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt be wholly joyous</span>; literally, <span class="accented">rejoicing only</span>; Rosenm., "<span class="accented">adnodum laetus</span>." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-17 The laws for the three yearly feasts are here repeated; that of the Passover, that of the Pentecost, that of Tabernacles; and the general law concerning the people's attendance. Never should a believer forget his low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price it cost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingled with sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way to the kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God, and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be our delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the law must rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of the gospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the Lord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we can to assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners, and supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, may rejoice in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.</body></html>
