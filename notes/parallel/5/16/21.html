The asherah was an idol of wood in the form of a pillar, usually placed by the side of the altars of Baal. It was the symbol of Astarte, the great Canaanitish goddess, the companion and revealer of Baal. The two are usually associated in the Old Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>). The rendering "grove" has been taken from the LXX. and the Vulgate; but that it is an error is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>; where the asherah is said to be <span class="accented">under</span> a green tree; and from the use of such words as <span class="accented">make</span>, <span class="accented">set up</span>, <span class="accented">cause to stand</span>, <span class="accented">build</span>, to denote the action of producing an asherah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-15.htm">1 Kings 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-33.htm">1 Kings 16:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-19.htm">2 Chronicles 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>), none of which are appropriate to the planting of a grove. Here, indeed, the word "plant" is used, but this is only because, as the asherah was sunk in the earth that it might stand firm, it might be figuratively said to be planted, just as nails driven in are said to be planted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>, where the same verb is used; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-15.htm">Amos 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:18-22 Care is taken for the due administration of justice. All personal regards must be laid aside, so that right is done to all, and wrong to none. Care is taken to prevent following the idolatrous customs of the heathen. Nothing belies God more, or tends more to corrupt the minds of men, than representing and worshipping, by an image, that God, who is an almighty and eternal Spirit, present every where. Alas! even in gospel days, and under a better dispensation, established upon better promises, there is a tendency to set up idols, under one form or another, in the human heart.</body></html>
