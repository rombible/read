nothing was specially prescribed, each was to give of his own free-will as the Lord had prospered him. The word translated "tribute" in the Authorized Version (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) occurs only here, and is of doubtful signification. The LXX. render it by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span>, as, according to; it is identical with the Aramaic <span class="aramaic">&#x5de;&#x5e1;&#x5ea;</span> sufficiency, enough, and may be understood here of the full measure according to which their offerings were to be presented. The freewill offering of thine hand, here referred to, belonged to the gifts of burnt offerings, meat offerings, drink offerings, and thank offerings which might be offered at every feast along with the sacrifices prescribed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-38.htm">Leviticus 23:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-39.htm">Numbers 29:39</a>). Of the latter no mention is made here, as the law regarding them was already sufficiently proclaimed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>, and 29.); and in a popular address it was rather to what depended on the will of the people than to what was imperative by law, that attention had to be directed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-17 The laws for the three yearly feasts are here repeated; that of the Passover, that of the Pentecost, that of Tabernacles; and the general law concerning the people's attendance. Never should a believer forget his low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price it cost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingled with sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way to the kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God, and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be our delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the law must rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of the gospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the Lord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we can to assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners, and supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, may rejoice in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.</body></html>
