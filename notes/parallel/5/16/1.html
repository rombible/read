(See on Exodus 12)<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The month Abib</span> was so called from the "ears of corn" which appeared in it.<p><span class= "bld">By night</span>.--Pharaoh's permission was given on the night of the death of the first-born, though Israel did not actually depart until the next day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-3.htm" title="And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.">Numbers 33:3-4</a>).<p>(2) <span class= "bld">Of the flock, and of the herd.</span>--The Passover victim itself must be either lamb or kid. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-4.htm" title="These are the beasts which you shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,">Deuteronomy 14:4</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm" title="Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:">Exodus 12:5</a>.) But there were special sacrifices of bullocks appointed for the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which followed the Passover. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-19.htm" title="But you shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be to you without blemish:">Numbers 28:19</a>.)<p>(6) <span class= "bld">At even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou comest forth from Egypt.</span>--The word "season" here is ambiguous in the English. Does it mean the time of year, or the time of day? The Hebrew word, which usually denotes a <span class= "ital">commemorative </span>time, might seem to point to the hour of sunset as the time when the march actually began. If so, it was the evening of the fifteenth day of the month (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm" title="And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.">Numbers 33:3</a>). But the word is also used generally of the time of year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm" title="You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it you came out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)">Exodus 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-2.htm" title="Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.">Numbers 9:2</a>, &c.); and as the Passover was to be kept on the fourteenth, not the fifteenth day, the time actually commemorated is the time of the slaying of the lamb which saved Israel from the destroyer, rather than the time of the actual march. It is noticeable that, while the Passover commemorated the deliverance by the slain lamb in Egypt, the Feast of Tabernacles commemorated the encampment at Succoth, the first resting-place of the delivered nation after the exodus had actually begun.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">A solemn assembly.</span>--Literally, as in the Margin, <span class= "ital">a restraint--i.e., </span>a day when work was forbidden. The word is applied to the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm" title="Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:36</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-35.htm" title="On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly: you shall do no servile work therein:">Numbers 29:35</a>, and does not occur elsewhere in the Pentateuch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The month of Abib</span> (cf. Exodus 41:2; 23. 15). The time is referred to as a date well known to the people. <span class="cmt_word">Keep the passover</span>; <span class="accented">make</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;</span>) <span class="accented">or prepare the passover</span>. This injunction refers primarily to the preparation of the Paschal lamb for a festal meal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-5.htm">Numbers 9:5</a>); but here it is used in a wider sense as referring to the whole Paschal observance, which lasted for seven days. Hence the mention of sheep (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>) and oxen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) in ver. 2, and the reference to the eating of unleavened bread for seven days "therewith," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with the Passover. The animal for the Paschal supper was expressly prescribed to be a yearling of the sheep or of the goats (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), and this was to be consumed at one meal; but on the other days of the festival the flesh of other animals offered in sacrifice might be eaten. The term "Passover" here, accordingly, embraces the whole of the festive meals connected with the Passover proper - what the rabbins call <span class="accented">chagigah</span> (Maimon., in 'Kor-ban Pesach,' c. 10. &sect; 12; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-17 The laws for the three yearly feasts are here repeated; that of the Passover, that of the Pentecost, that of Tabernacles; and the general law concerning the people's attendance. Never should a believer forget his low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price it cost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingled with sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way to the kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God, and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be our delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the law must rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of the gospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the Lord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we can to assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners, and supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, may rejoice in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.</body></html>
