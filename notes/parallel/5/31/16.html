It is one of the many proofs in Holy Scripture that our Creator is not like the man in our Lord's parable, who "intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first and counteth the cost, whether he hath sufficient to finish it." When He chose Israel to be His people, He knew the risk of doing so, and He provided for it beforehand. Not less when He said, "Let us make man in our image, <span class= "ital">after our likeness," </span>did He provide the means of forming in us the Divine character by all that Christ has done. The fall is recorded in the third chapter of Genesis. Redemption and restoration are exhibited in type and symbol in the second chapter. God brought Israel into Canaan in full foreknowledge of what the people would become when there.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">And break my covenant.</span>--With this, contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Judges 2:1</a> : "I said, <span class= "ital">I will never break my covenant </span>with you."

Moses is told again that he must shortly die; even those who are most ready and willing to die, need to be often reminded of its coming. The Lord tells Moses, that, after his death, the covenant he had taken so much pains to make between Israel and their God, would certainly be broken. Israel would forsake Him; then God would forsake Israel. Justly does he cast those off who so unjustly cast him off. Moses is directed to deliver them a song, which should remain a standing testimony for God, as faithful to them in giving them warning, and against them, as persons false to themselves in not taking the warning. The word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of men's hearts, and meets them by reproofs and correction. Ministers who preach the word, know not the imaginations of men; but God, whose word it is, knows perfectly.</body></html>
