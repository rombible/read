The deliverance here must be understood as a charge and a trust conveyed to the priests, making them responsible for the "reading of the law," and for the instruction of the people. This is the special duty of the priests. They are said to "bear" the ark of the covenant here; not because they always carried it (they did sometimes, as in Joshua 3), but because they were responsible for it, just as they were also responsible for the exposition of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-9.htm" title="And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment:">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>).

It is in this connection that the story is told of Agrippa that he wept when he came to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-15.htm" title="You shall in any wise set him king over you, whom the LORD your God shall choose: one from among your brothers shall you set king over you: you may not set a stranger over you, which is not your brother.">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>, "Thou mayest not set a stranger over thee." But they said, "Fear not, Agrippa, thou art our brother," and he then finished the reading. It was read from a platform erected in the forecourt of the temple. From this passage it is clear that the "reading" was understood to refer specially to the book of Deuteronomy.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">That their children . . . may hear.</span>--It is obvious from this that the existence of many copies of the law was not contemplated by the writer. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/6-6.htm" title="And these words, which I command you this day, shall be in your heart:">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a> : "These words shall be <span class= "ital">in thine heart, </span>and thou <span class= "ital">shalt teach them."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-13.</span> - Moses turns next to the priests and the elders, and to them he commits the Law which he had written, with the injunction to read it to the people at the end of every seven years during the festival of the year of release, viz. at the Feast of Tabernacles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>), when they appeared before the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">At the end of every seven years</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-1.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1</a>). The Law was committed to the priests and elders, not merely to preserve it in safe keeping, but that they might see to its being observed by the people; else why commit it to the elders whose it was to administer rule in the nation, as well as <span class="accented">to</span> the priests who alone had access to the ark of the covenant where the Law was deposited? Moses "entrusted the reading to the priesthood and the college of elders, as the spiritual and secular rulers of the congregation; and hence the singular, Thou shalt read this Law to all Israel" (Keil). By the Law here is meant the Pentateuch; but it does not necessarily follow that the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the Pentateuch was to be thus read. As the reading was to be only once in seven years, it may be concluded that it was not so much for the information of the people that this was done, as for the purpose of publicly declaring, and by a solemn ceremony impressing on their minds the condition on which they held their position and privileges as the chosen people of the Lord; and for this the reading of select portions of the Torah would be sufficient. The Feast of Tabernacles was appointed as the season for the reading, <span class="accented">doubtless</span> because <span class="accented">there</span> was a <span class="accented">connection</span> between the end for which the Law was read and the spirit and meaning of that festival as a festival of rejoicing because of their deliverance from the uncertainty and unsettledness of their state in the wilderness, and their establishment in a well-ordered state where they could in peace and quietness enjoy the blessings which the bounty of God bestowed. <span class="cmt_word">When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt read this law</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-34.htm">Joshua 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:9-13 Though we read the word in private, we must not think it needless to hear it read in public. This solemn reading of the law must be done in the year of release. The year of release was typical of gospel grace, which is called the acceptable year of the Lord; for our pardon and liberty by Christ, engage us to keep his commandments. It must be read to all Israel, men, women, children, and to the strangers. It is the will of God that all people should acquaint themselves with his word. It is a rule to all, therefore should be read to all. Whoever has read of the pains taken by many persons to get scraps of the Scriptures, when a whole copy could not be obtained, or safely possessed, will see how thankful we should be for the thousands of copies amongst us. They will also understand the very different situation in which the Israelites were placed for many ages. But the heart of man is so careless, that all will be found too little, to keep up a knowledge of the truths, precepts, and worship of God.</body></html>
