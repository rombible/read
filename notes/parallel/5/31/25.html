According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, etc., it was the Kohathites who carried the ark on the journey through the desert; but they seem merely to have acted in this respect as the servants or helpers of the priests, who alone might touch the ark, and by whom it was carefully wrapped up before it was handed to the Kohathites. On special occasions the priests themselves carried the ark (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a>, etc.; Joshua 4:9, 10; 6:6, 12; 8:33; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:23-30 The solemn delivery of the book of the law to the Levites, to be deposited in, or rather by the side, of the ark, is again related. The song which follows in the next chapter is delivered to Moses, and by him to the people. He wrote it first, as the Holy Spirit taught him; and then spake it in the hearing of all the people. Moses tells them plainly, I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves. Many a sad thought, no doubt, it occasioned to this good man; but his comfort was, that he had done his duty, and that God would be glorified in their dispersion, if not in their settlement, for the foundation of God stands sure.</body></html>
