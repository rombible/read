Possibly it means "went on to speak." The Palestine Targum has, "He went into the house of instruction and spake." The LXX. have apparently preserved a different reading, and say, "And Moses made an end of speaking these words" (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-45.htm" title="And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:">Deuteronomy 32:45</a>), as if the Hebrew were <span class= "ital">vay'cal </span>instead of <span class= "ital">vay-yelek. </span>A transposition of two letters would make all the difference.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in.</span>--The description of Moses' death in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-7.htm" title="And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>, says, "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated." Yet he may have felt within himself that his work was done. "I have no longer authority, for the authority is taken from me and given into the hand of Joshua" is one interpretation. And it suits with what follows. "The Lord hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan."<p>(3) <span class= "bld">The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee . . . Joshua, he shall go over before thee.</span>--Can it be accidental that Jehovah and Joshua are spoken of in exactly the same language, and that there is no distinguishing conjunction between them, the "and" of the English Version being supplied? "Jehovah, He is going over; Joshua, he is going over." Verbally, the two are as much identified as "The God who fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel that redeemed me from all evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/48-15.htm" title="And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long to this day,">Genesis 48:15-16</a>). The prophetical truth of this identification is too remarkable to be missed.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">As he did to Sihon and to Og.</span>--The value of these two conquests, before Israel passed the Jordan, was inestimable, as an encouragement to them to persevere.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">According unto all the commandments.</span>--The Hebrew word for "commandments" is in the singular, <span class= "ital">Mitzvah, </span>the principle of action.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid.</span>--Here this is addressed to the people in the plural number. The same thing is said to Joshua in the next verse.<p>(7, 8) <span class= "bld">And Moses called unto Joshua.</span>--In these words Moses formally delivers the charge of the people to Joshua, to lead them over Jordan.<p><span class= "bld">He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee.</span>--Repeated by Jehovah Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-5.htm" title="There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail you, nor forsake you.">Joshua 1:5</a>). "Will not let thee go" is the exact meaning of "fail" here. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm" title="Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>, "let me alone."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses went</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. disposed or set himself. The meaning is not that he "went away" into the tent of teaching, as one of the Targums explains it (London Polyglot, tom. 4. p. 377), which does not agree with what follows; nor is "went" merely equivalent to "moreover;" nor is it simply redundant; - it intimates that the speaking was consequent on Moses having arranged, disposed, or set himself to speak (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-8 Moses assures Israel of the constant presence of God with them. This is applied by the apostle to all God's spiritual Israel, to encourage their faith and hope; unto us is this gospel preached, as well as unto them; he will never fail thee, nor forsake thee, Heb 13:5. Moses commends Joshua to them for a leader; one whose wisdom, and courage, and affection they had long known; one whom God had appointed to be their leader; and therefore would own and bless. Joshua is well pleased to be admonished by Moses to be strong and of good courage. Those shall speed well, who have God with them; therefore they ought to be of good courage. Through God let us do valiantly, for through him we shall do victoriously; if we resist the devil, he will flee from us.</body></html>
