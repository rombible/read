since then forty years had elapsed during the wanderings in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">I can no more go out and come in</span>; I am no longer able to work among and for the nation as I have hitherto done (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>). This does not conflict with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>, that up to the time of his death his eyes were not dim nor his natural strength abated, for this is the statement of an observer, and it often happens that an individual feels himself to be failing, when to those around him he appears to possess unabated vigor. There is no need, therefore, for resorting, with Raschi and others, to the expedient of reading "for" instead of "and" in the following clause; as if the cause why Moses could no longer go in and out among the people was God's prohibition of his going over Jordan. This is simply another and collateral reason why he had now to retire flora his post as leader. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-8 Moses assures Israel of the constant presence of God with them. This is applied by the apostle to all God's spiritual Israel, to encourage their faith and hope; unto us is this gospel preached, as well as unto them; he will never fail thee, nor forsake thee, Heb 13:5. Moses commends Joshua to them for a leader; one whose wisdom, and courage, and affection they had long known; one whom God had appointed to be their leader; and therefore would own and bless. Joshua is well pleased to be admonished by Moses to be strong and of good courage. Those shall speed well, who have God with them; therefore they ought to be of good courage. Through God let us do valiantly, for through him we shall do victoriously; if we resist the devil, he will flee from us.</body></html>
