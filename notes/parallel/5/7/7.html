Abraham had twelve grandsons through Ishmael, but only the same number of <span class= "ital">great </span>grandsons through Isaac and Jacob. Edom, Moab, and Ammon all preceded Israel in the conquest of territory. Kings reigned in Edom "before there reigned any king over the children of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-31.htm" title="And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.">Genesis 36:31</a>). It was only "when the time of the promise drew nigh" that "the (chosen) people grew and multiplied in Egypt." The Scripture is throughout consistent in representing their development as due to the special providence of God.

It might have been supposed that, in choosing a people to be his special treasure, the Almighty would have selected some one of the great nations of the world; but, instead of that, he had chosen one of the smallest. They had, indeed, grown till now they were as the stars for multitude; but it was not in prospect of this that they were chosen. The election of Israel was purely of grace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-11 Here is a strict caution against all friendship and fellowship with idols and idolaters. Those who are in communion with God, must have no communication with the unfruitful works of darkness. Limiting the orders to destroy, to the nations here mentioned, plainly shows that after ages were not to draw this into a precedent. A proper understanding of the evil of sin, and of the mystery of a crucified Saviour, will enable us to perceive the justice of God in all his punishments, temporal and eternal. We must deal decidedly with our lusts that war against our souls; let us not show them any mercy, but mortify, and crucify, and utterly destroy them. Thousands in the world that now is, have been undone by ungodly marriages; for there is more likelihood that the good will be perverted, than that the bad will be converted. Those who, in choosing yoke-fellows, keep not within the bounds of a profession of religion, cannot promise themselves helps meet for them.</body></html>
