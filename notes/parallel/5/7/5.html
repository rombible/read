Sometimes the word is used for the image.<p><span class= "bld">Burn their graven images with fire.</span>--David treated the images of the Philistines thus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-12.htm" title="And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.">1Chronicles 14:12</a>). Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-19.htm" title="And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.">Isaiah 37:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-8.</span> - They were not only to have no fellowship with the idolaters, but they were to root out their idolatry, everting their altars and destroying their idols; and this because they were a holy people, graciously chosen of God to be his special possession - a high privilege and honor which they were to be careful not to cast away. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cut down their groves</span>; rather, <span class="accented">cut</span> or <span class="accented">hew in pieces their asherahs</span>. These were, apparently, wooden pillars of considerable height, which were firmly planted in the ground (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>)? and were consecrated to the worship of a female deity, the companion of Baal; probably the same as that after-war, is known as Astarte, the Venus of the Syrians (see note on Deuteronomy 16:21). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-11 Here is a strict caution against all friendship and fellowship with idols and idolaters. Those who are in communion with God, must have no communication with the unfruitful works of darkness. Limiting the orders to destroy, to the nations here mentioned, plainly shows that after ages were not to draw this into a precedent. A proper understanding of the evil of sin, and of the mystery of a crucified Saviour, will enable us to perceive the justice of God in all his punishments, temporal and eternal. We must deal decidedly with our lusts that war against our souls; let us not show them any mercy, but mortify, and crucify, and utterly destroy them. Thousands in the world that now is, have been undone by ungodly marriages; for there is more likelihood that the good will be perverted, than that the bad will be converted. Those who, in choosing yoke-fellows, keep not within the bounds of a profession of religion, cannot promise themselves helps meet for them.</body></html>
