It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-4.htm" title="Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your cattle, the increase of your cows, and the flocks of your sheep.">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-18.htm" title="Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your land, the increase of your cows, and the flocks of your sheep.">Deuteronomy 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-51.htm" title="And he shall eat the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your land, until you be destroyed: which also shall not leave you either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of your cows, or flocks of your sheep, until he have destroyed you.">Deuteronomy 28:51</a>. It is in form identical with Ashtaroth, and signifies "increase," or progeny.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - This favor would take effect in a blessing on the fruit of the womb, the produce of the field, and the increase of their flocks and herds (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-25.htm">Exodus 23:25-27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.</span> These comprise the fruitful products of the soil, and in their combination express general fertility and abundance. <span class="accented">By corn</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>) is undoubtedly to be understood the cereal products generally used for food. It may be doubted if <span class="accented">tirosh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>), properly means wine. The word is often rendered in the Authorized Version by new wine, and this is the meaning generally given in the lexicons. As, however, it is almost constantly joined with corn and oil, the immediate products of the soil - at least as unchanged by any process or manufacture - it is rather to be regarded as designating ripe grapes than wine. That, moreover, which was to be <span class="accented">gathered</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>), which might be <span class="accented">tithed</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-17.htm">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>), which might be described as <span class="accented">fruit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>), as <span class="accented">being in the cluster</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8</a>), and as capable of being <span class="accented">dried up</span> or <span class="accented">parched</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>), and <span class="accented">trodden</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-15.htm">Micah 7:15</a>), could not be a fluid like fermented nine. As the grape juice, however, was that from which wine was elicited, <span class="accented">tirosh</span> is sometimes used tropically for wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>), Just as corn is used for bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>). The <span class="accented">oil</span> here mentioned, and elsewhere joined with <span class="accented">dagan</span> and <span class="accented">tirosh</span>, is the pure fresh olive oil (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine), obtained by pressure from the berries of the olive, and used for food as well as for other purposes by the Jews (see notes on Deuteronomy 8:8). <span class="cmt_word">Flocks of thy sheep.</span> The Hebrew is very peculiar here; the same expression occurs only in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4, 18, 51</a>). Literally rendered, it is <span class="accented">the Astartes</span> (Ashtaroth) <span class="accented">of thy sheep</span>. Kimchi says it means "the females of the sheep" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>), and this Gesenius adopts, rendering the phrase by "ewes." Astarte ('Ash-toreth, plu. 'Ashtaroth) was the Phoenician Venus, and it is supposed that the females of the flock were called Astartes orVenuses, as propagating the flock. There is, however, another way of explaining the word as here used, by referring it to a root '<span class="accented">ashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), signifying to be multiplied, to be rich; whence the name given to the females as the multipliers of the flock, without any reference to Astarte. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:12-26 We are in danger of having fellowship with the works of darkness if we take pleasure in fellowship with those who do such works. Whatever brings us into a snare, brings us under a curse. Let us be constant to our duty, and we cannot question the constancy of God's mercy. Diseases are God's servants; they go where he sends them, and do what he bids them. It is therefore good for the health of our bodies, thoroughly to mortify the sin of our souls; which is our rule of duty. Yet sin is never totally destroyed in this world; and it actually prevails in us much more than it would do, if we were watchful and diligent. In all this the Lord acts according to the counsel of his own will; but that counsel being hid from us, forms no excuse for our sloth and negligence, of which it is in no degree the cause. We must not think, that because the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of the enemies of the soul, are not done immediately, therefore they will never be done. God will do his own work in his own method and time; and we may be sure that they are always the best. Thus corruption is driven out of the hearts of believers by little and little. The work of sanctification is carried on gradually; but at length there will be a complete victory. Pride, security, and other sins that are common effects of prosperity, are enemies more dangerous than beasts of the field, and more apt to increase upon us.</body></html>
