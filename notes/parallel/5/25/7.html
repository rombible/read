but the woman had her redress. She was to bring the matter before the eiders of the town, sitting as magistrates at the gate, and they were to summon the man and speak to him, and if he persisted in his refusal, the woman was to take his shoe from off his foot, and spit before his face, and say, <span class="cmt_word">So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.</span> The taking off of the shoe of the man by the woman was an act of indignity to him; it amounted to a declaration that he was not worthy to stand in his brother's place, and was scornfully rejected by the woman herself. As the planting of the shod foot on a piece of property, or the casting of the shoe over a field, was emblematical of taking possession of it with satisfaction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-9.htm">Psalm 108:9</a>); and as the voluntary handing of one's shoe to another betokened the giving up to that other of some property or right; so, contrariwise, the forcible removal from one of his shoe and the casting of it aside indicated contemptuous rejection of the owner, and repudiation of all his rights and claims in the matter. To walk barefooted was regarded by the Jews as ignominious and miserable (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>). The spitting before the face of the man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> in front of him) is by the Jewish interpreters understood of spitting on the ground in his presence (Talmud, 'Jebam.,' 106; Madmen., 'In Jibbum.,' 4:6-8). This seems to be what the words express (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-37.htm">Deuteronomy 4:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8</a>, for the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e4;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>); and this, according to Oriental notions, would be insult enough (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; Niebuhr, ' Description de l'Arabie,' 1:49). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:5-12 The custom here regulated seems to have been in the Jewish law in order to keep inheritances distinct; now it is unlawful.</body></html>
