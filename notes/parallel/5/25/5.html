And therefore the marriage specified was not necessarily between the brother and the brother's wife, but might be between other representatives of the two persons in question. (See Ruth 4)<p>The law is older than Moses. We first hear of it in the household of Judah the son of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-8.htm" title="And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.">Genesis 38:8</a>). The violation of the law then was punished with <span class= "ital">death, </span>not with disgrace only.<p>But that which makes the law most memorable, is the teaching elicited from the lips of our Saviour by the question which the Sadducees raised upon it (see marginal reference). It is worth while to observe that the law itself demands that in some sense there should be <span class= "ital">a resurrection. </span>Boaz puts it thus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-5.htm" title="Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.">Ruth 4:5</a>), "to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance." Why should the name of the dead be kept up, if the dead has passed out of existence? We may well believe that this law was partly intended (like baptism for the dead, or like giving children the names of their departed progenitors) for the express purpose of keeping alive the hope of resurrection in the minds of the chosen people.<p>(11,12) <span class= "bld">When men strive together. . . .--</span>Another precept of humanity. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-22.htm" title="If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.">Exodus 21:22</a>, "If men strive and hurt a woman with child," punishment or compensation must follow. The law in this place is the counterpart of that. Men must be protected as well as women.<p><span class= "bld">Putteth forth her hand and taketh him.</span>--"Him," i.e., him that smiteth her husband. The precept is to enforce modesty as well as to protect humanity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-10.</span> <span class="accented">- Levirate marriages</span>. If a man who was married died without issue, his surviving brother was required to marry the widow, so as to raise up a successor to the deceased, who should be his heir. The brother who refused this duty must be publicly disgraced. The design of this institution - which was not originated by Moses, but came down from early times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>), and is to be found amongst ether nations than the Jews, and that even in the present day - was to preserve a family from becoming extinct and to secure the property of a family from passing into the hands of a stranger. The notion that the usage "had its natural roots in the desire inherent in man who is born for immortality, and connected with the hitherto undeveloped belief in an eternal life, to secure a continued personal existence for himself and immortality for his name through the perpetuation of his family, and in the life of the son who took his place" (Keil), seems wholly fanciful. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dwell together</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not necessarily in the same house, but in the same community or place (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-6.htm">Genesis 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-7.htm">Genesis 36:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And have no child</span>; literally, have no son; but this is rightly interpreted as meaning <span class="accented">child</span> (<span class="accented">so</span> the LXX.; Vulgate; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-25.htm">Matthew 22:25</a>; Madmen., 'In Jibbum.,' 2:6-9); for, if the deceased left a daughter, the perpetuation of the family and the retention of the property might be secured through her (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-4.htm">Numbers 27:4</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:5-12 The custom here regulated seems to have been in the Jewish law in order to keep inheritances distinct; now it is unlawful.</body></html>
