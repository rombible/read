Does God take care for oxen?">1Corinthians 9:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-18.htm" title="For the scripture said, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.">1Timothy 5:18</a>). It is not only written for the sake of the oxen, but to prove that the "labourer is worthy of his hire;" "they that preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - The first and second verses should be read as one sentence, of which the protasis is in ver. 1 and the apodosis in ver. 2, thus: <span class="cmt_word">If there be a strife between men, and they come to judgment, and they</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the judges) <span class="cmt_word">give judgment on them, and justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked, then it shall be, if the wicked deserve to be beaten</span> (literally, <span class="accented">be the son of blows</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that the judge</span>, etc. It is assumed that the judges shall pronounce just judgment, and apportion to the guilty party his due punishment; and then it is prescribed how that is to be inflicted. In the presence of the judge the man was to be cast down, and the adjudged number of blows were to be given him, not, however, exceeding forty, lest the man should be rendered contemptible in the eyes of the people, as if he were a mere slave or brute. This punishment was usually inflicted with a stick (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, etc.), as is still the case among the Arabs and Egyptians; sometimes also with thorns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-7.htm">Judges 8:7, 16</a>); sometimes with whips and scorpions, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. scourges of cord or leather armed with sharp points or hard knots (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-11.htm">1 Kings 12:11, 14</a>). Though the culprit was laid on the ground, it does not appear that the bastinado was used among the Jews as it is now among the Arabs; the back and shoulders were the parts of the body on which the blows fell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-29.htm">Proverbs 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-3.htm">Proverbs 26:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to his fault, by a certain number</span>; literally, <span class="accented">according to the requirement of his crime in number</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. according as his crime deserved. The number was fixed at forty, probably because of the symbolical significance of that number as a measure of completeness. The rabbins fixed the number at thirty-nine, apparently in order that the danger of exceeding the number prescribed by the Law should be diminished (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>); but another reason is assigned by Maimonides, viz. that, as the instrument of punishment was a scourge with three tails, each stroke counted for three, and thus they could not give forty, but only thirty-nine, unless they exceeded the forty (Maimon., 'In Sanhedrin,' 17:2). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-3 Every punishment should be with solemnity, that those who see it may be filled with dread, and be warned not to offend in like manner. And though the criminals must be shamed as well as put to pain, for their warning and disgrace, yet care should be taken that they do not appear totally vile. Happy those who are chastened of the Lord to humble them, that they should not be condemned with the world to destruction.</body></html>
