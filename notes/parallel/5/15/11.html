The "poor" are in humble circumstances; the "needy" are actually in want. In commenting on this verse, Rashi asks a similar question to that of the lawyer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-29.htm" title="But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?">Luke 10:29</a>, "Who is this brother? Thy poor man." He might have added that "<span class= "ital">thy </span>poor" and "<span class= "ital">thy </span>needy" are expressions teaching the truth that we are "members one of another." We may not pass by our poorer brethren, and say we have nothing to do with them. Jehovah calls them ours--"<span class= "ital">thy </span>poor man," and "<span class= "ital">thy </span>needy man." The words are both in the singular number in the Hebrew. We cannot shake off the relationship or the responsibility in any one case.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - They were to open their hand wide to their poorer brethren, for there should always be such in the land. This statement is not inconsistent with that in ver. 4, for there it is the prevention of poverty by not dealing harshly with the poor that is spoken of; here it is the continuance of occasion for the relief of the poor that is referred to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-11 This year of release typified the grace of the gospel, in which is proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord; and by which we obtain the release of our debts, that is, the pardon of our sins. The law is spiritual, and lays restraints upon the thoughts of the heart. We mistake, if we think thoughts are free from God's knowledge and check. That is a wicked heart indeed, which raises evil thoughts from the good law of God, as theirs did, who, because God had obliged them to the charity of forgiving, denied the charity of giving. Those who would keep from the act of sin, must keep out of their minds the very thought of sin. It is a dreadful thing to have the cry of the poor justly against us. Grudge not a kindness to thy brother; distrust not the providence of God. What thou doest, do freely, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7.</body></html>
