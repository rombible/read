that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.">Jeremiah 34:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/34-13.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves, saying,">Jeremiah 34:13-14</a>, as given in the time of the Exodus, and as applicable both to men and women. It first appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2-11</a>, where it occupies the first section of the Sinaitic code. There is no need to suppose that anything enacted here is contradictory to the Law as given there; but there are certain peculiarities about the case of the female slave which create exceptions. (See below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise.">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>.) Rashi notes two fresh points in the Law as given in Deuteronomy: one concerning the Hebrew woman (an Hebrew "or an Hebrewess"--<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm" title="And if your brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-9.htm" title="That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.">Jeremiah 34:9</a>) and another concerning the "furnishing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-14.htm" title="You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your floor, and out of your wine press: of that with which the LORD your God has blessed you you shall give to him.">Deuteronomy 15:14</a>).<p>(12) <span class= "bld">In the seventh year.</span>--This is to be understood of the Sabbatical year whenever it came. It would rarely happen that the Hebrew slave would serve for the full period of six years.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - From injunctions regarding the treatment of the poor and of debtors the transition is easy to the law concerning slaves, inasmuch as it was through the stress of poverty that any became such from among their brethren. The law, as here laid down, is the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>, somewhat expanded; the most important addition being that the slave is not only to go free after six years of service, but is to be furnished by his master with the means of setting up a home for himself. The six years here specified are not to be confounded with the years ending at the sabbatical year; they are any six years during which the individual has been in bondage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:12-18 Here the law concerning Hebrew servants is repeated. There is an addition, requiring the masters to put some small stock into their servants' hands to set up with for themselves, when sent out of their servitude, wherein they had received no wages. We may expect family blessings, the springs of family prosperity, when we make conscience of our duty to our family relations. We are to remember that we are debtors to Divine justice, and have nothing to pay with. That we are slaves, poor, and perishing. But the Lord Jesus Christ, by becoming poor, and by shedding his blood, has made a full and free provision for the payment of our debts, the ransom of our souls, and the supply of all our wants. When the gospel is clearly preached, the acceptable year of the Lord is proclaimed; the year of release of our debts, of the deliverance of our souls, and of obtaining rest in him. And as faith in Christ and love to him prevail, they will triumph over the selfishness of the heart, and over the unkindness of the world, doing away the excuses that rise from unbelief, distrust, and covetousness.</body></html>
