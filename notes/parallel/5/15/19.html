This is the only interpretation consistent with the context in Leviticus; for Deuteronomy 27 deals entirely with "voluntary" offerings, which are in a sense outside the Law.

It is enjoined that, as all the firstborn were to be sanctified to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2-13</a>), they were not to work with the firstborn of their cattle, either by yoking the bullock to the plough or wagon or by shearing the sheep: these belonged to God, and were not to be put to any vulgar uses of men; year by year they were to be brought to the sanctuary, offered as sacrifices, and eaten before the Lord. If any of the firstborn animals were blind, or lame, or in any way blemished, such was not to be offered to the Lord, but might be used as food in their ordinary places of residence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:19-23 Here is a direction what to do with the firstlings. We are not now limited as the Israelites were; we make no difference between a first calf, or lamb, and the rest. Let us then look to the gospel meaning of this law, devoting ourselves and the first of our time and strength to God; and using all our comforts and enjoyments to his praise, and under the direction of his law, as we have them all by his gift.</body></html>
