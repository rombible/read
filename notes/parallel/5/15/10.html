I have thought it worth while to borrow the comments of Rashi on these verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/15-7.htm" title="If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:">Deuteronomy 15:7-10</a>) almost entire, to show how well the Jews have understood the true principles of Christian charity from the law of Moses. That people has always been remarkable for kindness to its own poor.<p><span class= "bld">For this thing.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">this word, </span>or <span class= "ital">this promise. </span>And Rashi observes, "Even when thou hast promised to give, thou wilt receive the reward of the promise as well as the reward of the deed;" and we may compare St. Paul. "If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-12.htm" title="For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that he has not.">2Corinthians 8:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall not be grieved</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall not become evil</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. shall not entertain a grudge. They were to give, not grudgingly or of necessity, merely through dread of God's displeasure, but cheerfully and spontaneously (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). For this God would bless them in all their works, so that they should not only be no losers, but should be gainers, by their generosity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-11 This year of release typified the grace of the gospel, in which is proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord; and by which we obtain the release of our debts, that is, the pardon of our sins. The law is spiritual, and lays restraints upon the thoughts of the heart. We mistake, if we think thoughts are free from God's knowledge and check. That is a wicked heart indeed, which raises evil thoughts from the good law of God, as theirs did, who, because God had obliged them to the charity of forgiving, denied the charity of giving. Those who would keep from the act of sin, must keep out of their minds the very thought of sin. It is a dreadful thing to have the cry of the poor justly against us. Grudge not a kindness to thy brother; distrust not the providence of God. What thou doest, do freely, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7.</body></html>
