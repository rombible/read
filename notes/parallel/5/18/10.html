In Hebrew the idea of "time" is not so clear. <span class= "ital">It </span>seems to mean practising <span class= "ital">hidden </span>arts. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm" title="You shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall you use enchantment, nor observe times.">Leviticus 19:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Enchanter.</span>--Whisperer, or serpent charmer. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-5.htm" title="Is not this it in which my lord drinks, and whereby indeed he divines? you have done evil in so doing.">Genesis 44:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Witch.</span>--One who uses charms or spells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Maketh his son or daughter to pass through the fire</span> (see note on Deuteronomy 12:31). <span class="cmt_word">That useth divination</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>, where the different methods of divination are enumerated). <span class="cmt_word">An observer of times.</span> This is according to the Targum, <span class="accented">observans horns</span>; the LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "one who augurs what is to happen;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui observat somnia atque auguria</span>. The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>) is part of a verb which signifies to cover, to use covert arts, to practice sorcery; though some derive it from the noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, a thick cloud, and explain it as "interpreter of clouds;" while others trace it to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, the eye, and explain it as "one who cheats by optical fascinations" (so the Syriac, <span class="accented">fascinans oculis</span>), or one who divines by inspection - an augur." <span class="cmt_word">An enchanter</span>; one who practices magic, or divines by signs (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-1.htm">Numbers 24:1</a>). It is sometimes said that the verb of which this word is a part (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, a serpent; whence it is inferred that the species of divination indicated by this word is <span class="accented">ophiomancy</span>, or divination by serpents, but this is not generally accepted by scholars. <span class="cmt_word">A witch</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">maleficus</span>); probably one who pretended to cure diseases, or procure some desired result, by means of nostrums and philtres. In the enumeration of the wise men of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), the Mecashephim have a place beside the Hartummim, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, they are joined with the Hachamim or Magi of Egypt; and this favors the conclusion that their sorcery had a quasi-scientific basis. The English word "witch" is now restricted to the <span class="accented">female</span> practicer of unlawful arts; formerly it was applied to <span class="accented">males</span> as well, if not chiefly (Trench, 'Select Glossary,' p. 806). <span class="cmt_word">A charmer</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>); a dealer in spells, one who by means of spells or charms pretends to achieve some desired result. The verb here used primarily means to bind, and the species of magic indicated is probably that practiced by binding certain knots, whereby it was supposed that the curse or blessing, as the case might he, was bound on its object; this was accompanied apparently with incantation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>). Comp. English <span class="accented">spell-bound</span>, and the phrase, "to rivet charms" (Jonson, 'Sad Shepherd,' 2:2). A species of incantation known to the Romans consisted in tying knots with threads of different colors, three in number, which were supposed to become a bond to secure an object (cf. Virg., 'Eclog.' 8:76, 77). <span class="cmt_word">A consulter with familiar spirits.</span> This phrase conveys something different from what is expressed, in the Hebrew. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> is one who asks or inquires of an Ob, that is, a Python, or divining spirit. This spirit was supposed to be in the person of the conjurer, and to be able to reveal to him what was secret or hidden in the future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a>). The notion of "a familiar spirit," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a spirit not dwelling in the person, but with which he is intimate - generally the spirit of one who formerly lived on earth - is a modern notion not known to Scripture. The persons here referred to were probably ventriloquists (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and used their faculty in this respect for purposes of magic, pretending that they had within them a spirit which they could consult, and by which they could predict what would happen or reveal what was hid. <span class="cmt_word">Wizard</span>. The English word "wizard" did not originally convey the idea of anything evil in the person of whom it was used; Milton applies it to the Magi who came to worship at Bethlehem ('Ode on the Nativity,' 4.); it meant merely "the wise one," or "the knowing one;" and thus is an exact equivalent for the Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, knowing, wise, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, to know). <span class="cmt_word">A necromancer</span>; one who professed to call up the dead, and from them to learn the secrets of futurity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>). (See on all these names the learned and copious dissertation of Dr. Holmes, art. 'Divination,' in Kitto's 'Bibl. Cyclop.,' 3rd. edit., 1:682.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:9-14 Was it possible that a people so blessed with Divine institutions, should ever be in any danger of making those their teachers whom God had made their captives? They were in danger; therefore, after many like cautions, they are charged not to do after the abominations of the nations of Canaan. All reckoning of lucky or unlucky days, all charms for diseases, all amulets or spells to prevent evil, fortune-telling, etc. are here forbidden. These are so wicked as to be a chief cause of the rooting out of the Canaanites. It is amazing to think that there should be any pretenders of this kind in such a land, and day of light, as we live in. They are mere impostors who blind and cheat their followers.</body></html>
