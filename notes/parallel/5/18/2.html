<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the front leg, the two jaw-bones, and the rough stomach of ruminants, in which the digestion is completed. These were regarded as the choice parts of the animal, and were to be given to the priests in addition to the wave breast and heave leg of the peace offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>), which belonged to the firings of Jehovah, mentioned in ver. 1.

"This right was probably accorded to the priests as a compensation for the falling off which would take place in their incomes in consequence of the repeal of the law that every animal was to be slaughtered at the sanctuary as a sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17.htm">Leviticus 17</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>. <span class="accented">sqq</span>.)"(<span class="accented">Keil</span>). According to Josephus ('Antiq ,' 4:4, 4), Philo ('De Praemiis. Sacerdot.,' p. 832, Opp., tom. 2. p. 235, edit. Maugey), the Talmud, etc., this injunction relates to the slaying of animals at home for private use, and not such as were killed for sacrifice. But the use here of the sacrificial phraseology, <span class="cmt_word">who offer a sacrifice</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, who slay victims for sacrifice - a phrase nowhere found except in connection with sacrificial rites) is adverse to this; and besides, how could such an enactment be carried out? How could people, residing at a distance, convey to the priests the portions due to them every time they slaughtered an animal for domestic use? At the same time, the sacrifices here referred to do not seem to be included in the offerings by fire above mentioned; and these gifts to the priest seem to have been something over and above his ordinary dues. There is probability, therefore, in the suggestion that "the reference is to the slaughtering of oxen, sheep, or goats, which were not intended for <span class="accented">shelamim</span> in the more limited sense, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for one of the three species of peace offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15, 16</a>), but for festal meals in the broader sense, which were held in connection with the sacrificial meals prepared from the <span class="accented">shelamim"</span> (Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 Care is taken that the priests entangle not themselves with the affairs of this life, nor enrich themselves with the wealth of this world; they have better things to mind. Care is likewise taken that they want not the comforts and conveniences of this life. The people must provide for them. He that has the benefit of solemn religious assemblies, ought to give help for the comfortable support of those that minister in such assemblies.</body></html>
