"Unto you first God, having raised up His son Jesus, sent Him to bless you." It must not be forgotten that the prophetic office is still continued to our risen Lord. He still "speaketh from heaven." But He "descended first into the lower parts of the earth." He has "the keys of hell and of death;" and knows all their secrets. They who can draw near to Him have no need to look downward, to consult dead relatives, or seek knowledge from spirits whose character, even if <span class= "ital">they </span>are accessible, is beyond our discernment. The Holy Spirit, our Comforter and Advocate on earth, and the Prophet, our Advocate that speaketh from heaven, are enough for all human need. What we cannot learn from them, or from the light they give us, it is better not to know.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">According to all that thou desiredst . . . in Horeb.</span>--It should never be forgotten that the Prophet like to Moses was promised on "the day of the assembly."

"He shall not speak of Himself.

For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven:">Hebrews 12:25</a>.)<p>(20) <span class= "bld">That prophet shall die.</span>--Rashi illustrates this by the case of Hananiah (Jeremiah 28) who prophesied that Jeconiah, and all that went with him to Babylon, should return within <span class= "ital">two years. </span>He was sentenced by Jeremiah to die that year; and he died accordingly, within <span class= "ital">two months.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-22.</span> - There should be no need for Israel to turn to heathen soothsayers, or diviners, or such like, because from amongst themselves, of their own brethren, would God raise up prophets like unto Moses, who, as occasion required, would reveal to them what God willed them to know. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A Prophet</span>. The Hebrew word so rendered (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) is a derivative from a verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>), which signifies to tell, to announce; hence the primary concept of the word is that of announcer, or forth-speaker; and to this the word "prophet" (Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, I speak before or in place of) closely corresponds; the prophet is one who speaks in the place of God, who conveys God's word to men, who is an interpreter of God to men. (<span class="accented">As</span> illustrative of the meaning of the word, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a>.) Hence Abraham is called a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>), and the term is applied to the patriarchs generally (<span class="accented">Psalm</span> 105:15); God conveyed his mind to them, and they spoke it forth to others (cf. <span class="accented">Amos</span> 3:7). <span class="cmt_word">Like unto me.</span> When the people heard the voice of God speaking to them at Sinai, and from the midst of the fire uttering to them the Ten Words, they were struck with terror, and besought that they might not again hear that awful voice, but that Moses might act as mediator between God and them - might hear what God should <span class="accented">say</span>, and speak it unto them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-27</a>). Moses thus became God's prophet to the people; and of this he reminds them here, as well as of the circumstances amid which he entered specially on this office (cf. vers. 16, 17). The phrase, "<span class="accented">like</span> unto <span class="accented">me</span>," does not necessarily imply that the prophet who was to come after Moses was to be in every respect the same as he; all that is indicated is that he would act as Moses had acted as a mediator between God and the people in the way of conveying his will to them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:15-22 It is here promised concerning Christ, that there should come a Prophet, great above all the prophets; by whom God would make known himself and his will to the children of men, more fully and clearly than he had ever done before. He is the Light of the world, Joh 8:12. He is the World by whom God speaks to us, Joh 1:1; Heb 1:2. In his birth he should be one of their nation. In his resurrection he should be raised up at Jerusalem, and from thence his doctrine should go forth to all the world. Thus God, having raised up his Son Christ Jesus, sent him to bless us. He should be like unto Moses, only above him. This prophet is come, even JESUS; and is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. The view of God which he gives, will not terrify or overwhelm, but encourages us. He speaks with fatherly affection and Divine authority united. Whoever refuses to listen to Jesus Christ, shall find it is at his peril; the same that is the Prophet is to be his Judge, Joh 12:48. Woe then to those who refuse to hearken to His voice, to accept His salvation, or yield obedience to His sway! But happy they who trust in Him, and obey Him. He will lead them in the paths of safety and peace, until He brings them to the land of perfect light, purity, and happiness. Here is a caution against false prophets. It highly concerns us to have a right touchstone wherewith to try the word we hear, that we may know what that word is which the Lord has not spoken. Whatever is against the plain sense of the written word, or which gives countenance or encouragement to sin, we may be sure is not that which the Lord has spoken.</body></html>
