The "two cheeks and the maw" are not mentioned elsewhere, and the latter word is found in this place only. They are not a valuable part of the sacrifice. An absurd reason for the gift is assigned by Rashi. We know that in the time of Eli, the priests varied their requirements at pleasure, and in the face of the law (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;">1Samuel 2:13</a>). The "priests' <span class= "ital">due </span>"here, and "the priests' <span class= "ital">custom</span>" there, are the same word in Hebrew, which we have elsewhere translated "requirement."<p>(4) <span class= "bld">The flrstfruit also of thy corn.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm" title="All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given you.">Numbers 18:12</a>. The first of the wool is mentioned here only. The quantity in all these cases has been defined by the Rabbis, on grounds somewhat arbitrary.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">To stand to minister in the name of the Lord.</span>--This is the office of the priests. The Levites are said, "to stand before the congregation to minister unto them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-9.htm" title="Seems it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?">Numbers 16:9</a>). If the writer of Deuteronomy knew no distinction between priest and Levite, it is difficult to see how the Jews could have derived the distinctive privileges of the priests from these enactments.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priests the Levites, the whole tribe of Levi</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the whole tribe of Levi, including both the priests and the general body of the Levites. <span class="cmt_word">They shall eat the offerings of the Lord made by fire.</span> "The offerings of the Lord made by fire" (literally, <span class="accented">the fires or firings of Jehovah</span>), here referred to, were the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass effusing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his inheritance</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. of Jehovah, what was appropriated to him, and from him to the tribe of Levi, such as tithes, firstlings, and firstfruits. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 Care is taken that the priests entangle not themselves with the affairs of this life, nor enrich themselves with the wealth of this world; they have better things to mind. Care is likewise taken that they want not the comforts and conveniences of this life. The people must provide for them. He that has the benefit of solemn religious assemblies, ought to give help for the comfortable support of those that minister in such assemblies.</body></html>
