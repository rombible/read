(that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6-7</a>).<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Neither is it beyond the sea.</span>--St. Paul continues, "Or (say not), Who shall <span class= "ital">descend </span>into <span class= "ital">the deep? </span>that is, <span class= "ital">to bring up Christ again from the dead." </span>The alteration here is remarkable. The LXX. will not account for it. "Beyond the sea" generally suggests the idea of a land on the other side of the surface of the ocean. But a descent into the <span class= "ital">"</span>abyss," which is what St. Paul indicates, means a passage through the sea to that which is beneath it, "beyond the sea "in a very different sense. No one but Jonah ever went beyond the sea in this way, as he says, "Out of the belly of hell cried I . . . Thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the heart of the seas . . . I went down to the bottoms of the mountains . . . The <span class= "ital">deep </span>(abyss) <span class= "ital">closed me about." </span>And this descent of Jonah is chosen as the "sign" of Christ's descent into hell.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">But the word is very nigh unto thee.</span>--Here the difference between the Jewish and the Christian commentator is very striking. "The Law is given you in Scripture and in tradition" (written and orally), says Rashi on this place. But St. Paul continues thus: "But what saith it (the righteousness of faith)? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart, that is, the word of faith which we preach; that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." It is worthy of notice that St. Paul in this place contrasts the righteousness of faith with the righteousness of the law, and describes both alike in the words of the Pentateuch. Concerning the righteousness of the law, he says, Moses describeth it, "The man which doeth those things shall live by them." The citation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-5.htm" title="You shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:5</a>. And there is a similar passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-25.htm" title="And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.">Deuteronomy 6:25</a>. What could more clearly prove that the covenant of Deuteronomy 28, 29 was meant to present the way of salvation from a different point of view to the Sinaitic covenant, and was "beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb." Not that we are to suppose there was ever a different way of salvation. The Decalogue itself begins (like the new covenant) with "I am the Lord thy God." But, unlike the new covenant, it makes no provision whereby Israel may keep the laws arising out of the relationship. The new covenant not only asserts the relationship, but provides the means whereby men may walk worthy of it. "I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their heart." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-13.htm" title="That he may establish you to day for a people to himself, and that he may be to you a God, as he has said to you, and as he has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.">Deuteronomy 29:13</a>.)<p>It is only in the power of this principle that Moses, in the exhortation which he founds on this statement of the way of righteousness through faith, could say as he did in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-19.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, "therefore choose life."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-14.</span> - The fulfillment of this condition was not impossible or even difficult; for God had done everything to render it easy for them.

Nor was this revelation made in some far distant place across the sea, so that any need say, <span class="cmt_word">Who will go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</span> On the contrary, it was very near to them, had been disclosed in words so that they could utter it with their own mouth, converse over it, and ponder it in their hearts (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>). In the allusion to the sea, the representation is not that of depth (Targum Jon.), but that of distance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:11-14 The law is not too high for thee. It is not only known afar off; it is not confined to men of learning. It is written in thy books, made plain, so that he who runs may read it. It is in thy mouth, in the tongue commonly used by thee, in which thou mayest hear it read, and talk of it among thy children. It is delivered so that it is level to the understanding of the meanest. This is especially true of the gospel of Christ, to which the apostle applies it. But the word is nigh us, and Christ in that word; so that if we believe with the heart, that the promises of the Messiah are fulfilled in our Lord Jesus, and confess them with our mouth, we then have Christ with us.</body></html>
