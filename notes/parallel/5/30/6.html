When Israel should return to the Lord, he would take away from them the evil heart of unbelief, and give them the new heart and the right spirit. "Qui pravis affectibus renunciat is circumcisus corde dicitur" (Rosenm&uuml;ller. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 36:26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-10 In this chapter is a plain intimation of the mercy God has in store for Israel in the latter days. This passage refers to the prophetic warnings of the last two chapters, which have been mainly fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and in their dispersion to the present day; and there can be no doubt that the prophetic promise contained in these verses yet remain to come to pass. The Jewish nation shall in some future period, perhaps not very distant, be converted to the faith of Christ; and, many think, again settled in the land of Canaan. The language here used is in a great measure absolute promises; not merely a conditional engagement, but declaring an event assuredly to take place. For the Lord himself here engages to circumcise their hearts; and when regenerating grace has removed corrupt nature, and Divine love has supplanted the love of sin, they certainly will reflect, repent, return to God, and obey him; and he will rejoice in doing them good. The change that will be wrought upon them will not be only outward, or consisting in mere opinions; it will reach to their souls. It will produce in them an utter hatred of all sin, and a fervent love to God, as their reconciled God in Christ Jesus; they will love him with all their hearts, and with all their soul. They are very far from this state of mind at present, but so were the murderers of the Lord Jesus, on the day of Pentecost; who yet in one hour were converted unto God. So shall it be in the day of God's power; a nation shall be born in a day; the Lord will hasten it in his time. As a conditional promise this passage belongs to all persons and all people, not to Israel only; it assures us that the greatest sinners, if they repent and are converted, shall have their sins pardoned, and be restored to God's favour.</body></html>
