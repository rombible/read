The word is only found here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-12.htm" title="So I gave them up to their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.">Psalm 81:12</a> outside the writings of Jeremiah, who uses it eight times.<p><span class= "bld">To add drunkenness to thirst</span>--i.e., the indulgence of the desire to the desire itself; to add sin to temptation. The LXX. have a strange paraphrase, "So that the sinner shall not involve the righteous with him in destruction." The thought seems to be that, perhaps, one idolater would not make so much difference to Israel. He would never involve the whole nation in destruction. The drunkard could not be the ruin of the thirsty, so to speak, and, therefore, he might do as he pleased, and might, in fact, escape punishment, being protected by the general prosperity of Israel. The quotation in the Epistle to the Hebrews meets this mistaken view admirably: "Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and <span class= "ital">thereby many be defiled." </span>The Targums render "to add sins of infirmity to sins of presumption," a rendering which partly explains that of the LXX.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he bless himself in his heart</span>; - congratulate himself - <span class="cmt_word">saying, I shall have peace</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all shall be well with me - though - rather, for - <span class="cmt_word">I walk in the imagination of mine heart</span>; literally, in <span class="accented">the firmness or hardness of my heart</span>, (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to twist together, to be tough or firm); the word is always used in a bad sense in Hebrew, though not in Aramaic (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a> [12]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-13.htm">Jeremiah 9:13</a> [14]; 11:8). <span class="cmt_word">To add drunkenness to thirst</span>; a proverbial expression, of which very different explanations have been given. It is now generally admitted that the verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) cannot be taken here in the sense of "add," but has its proper sense of pouring out, pouring away, destroying. The word rendered "drunkenness" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to be sated with moisture, to be drenched) means rather "sated, drenched, well-watered;" and the word rendered "thirst" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, to thirst) is properly thirsty, and is used of dry land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>); both are adjectives, and a substantive is to be supplied. Some supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, soul or person; others, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e5;</span>, land. The former render, "The full [soul] with the thirsty" (Gesenius); or, "Them that are sated with them that are thirsty," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as well those who have imbibed the poison as those who thirst for it (Knobel); or "That the sated [soul] may destroy the thirsty," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that the impious one, restrained by no law and, as it were, drunk with crime, may corrupt others, also prone to evil, and bring on them destruction (Maurer). Those who supply "land," render "To destroy the well-watered [land] with the dry." This last seems the preferable rendering; but the general meaning is the same in either case, viz. that the effect of such hardness of heart would be to destroy one and all. "The Orientals are fond of such bipartite forms of expressing the whole (cf. Gesenius, 'Thes.,' p. 1008)" (Knobel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:10-21 The national covenant made with Israel, not only typified the covenant of grace made with true believers, but also represented the outward dispensation of the gospel. Those who have been enabled to consent to the Lord's new covenant of mercy and grace in Jesus Christ, and to give up themselves to be his people, should embrace every opportunity of renewing their open profession of relation to him, and their obligation to him, as the God of salvation, walking according thereto. The sinner is described as one whose heart turns away from his God; there the mischief begins, in the evil heart of unbelief, which inclines men to depart from the living God to dead idols. Even to this sin men are now tempted, when drawn aside by their own lusts and fancies. Such men are roots that bear gall and wormwood. They are weeds which, if let alone, overspread the whole field. Satan may for a time disguise this bitter morsel, so that thou shalt not have the natural taste of it, but at the last day, if not before, the true taste shall be discerned. Notice the sinner's security in sin. Though he hears the words of the curse, yet even then he thinks himself safe from the wrath of God. There is scarcely a threatening in all the book of God more dreadful than this. Oh that presumptuous sinners would read it, and tremble! for it is a real declaration of the wrath of God, against ungodliness and unrighteousness of man.</body></html>
