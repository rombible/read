But they cannot be right in so doing. For though the pronoun "these" in Hebrew has nothing to determine whether it belongs to what precedes or to what follows, yet the context shows that the covenant is described in Deuteronomy 29, not in Deuteronomy 28 (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/29-12.htm" title="That you should enter into covenant with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God makes with you this day:">Deuteronomy 29:12-15</a> below). It is very significant that this "covenant in the land of Moab" <span class= "ital">stands outside </span>the tremendous sanction appended to the expansion of the Sinaitic covenant in Deuteronomy. The effect of this arrangement may be illustrated by a reference to Leviticus 26, 27. The "sanction" of the law in Leviticus, which is a complete code of ceremonial and moral holiness, is contained in Deuteronomy 26. But that chapter is followed by a passage respecting vows, which are not compulsory, and therefore obviously lie, as a whole, outside that which is "commanded." The position of Deuteronomy 29, 30 is analogous to that of Leviticus 27. Thus we see that the tremendous curse of the Sinaitic covenant <span class= "ital">is not the end of God's dealings with the chosen people. </span>After that, there is still another covenant, to the force of which there is no limit (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-15.htm" title="But with him that stands here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:">Deuteronomy 29:15</a> below). The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable. Nothing can destroy the relation between Jehovah and Israel. Their resurrection as a nation may well be described by the words of Moses in Psalms 90, "Thou turnest man to destruction (national death--Deuteronomy 28), and sayest (Deuteronomy 29, 30), <span class= "ital">Return, </span>ye children of men (resurrection). <span class= "ital">For </span>a thousand years in thy sight (though spent in the grave) are but as yesterday when it is past, and as <span class= "ital">a watch in the night</span>" (to be followed by the dawn of morning). "A watch in the night" is not the blackness of darkness for ever.<p><span class= "bld">Beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.</span>--It should be carefully noted that the formal repetition of the law in Moses' second great discourse in this book opens with these words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm" title="The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>), "the <span class= "ital">Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb." </span>There is no real break in Deuteronomy from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-1.htm" title="And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and keep, and do them.">Deuteronomy 5:1</a> to the end of Deuteronomy 26 and Deuteronomy 27, 28 are the "sanction" of that covenant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.</span> This was not a new covenant in addition to that made at Sinai, but simply a renewal and reaffirmation of that covenant. At Sinai the covenant was, properly speaking, <span class="accented">made</span>; sacrifices were then offered, and the people were sprinkled with the sacrificial blood, whereby the covenant was ratified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>); but on the occasion here referred to, no sacrifices were offered, for this was merely the recognition of the covenant formerly made as still subsisting. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-9 Both former mercies, and fresh mercies, should be thought on by us as motives to obedience. The hearing ear, and seeing eye, and the understanding heart, are the gift of God. All that have them, have them from him. God gives not only food and raiment, but wealth and large possessions, to many to whom he does not give grace. Many enjoy the gifts, who have not hearts to perceive the Giver, nor the true design and use of the gifts. We are bound, in gratitude and interest, as well as in duty and faithfulness, to keep the words of the covenant.</body></html>
