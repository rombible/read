All are appealed to, from the captains of the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-10.htm" title="You stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,">Deuteronomy 29:10</a>), to the little ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-11.htm" title="Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water:">Deuteronomy 29:11</a>), and the lowest slaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-11.htm" title="Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water:">Deuteronomy 29:11</a>). And the point set before them is one simple thing, to accept Jehovah as their God. All this is very closely reproduced in Joshua 24 (see Notes in that place).<p><span class= "bld">Ye have seen.</span>--The pronoun is emphatic. Yourselves are witnesses. I need not repeat the story. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/11-2.htm" title="And know you this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,">Deuteronomy 11:2-7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Moses addresses the nation as such, and reminds them of their dullness to apprehend the manifestations of God's grace which had been so abundantly afforded in their past history, in order that he may arouse them to a better state of mind, and stimulate them to hearken to the voice of God in the future. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-9 Both former mercies, and fresh mercies, should be thought on by us as motives to obedience. The hearing ear, and seeing eye, and the understanding heart, are the gift of God. All that have them, have them from him.

Many enjoy the gifts, who have not hearts to perceive the Giver, nor the true design and use of the gifts. We are bound, in gratitude and interest, as well as in duty and faithfulness, to keep the words of the covenant.</body></html>
