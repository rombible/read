"I make this covenant binding with all your generations, in case there should even now be any root of idolatry among you which may grow up and bring forth fruit in later times, and bring a curse upon your whole country." That there were such roots of idolatry is only too plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>, and from what followed after the death of the elders of this generation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/2-10.htm" title="And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.">Judges 2:10-12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A root that beareth gall and wormwood.</span>--The same two words occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-19.htm" title="Remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.">Lamentations 3:19</a>, and one of them (gall) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm" title="They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.">Psalm 69:21</a>. From whatever root it came, there was One to whom it was given to drink. The LXX. form of this expression, "lest there is among you any <span class= "ital">root </span>that <span class= "ital">springeth up </span>in gall and <span class= "ital">bitterness," </span>is incorporated into the warning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a> : "Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any <span class= "ital">root of bitterness springing up </span>trouble you, and thereby many be defiled."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest there should be among you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">See that there be not among you</span>, etc. The part. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">lest</span>, at the beginning of a sentence, sometimes implies a prohibition or dissuasion, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-13.htm">Job 32:13</a>, "say not;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18</a>," beware of saying" (Gesenius, Noldius <span class="accented">in voc</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Gall</span>. The Hebrew word so rendered (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is supposed by Gesenius to be the poppy plant, by Celsius to be the hemlock (it is so rendered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>, and by AEdman to be colocynth. It is probably a general name for what is poisonous and bitter; for it is used of poison generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>) and of the venom of asps (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-16.htm">Job 20:16</a>), as well as of poisonous roots and bitter fruits (see Kitto, 'Bibl. Cycl.,' 3:701). Coupled here with <span class="cmt_word">wormwood</span>, it must be a plant that is referred to; and the union of the two affords "a striking image of the destructive fruit borne by idolatry" (Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:10-21 The national covenant made with Israel, not only typified the covenant of grace made with true believers, but also represented the outward dispensation of the gospel. Those who have been enabled to consent to the Lord's new covenant of mercy and grace in Jesus Christ, and to give up themselves to be his people, should embrace every opportunity of renewing their open profession of relation to him, and their obligation to him, as the God of salvation, walking according thereto. The sinner is described as one whose heart turns away from his God; there the mischief begins, in the evil heart of unbelief, which inclines men to depart from the living God to dead idols. Even to this sin men are now tempted, when drawn aside by their own lusts and fancies. Such men are roots that bear gall and wormwood. They are weeds which, if let alone, overspread the whole field. Satan may for a time disguise this bitter morsel, so that thou shalt not have the natural taste of it, but at the last day, if not before, the true taste shall be discerned. Notice the sinner's security in sin. Though he hears the words of the curse, yet even then he thinks himself safe from the wrath of God. There is scarcely a threatening in all the book of God more dreadful than this. Oh that presumptuous sinners would read it, and tremble! for it is a real declaration of the wrath of God, against ungodliness and unrighteousness of man.</body></html>
