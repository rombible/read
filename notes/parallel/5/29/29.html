Rashi connects the "secret things" with the "imagination of the evil heart of the secret idolater" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-19.htm" title="And it come to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:">Deuteronomy 29:19</a>. (The "secret faults" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-12.htm" title="Who can understand his errors? cleanse you me from secret faults.">Psalm 19:12</a> is the same expression.) His note runs thus: "And if thou say, What can we do? wilt Thou punish the many for the devices of the one? as it is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>), 'lest there be among you <span class= "ital">man or woman,' </span>and afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm" title="So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid on it;">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>), 'they shall see the plagues <span class= "ital">of that land</span>;' and yet, Is there any man that knoweth the secrets of his fellow? It is not that I shall punish you for those secrets; they belong to the Lord our God, and He will exact them from the individual sinner; but the things that are <span class= "ital">disclosed </span>belong to us and to our children, to 'put away the evil from the midst of us.' And if judgment is not executed among them, the many will be punished." But it is impossible not to feel that there is more behind the words of this passage than this. We must remember that Moses was delivering to Israel not law only but prophecy. And further, we may be certain that there was more in this latter portion of his prophecy than he could understand. May not this be one of the occasions concerning which the apostle says of the prophets, that they "searched <span class= "ital">what or what manner of time </span>the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify"? All those curses were to come upon Israel, and yet, after that, there was still a covenant with them, embracing every generation to the world's end. Must not Moses have longed to know what would befall his people in the latter days? and if we ourselves, "upon whom the ends of the world are come," do not yet see the future of Israel distinctly, are not the words appropriate still? "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: the things that are revealed belong to us and <span class= "ital">to our children for ever." </span>To the very end, what better way is there than this? "Lord, I have <span class= "ital">hoped for Thy salvation, </span>and <span class= "ital">done Thy commandments" </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-166.htm" title="LORD, I have hoped for your salvation, and done your commandments.">Psalm 119:166</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - By <span class="cmt_word">secret</span> things, here, some understand "hidden sins," which are known only to God, and which he will punish (Targum Jon.); but the meaning rather is, things in God's purpose known only to himself: these things, it is affirmed, belong to him, are his affair, and may be left with him. On the other hand, the things revealed are the things made known by God to man in his Word, viz. his injunctions, threatenings, and promises; and with these men have to do. This verse is by some regarded as part of the answer given to the question of ver. 24; but others regard it as a general reflection added by Moses by way of admonition to his previous discourse. This latter view is the more probable, and the scribes may have had this in their mind when they distinguished the words, <span class="cmt_word">unto us and to our children</span>, by placing over them extraordinary points , in order to emphasize them, though by many this is regarded as a mere critical notation, indicating a various reading (Buxtorf, 'Tiberias,' 1. c. 17, p. 179; Havernick, 'Introd.,' p. 281; Bleek, 'Einleit,' p. 799). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:29 Moses ends his prophecy of the Jews' rejection, just as St. Paul ends his discourse on the same subject, when it began to be fulfilled, Ro 11:33. We are forbidden curiously to inquire into the secret counsels of God, and to determine concerning them. But we are directed and encouraged, diligently to seek into that which God has made known. He has kept back nothing that is profitable for us, but only that of which it is good for us to be ignorant. The end of all Divine revelation is, not to furnish curious subjects of speculation and discourse, but that we may do all the words of this law, and be blessed in our deed. This, the Bible plainly reveals; further than this, man cannot profitably go. By this light he may live and die comfortably, and be happy for ever.</body></html>
