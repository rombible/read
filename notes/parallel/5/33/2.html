He came <span class= "ital">with </span>ten thousands of saints is a mere mistranslation. The preposition is "from," not "with." If the verb "he came," in the fourth line, is taken to refer to God, we must translate: "He came from ten thousands of saints" (to sinful men). Rashi takes "from" to mean "part of." "There came some of His ten thousands of saints, but not all of them." I believe the true translation is what I have given. The law itself was "ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>).

"<span class= "bld">A FIERY LAW</span>."<p>THE original expression, <span class= "ital">eshdath </span>or <span class= "ital">esh dath, </span>sometimes written as one word, and sometimes as two, has created some difficulty. <span class= "ital">Esh </span>is "fire," and <span class= "ital">dath, </span>if taken as a distinct word, is "law." But <span class= "ital">dath </span>does not appear elsewhere in the <span class= "ital">Hebrew </span>of the Old Testament, until we meet it in the book of Esther, where it occurs frequently. It is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-36.htm" title="And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.">Ezra 8:36</a>. In the <span class= "ital">Chaldee </span>of Daniel and Ezra it occurs six times. Modern authorities assert that it is properly a Persian word. But since it is found in the Chaldee of Daniel, it was in use among the Chaldaeans before the Persian empire. The word has Semitic affinities. The Hebrewsyllable <span class= "ital">theth </span>would have nearly the same meaning. A <span class= "ital">datum </span>(or <span class= "ital">dictum</span>) is the nearest equivalent that we have. There seems no reason to doubt that the word <span class= "ital">dath </span>had obtained a place both in Chaldee and in Hebrew at the time of the Captivity. It is perfectly <span class= "ital">possible </span>that its existence in Chaldee dates very much earlier. We must remember that Chaldee was the language of the family of Abraham before they adopted Hebrew. "A <span class= "ital">Syrian </span>ready to perish was my father," is the confession dictated by Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm" title="And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>. Syriac and Chaldee in the Old Testament are names of the same language. In the Babylonish captivity the Jews really returned to their ancestral language. It is therefore quite conceivable that Chaldaean words lingered among them until the Exodus; and this word <span class= "ital">dath, </span>if it be a true Chaldaean word, may be an example. But, obviously, these Chaldaean reminiscences would be fewer as the years rolled on. The three Targums all take <span class= "ital">dath </span>to be "law" in this place. The LXX. has "angels" (<span class= "greekheb">???????</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>instead of the combination <span class= "ital">eshdath. </span>Possibly the word was taken as <span class= "ital">ashdoth </span>(plural of the Chaldee <span class= "ital">ashda</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>meaning "rays" (of light?) and so "angels." Comp., "He maketh His angels spirits, and <span class= "ital">His ministers a flame of fire</span>;" they "ran and returned as a flash of lightning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-14.htm" title="And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.">Ezekiel 1:14</a>). It is also possible that the LXX. read r instead of <span class= "ital">d </span>in the word which they had before them, and that they arrived at the meaning "angels" through the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">sharath, </span>"to minister." The confusion between <span class= "ital">r </span>and <span class= "ital">d, </span>which are extremely alike in Hebrew, is very common. The parallels referred to in the notes on the verse show that "fiery law" will yield a good sense. The only question is whether <span class= "ital">dath, </span>"law," can be reasonably supposed to have occurred in the Mosaic writings. If the word were at all generally known at that period, to whatever language it properly belonged, it would hardly have escaped such a man as Moses. I think it quite possible that the common translation may be right. The Hebrew commentators accept it. The only alternative I can suggest is that of the LXX., which cannot be verified with certainty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said.</span> Here begin the words of Moses.

These places are not mentioned as scenes of different manifestations of the Divine glory, but as indicating the extent to which the one manifestation given at Sinai reached. The light of the Divine glory that rested on Sinai was reflected also from the mountains of Seir and Paran (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He came with ten thousands of saints</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he came from ten thousands of holy ones</span>; literally, <span class="accented">out from myriads of holiness</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "from his celestial seat, where myriads of angels surround his throne" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The rendering "with," though that of the Targum, LXX., and Vulgate, cannot be retained; nor does Scripture represent God as attended by angels when he comes forth to manifest his glory to men. They are represented as surrounding his throne in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>), as his servants awaiting his behest, and his host that do his pleasure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>); and God is represented as dwelling in the midst of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>). Hence he is represented here as coming forth from among them to manifest himself to his people. <span class="cmt_word">A fiery law</span>. There is a various reading here; instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5dd;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, fire of law, many codices have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> in one word, and this is supported by the Samaritan text and other authorities, and is accepted by most critics and interpreters. It is a fatal objection to the textual reading that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> is not a Semitic word, but one of Persian origin, brought by the Jews from Babylonia, and found only in the post-exilian books (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9, 13, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5, 9, 13, 16</a>); and in them as applied to the Law of God only by heathens. It is, therefore, altogether improbable that this word should be found in any Hebrew writing anterior to the Captivity. Besides, what is the sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, supposing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> to mean "law?" The words cannot be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, by "fiery law;" they can only be rendered by "a fire, a law," or "a fire of law," and What either of these may mean it is not easy to see. The ancient versions vary here very considerably: LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">fin dextera ejus ignea lex</span>; Targum of Onkelos, "Written by his right hand, from the midst of the fire, a law gave he to us;" Syriac, "With myriads of his saints at his right hand. He gave to them, and also caused all peoples to love them." The best Hebrew manuscripts have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> as one word. The Masoretic note is, "The <span class="accented">Chatiph is</span> one word, and the <span class="accented">K'ri</span> two." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> is best explained as a compound of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span>, an Aramaic word signifying to throw or dart; the Syriac , or the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, having the same signification, so that the meaning is "fire-dartings:" from his right hand went rays of fire like arrows shot forth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the Israelites, to whom this manifestation was vouchsafed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-5 To all his precepts, warnings, and prophecies, Moses added a solemn blessing. He begins with a description of the glorious appearances of God, in giving the law. His law works like fire. If received, it is melting, warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; if rejected, it hardens, sears, pains, and destroys. The Holy Spirit came down in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law. The law of God written in the heart, is a certain proof of the love of God shed abroad there: we must reckon His law one of the gifts of his grace.</body></html>
