Upon "He was king in Jeshurun," Rashi says, "The Holy One, blessed be He! the yoke of His kingdom is upon them for ever." It may be so. "When the Lord your God was your king," is Samuel's description of the whole history of Israel previous to himself.<p>The certainty that the King of kings, the Messiah of Israel, was and is the Lawgiver and Teacher, and Keeper of all saints, and that there are none of that character who do not "sit at the feet of Jesus," makes the real meaning of the passage perfectly plain, even though the exact grammatical relation of the clauses may be not beyond dispute.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Moses here, identifying himself with the people, uses the third person, and includes himself among those to whom the Law was given; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20.htm">Psalm 20, 21</a>, where David not only speaks of himself in the third person, but addresses such prayers for himself as could only be offered by the people for their king (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-12.htm">Judges 5:12, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even the inheritance of the congregation.</span> The "even," which the translators of the Authorized Version have inserted here, were better omitted; the words are in apposition to "law." The Law which Moses communicated to Israel was to remain with them as the inheritance f the congregation. The Bishops' Bible and the Geneva Version have, more correctly, "for an inheritance of the congregation." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-5 To all his precepts, warnings, and prophecies, Moses added a solemn blessing. He begins with a description of the glorious appearances of God, in giving the law. His law works like fire. If received, it is melting, warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; if rejected, it hardens, sears, pains, and destroys. The Holy Spirit came down in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law. The law of God written in the heart, is a certain proof of the love of God shed abroad there: we must reckon His law one of the gifts of his grace.</body></html>
