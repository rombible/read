The word rendered t, lawgiver," or "leader" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span>), signifies primarily one who ordains or appoints, and is used in both the above senses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>); it is here applied to Gad, because that tribe displayed such promptitude and energy at the head of the tribes in the conquest of the land, that it might be regarded as their leader. An entirely different view of the passage has been taken by some, who by the <span class="accented">mechokek</span> understand Moses as the lawgiver, and his portion as the place of his grave, which was concealed, but was within the inheritance of Gad. But it is a fatal objection to this view that not only is the word rendered "portion" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) nowhere used of a grave, but the grave of Moses on Mount Nebo was in the territory of Reuben, not in that of Gad. Gesenius renders, "The portion of (assigned by) the lawgiver was preserved." But this does not tally with the immediately preceding statement, that Gad <span class="accented">chose</span> his portion for himself; at any rate, it could not be <span class="accented">because</span> of this that he chose it. Gad chose for himself a portion on the east of Jordan, and the portion he had chosen was sacredly kept for him, though he went with his brethren to the conquest of Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">And he came with the heads of the people</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his place of marching was with the leaders; his place was at the head of the tribes (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17, 21, 32</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-14.htm">Joshua 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-12.htm">Joshua 4:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He executed the justice of the Lord</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he did what God required of him, obeying his commands, and thereby fulfilling all righteousness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With Israel</span>; in the fellowship of Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:6-23 The order in which the tribes are here blessed, is not the same as is observed elsewhere. The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire no more.</body></html>
