There is this difference, however, between the two blessings, that in that of the patriarch it is the growth of the tribe in power and might that is chiefly contemplated; whilst in that of Moses it is the advance of the tribe in wealth, prosperity, and influence that is chiefly indicated. "Jacob described the growth of Joseph under the figure of a luxuriant branch of a fruit tree planted by the water; whilst Moses fixes his eye primarily upon the land of Joseph, and desires for him the richest productions" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">For the precious things of heaven, for the dew</span>. Several codices, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5dc;</span>, "for <span class="accented">dew</span>," read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, above - "the precious things of heaven above;" and this reading, some critics of eminence adopt. Probably, however, this is only a correction, to bring this passage into accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>. The Targums and the Peshito combine both readings. Instead of "<span class="accented">for</span> the precious things," it is better to read "with," etc., and so throughout vers. 13-16. Literally, it is <span class="accented">from</span>, etc.; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> expressing the instrumental cause of the blessing, of which the Lord is the efficient cause. The noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>, literally, <span class="accented">excellency</span>, <span class="accented">preciousness</span>, occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-13.htm">Song of Solomon 4:13, 16</a> and Cant 7:13, where it is rendered by "pleasant." The precious fruit of the heavens is the dew, which, with the waters stored up in the recesses of the earth, furthers the growth of the earth's produce, ripened by the influences of sun and moon. <span class="cmt_word">And for the chief things of the ancient mountains</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and from the head of the mountains of old</span>. The precious things of the mountains and hills are the vines and olive trees with which the lower slopes are adorned, and the forests that crown the loftier. <span class="cmt_word">The good will of him that dwelt in the bush.</span> The reference is to the appearance of Jehovah to Moses in the bush at Horeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>.), when he manifested himself as the Deliverer of Israel, whose good pleasure it was that they should be redeemed from bondage and favored with blessing. <span class="cmt_word">That was separated from his brethren</span>; separated in the sense of <span class="accented">consecrated</span>, or <span class="accented">distinguished</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to consecrate), from among his brethren. <span class="cmt_word">His glory is like the firstling of his bullock</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the firstborn of his oxen</span>, <span class="accented">majesty is to him</span>. The singular, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, is here used collectively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-19.htm">Deuteronomy 15:19</a>. The oxen are Joseph's sons, all of whom were strong, but the firstborn excelled the rest, and was endowed with majesty. It is Ephraim that is referred to, whom Jacob raised to the position of the firstborn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-8.htm">Genesis 48:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">His horns are like the horns of unicorns</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and horns of a ream are his horns</span>. The ream is supposed to be the aurochs, an animal of the bovine species, allied to the buffalo, now extinct, but which the Assyrian bas-reliefs show to have been formerly hunted in that region (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; Rawlinson 'Anc. Men.,' 1:284).
