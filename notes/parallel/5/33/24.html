From what follows, the latter explanation seems the one <span class="accented">to</span> be preferred. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> is constantly used as indicating the source whence anything proceeds, or the agent by whom anything is done<span class="cmt_word">. Let him be acceptable to his brethren</span>; "iis e tetras suae proventibus res optimas suppeditaturus; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). <span class="accented">This</span> tribe should find itself in so advantageous and luxurious a condition that the ether tribes should have delight and pleasure in it" (Knobel). Others render, "favored among his brethren;" favored, that is, by the Lord more than his brethren (Keil). But the former seems preferable. <span class="cmt_word">And let him dip his foot in oil.</span> This points to a land abounding in olives, and generally richly fertile, a fat land and yielding rich dainties, such as Jacob promised to Asher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy shoes shall be iron and brass</span>. The word rendered "shoes" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) occurs only here. It is a derivative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, to bolt or shut fast, and is to be taken in the sense of a fastness or fortress, a place securely closed: <span class="accented">iron and brass shall be thy fortress</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his dwelling should be strong and impregnable. The rendering" shoes" is from a supposed derivation of the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, a shoe. <span class="cmt_word">As thy days, so shall thy strength be</span>; literally, as <span class="accented">thy days</span>, <span class="accented">thy rest</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as long as thou livest, so long shalt thou have rest and quiet. The noun rendered "strength" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>) in the Authorized Version. occurs only here, unless it be found in the proper name <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">Me-deba</span>), and has no Cognate in Hebrew; but the Arabic supplies a root for it in (<span class="accented">deba</span>), to rest. Furst connects it with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, and the Targum with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, to flow, and translates by "riches." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:24,25 All shall be sanctified to true believers; if their way be rough, their feet shall be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. As thy days, so shall thy strength be. The day is often in Scripture put for the events of the day; it is a promise that God would graciously and constantly support under trials and troubles, whatever they were. It is a promise sure to all the spiritual seed of Abraham. Have they work allotted? They shall have strength to do it. Have they burdens appointed? They shall have strength, and never be tempted above what they are able to bear.</body></html>
