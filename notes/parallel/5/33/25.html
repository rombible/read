The nearest word to it means "locks" or "fastenings." It is also uncertain whether the whole sentence belongs to the blessing of Asher, or to all Israel. It seems most likely that, as Asher's territory was at the northern end of Palestine, close to the pass by which the most formidable invaders must enter in, an assurance is here given that the frontier of Israel should be safe. "Iron" and "brass" are mentioned together in connection with gates and bars in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-16.htm" title="For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.">Psalm 107:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-2.htm" title="I will go before you, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:">Isaiah 45:2</a>. But they are not usually connected with "shoes" in the Old Testament.<p><span class= "bld">And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.</span>--The word for "strength" does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament, but the Targums and the LXX., and other authorities, seem to agree in its interpretation, and the form of the word points to this meaning, "strength," so that there is little doubt as to its correctness. But the meaning of the clause is variously given by Jewish authorities. "Thy strength in old ago shall be as the strength of thy youth;" or, "As thou spendest thy days (in doing the will of the Holy One or not), so shall thy strength be."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:24,25 All shall be sanctified to true believers; if their way be rough, their feet shall be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. As thy days, so shall thy strength be. The day is often in Scripture put for the events of the day; it is a promise that God would graciously and constantly support under trials and troubles, whatever they were. It is a promise sure to all the spiritual seed of Abraham. Have they work allotted? They shall have strength to do it. Have they burdens appointed? They shall have strength, and never be tempted above what they are able to bear.</body></html>
