The <span class= "ital">character of the priest </span>is the principal subject. The blessing may be thus paraphrased: "Let thy Thummim and thy Urim (the chief high-priestly ornaments) be ever with some saintly man of thine, like him whom thou (Israel) didst tempt in Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah (Moses' own departed brother Aaron is alluded to, for the people murmured against them both in both places), like him (Eleazar or Phinehas) who said to his father and to his mother, 'I have not seen him,' &c. These are the priests that shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law." The conduct of the tribe of Levi at Sinai is alluded to, when they stood by Moses and slew the idolaters. Who headed them on that occasion we are not told. Eleazar or Phinehas may be intended. The conduct of Phinehas (in Numbers 25) is also a case in point. As Rashi observes, "his father and his mother, his brethren and children" cannot be taken literally, because the tribe of Levi on the whole was faithful. The fathers, mothers, brethren, and children chiefly belonged to the other tribes.<p><span class= "bld">Let thy Thummim and thy Urim.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>. "<span class= "ital">Thy </span>Thummim and <span class= "ital">thy </span>Urim" may refer to Israel, or to Levi, or to Jehovah Himself. In the last case, He must be thought to have <span class= "ital">tried </span>Levi at Massah, and striven with Moses and Aaron at the waters of Meribah. It is not at all easy to distribute the pronouns with certainty in this speech.<p>If the writer of Deuteronomy was unconscious of any difference between priest and Levite, how is the mention of Urim and Thummim to be explained?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - The blessing on Levi is also in the form of a prayer. In Jacob's blessing, Simeon is joined with Levi, but Moses passes him over altogether, probably because, as Jacob foretold, he was to be scattered among his brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>), and so lose his tribal individuality. Simeon, however, is included in the general blessing pronounced on Israel; and as this tribe received a number of towns within the territory of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2-9</a>), it was probably regarded as included in the blessing on that tribe. <span class="cmt_word">Thy Thummim and thy Urim</span>; <span class="accented">thy Right and thy Light</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). The high priest wore the breast-plate on which these were placed when he went in before the Lord; and this is here represented as the prerogative of the whole tribe. Thy holy one; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Levi, the tribe-father, representing the whole tribe to which the blessing applies; hence in the following verses the verb passes into the plural. For "holy one," it would be better to read "pious" or "godly one;" literally, <span class="accented">the man thy pious one</span>. Some would render "the man thy favored one," or "the man of thy friendship;" but this is wholly arbitrary, the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) has no such meaning. To explain this more particularly, reference is made to the trials at <span class="cmt_word">Massah</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the waters of Meribah</span> (strife), when the people rebelled and murmured against Moses and Aaron, whereby the piety of these men was put to the test, and in them, the heads of the tribe of Levi, the whole tribe was proved. (On Massah, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>; and on the waters of strife, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>.) In these trials, Levi had proved himself faithful and godly, having risen up in defense of the honor of Jehovah, and in support of his covenant, though in the latter case both Moses and Aaron stumbled. <span class="cmt_word">Who said unto his father and to his mother</span>, etc. This refers to what is narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, when the Levites drew their swords against their brethren at the command of Moses, to execute judgment without respect of person, because of the sin of the people in the matter of the golden calf (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, and, for the principle here implicitly commended, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>). Because of their zealous devotion to the claims and service of the Lord, the dignity of the priesthood had been conferred on this tribe; and to them belonged the high office of being instructors of the people in Divine things, and of presenting the sacrifices of the people to the Lord. For those entrusted with such an office, nothing was more to be desired than that they should be blessed with power rightly to discharge the duties of their office, that their service should be accepted with favor, and that their enemies and haters should be foiled and rendered impotent; and for this Moses prays on their behalf. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:6-23 The order in which the tribes are here blessed, is not the same as is observed elsewhere. The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire no more.</body></html>
