This is generally understood of the tribes of Israel; but some would understand it of nations in general, on the ground that such is the proper meaning of the word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> and other places. A reference to nations at large, however, would seem incongruous here; and the use of the word in relation to Israel in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a>; Hoe. 10:14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10</a>, justifies the taking it so here. <span class="cmt_word">All his saints are in thy hand.</span> The people of Israel are here called God's saints, or holy ones, because they were chosen by and consecrated to him. It is not probable, as some suggest, that the angels are here intended. The change from the third person to the second is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They sat down at thy feet.</span> The verb rendered "sat down" here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) is found only in this passage, and is of uncertain meaning. Kimchi explains it as "<span class="accented">they</span> <span class="accented">united</span> or <span class="accented">assembled together to follow thy steps</span>;" Knobel makes it "they <span class="accented">wandered at thy feet</span>," and understands it of Israel's following the lead of Jehovah in the wilderness, when the ark of the covenant preceded them in their march; Gesenius and Furst, "they <span class="accented">lie down at thy feet</span>." This last is accepted by Keil, and seems to have most in its favor. <span class="cmt_word">Every one shall receive of thy words.</span> Some render here, <span class="accented">they rise up at thy words</span>; but though the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span> is sometimes used intransitively, it is properly an active verb, and there seems no reason why it should not be so regarded here: <span class="accented">every one receives</span> [the singular, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span>, used distributively] <span class="accented">thy words</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-5 To all his precepts, warnings, and prophecies, Moses added a solemn blessing. He begins with a description of the glorious appearances of God, in giving the law. His law works like fire. If received, it is melting, warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; if rejected, it hardens, sears, pains, and destroys. The Holy Spirit came down in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law. The law of God written in the heart, is a certain proof of the love of God shed abroad there: we must reckon His law one of the gifts of his grace.</body></html>
