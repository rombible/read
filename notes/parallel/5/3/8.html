By some the name is supposed to be connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, a devoted thing, because this mountain marked the limit of the country devoted or placed under a ban; and it is certainly remarkable that, at the extreme north-east and the extreme southwest of the laud conquered by the Israelites, names derived from <span class="accented">Hereto</span>, viz. <span class="accented">Hermon</span> and <span class="accented">Hormah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>), should be found; as if to indicate that all between was devoted. Hermon is the southernmost spur of the Autilibanus range. It is "the second mountain in Syria, ranking next to the highest peak of Lebanon behind the cedars. The elevation of Hermon may be estimated at about 10,000 feet. The whole body of the mountain is limestone, similar to that which composes the main ridge of Lebanon, the central peak rises up an obtuse truncated cone, from 2000 to 3000 feet above the ridges that radiate from it, thus giving it a more commanding aspect than any other mountain in Syria. This cone is entirely naked, destitute alike of trees and vegetation. The snow never disappears from its summit" (Porter, 'Handbook, Syria and Palestine,' p. 431). At the present day it is known as <span class="accented">Jebel esh-Sheikh</span> (The Chief Mountain), also <span class="accented">Jebel eth Thel</span> (The Snow Mountain). Anciently also it had various names. By the Hebrews it was known also as <span class="accented">Sion</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>, the high, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>); by the Sidonians it was called <span class="accented">Sirion</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> = <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, a cuirass or coat of mail), probably from its shining appearance, especially when covered with snow and by the Amorites it was called <span class="accented">Senir</span>, a word probably of the same meaning.
