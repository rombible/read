As <span class="accented">Geshur</span> signifies a bridge, it has been conjectured that the Geshurites were located near some well-known bridge across the Jordan, of which, perhaps, they were the keepers, and from this took their name. Maachah is called Aram (Syria) Maachah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>. According to the 'Ono-masticon,' it was "a city of the Amorites, by the Jordan, near Mount Hermon" (<span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;</span>). It had in later times a king, who allied himself with the Ammonites against David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>). These tribes were subdued, but not destroyed, by the Israelites; and at a later period seem to have regained their independence, and to have formed one kingdom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-2.htm">1 Chronicles 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair</span>.

These were recaptured by the Geshurites, aided by the Arameans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-23.htm">1 Chronicles 2:23</a>, "And Geshur and Aram took Chavvoth-Jair from them," etc.); at what time is unknown. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>, it appears that Nobah, also a family descended from Machir, took certain towns, viz. "Kenath and her daughters" in this district; these, with the twenty-three Hay-voth-Jair, made up the sixty towns which "belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-23.htm">1 Chronicles 2:23</a>). Nobah was probably in some way subordinate to Jair, and so in this rhetorical discourse, where it is not the purpose of the author to enter on minute details, the whole of these cities are included under the name Havvoth-Jair. Unto this day. "This does not necessarily imply a long time; and Moses himself may have used this expression, though only shortly after the event, in order to give prominence to the capture of the fortified cities of the giant' king Og, by the Manassites for the encouragement of the Israelites" (Herzheimer). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-20 This country was settled on the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh: see Nu 32. Moses repeats the condition of the grant to which they agreed. When at rest, we should desire to see our brethren at rest too, and should be ready to do what we can towards it; for we are not born for ourselves, but are members one of another.</body></html>
