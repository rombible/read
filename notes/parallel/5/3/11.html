(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm" title="And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,">Genesis 14:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">His bedstead.</span>--The word may mean either bedstead or coffin. Both the word for "bedstead" and the word for "iron" have given rise to some discussion and difficulty. An iron bedstead and an iron coffin are almost equally improbable. <span class= "ital">Basalt </span>has been suggested as an alternative. But though there is basalt in Argob, there is none in Rabbath-Ammon. Conder, who has recently explored Rabbath, has discovered a remarkable throne of stone on the side of a hill there, and he suggests that the Hebrew word rendered "bedstead," which properly signifies <span class= "ital">a couch with a canopy, </span>may apply to this. The word for "iron" (b<span class= "ital">arz</span>il) in Talmudical language means also "<span class= "ital">a prince," </span>and this meaning has been suggested for the name <span class= "ital">Barzillai, </span>which we find in the same district in later times. "His canopied throne was a princely one, and yet remains in Rabbath of the Ammonites," would be the meaning of the passage, on this hypothesis. The dimensions of the throne recently discovered are said to be nearly those given in this verse.<p><span class= "bld">After the cubit of a man</span>-<span class= "ital">Ish </span>(not <span class= "ital">adam</span>) the distinctive and emphatic word for a man. Some think that the cubit of <span class= "ital">any man </span>is meant; others that the man himself for whom it was made, <span class= "ital">viz., </span>Og, is intended. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-17.htm" title="And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.">Revelation 21:17</a>, "according to the measure of a man--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of an angel.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Bashan was of old possessed by a giant race, the Rephaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>); but of these Og, King of Bashan, was, at the time of the Israelitish invasion, the sole remnant. His vast size is indicated by the size of his bedstead, which was preserved in Rabbath-Ammon, perhaps as a trophy of some victory obtained by the Ammonites over their gigantic foe. This measured nine cubits in length, and four in breadth, "after the cubit of a man," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. according to the cubit in common use. Taking the cubit as equal to eighteen inches, the measure of the bedstead would be thirteen feet and a half by six feet. That Og even approximated to this height is incredible; if he reached nine or ten feet his height would exceed that of any one on record. It is probable, however, that he may have had his bed made vastly larger than himself, partly from ostentation, partly that he might leave a memorial that should impress upon posterity a sense of his gigantic size and resistless might; just as Alexander the Great is said (Died. Sic., 17:95) to have, on his march to India, caused couches to be made for his soldiers in their tents, each five cubits long, in order to impress the natives with an overwhelming sense of the greatness of his host. It has been suggested that it is not a bed that is here referred to, but a sarcophagus of basalt or ironstone in which, it is supposed, the corpse of Og was placed, and which was afterwards carried to Rabbath, and there <span class="accented">deposited</span> (J. D. Michaelis, Winer, Knobel, etc.). This implies that the passage is a later insertion, and not part of the original narrative as given by Moses. But with what view could such an insertion be introduced? Not to establish the credibility of the story of the victory of the Israelites over Og, for the existence of a sarcophagus in which a corpse had been placed would only attest the fact that such a one once lived and died, but would prove nothing as to how or when or where he came by his death. Not to show the vast size of the man, for a sarcophagus affords no measure whatever of the size of the person whose remains are placed in it, being an honorary monument, the size of which is proportioned to the real or supposed dignity of the person for whose honor it is made. A bed, on the contrary, which a man had used, or at least had caused to be made for himself, would afford some evidence of his size; and there is an obvious reason for Moses referring to this here, inasmuch as thereby he recalled-to the Israelites the remembrance, on the one hand, of what occasioned the fear with which they anticipated the approach of this terrible foe, and, on the other, of the grace of God to them in that he had delivered Og and all his people into their hand. It is idle to inquire how Moses could know of the existence of this bed at Rabbath; for we may be well assured that from all the peoples through whose territories he had passed reports of the strength and prowess and doings of this giant warrior would be poured into his ear. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Og was very powerful, but he did not take warning by the ruin of Sihon, and desire conditions of peace. He trusted his own strength, and so was hardened to his destruction. Those not awakened by the judgments of God on others, ripen for the like judgments on themselves.br></body></html>
