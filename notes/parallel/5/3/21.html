The conquest of Sihon and Og, as well as that of Amalek, was to be impressed upon Joshua (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>) as a precedent for his encouragement, and also for his instruction. It is remarkable that no details are given us of the battles against Sihon and Og, or of the capture of the cities, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-6.htm" title="Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.">Joshua 12:6</a>, "Them did Moses the servant of the Lord smite." We see the reflection of Moses' campaign, which is unwritten, in the recorded campaigns of Joshua. The peculiar form of the sentence, "<span class= "ital">Thine </span>eyes are they that see," may also serve to remind us of the fact, that though the Law was given by Moses, no eye saw its full breadth and grasp until it came into the hand of Jesus, the antitype of Joshua.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> <span class="accented">- Joshua appointed as Moses</span> <span class="accented">successor in the leadership</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. after the conquest of the land on the east of the Jordan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thine eyes have seen</span>, etc. Joshua was directed to what he had himself witnessed, what his own eyes had seen, in the destruction of Sihon and Og and their hosts, that he might be encouraged to go forward in the course to which he had been called; and the people are reminded of this, that they may keep in mind what God had done for Israel, and may without fear follow Joshua as their leader to the conquest of Canaan (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:21-29 Moses encouraged Joshua, who was to succeed him. Thus the aged and experienced in the service of God, should do all they can to strengthen the hands of those who are young, and setting out in religion. Consider what God has done, what God has promised. If God be for us, who can be against us, so as to prevail? We reproach our Leader if we follow him trembling. Moses prayed, that, if it were God's will, he might go before Israel, over Jordan into Canaan. We should never allow any desires in our hearts, which we cannot in faith offer up to God by prayer. God's answer to this prayer had a mixture of mercy and judgment. God sees it good to deny many things we desire. He may accept our prayers, yet not grant us the very things we pray for. It God does not by his providence give us what we desire, yet if by his grace he makes us content without, it comes to much the same. Let it suffice thee to have God for thy Father, and heaven for thy portion, though thou hast not every thing thou wouldst have in the world. God promised Moses a sight of Canaan from the top of Pisgah. Though he should not have the possession of it, he should have the prospect of it. Even great believers, in this present state, see heaven but at a distance. God provided him a successor. It is a comfort to the friends of the church of Christ, to see God's work likely to be carried on by others, when they are silent in the dust. And if we have the earnest and prospect of heaven, let these suffice us; let us submit to the Lord's will, and speak no more to Him of matters which he sees good to refuse us.</body></html>
