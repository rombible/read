By some the clause <span class="cmt_word">all the region of Argob</span> is connected with what precedes, while others regard this clause as in apposition with what follows. Targum: "All the region of Trachona, and all that province was called the land of giants;" LXX. "And all the region of Argob, all that Bashan: the land of the Rephaim it was reckoned:" Vulgate: "The whole region of Argob, and all Bashan is called the land of giants." Modern interpreters for the most part adopt the order of the Targum. The clause may be rendered thus: The <span class="accented">whole region of Argob as respects all Bashan</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in so far as it formed part of the kingdom of Bashan under Og] <span class="accented">was reputed the land of the Rephaim</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-20 This country was settled on the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh: see Nu 32.
