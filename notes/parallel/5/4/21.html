Take heed unto yourselves.</span>--The argument appears to be this: "I cannot go with you to warn you; therefore take the more heed when you are alone." The same line of thought appears in St. Paul's last appeal to Timothy: "Fulfil <span class= "ital">thy ministry; </span>for <span class= "ital">I am </span>now ready to be offered" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm" title="For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.">2Timothy 4:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-24.</span> - Moses, after again referring to his being not permitted to enter Canaan, takes occasion anew to warn the people against forgetting the covenant of Jehovah and making any image of God, seeing he is a jealous God, and a consuming fire. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord was angry with me... and swore</span>, etc. Neither in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>, nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12-14</a>, is there any mention of God's having <span class="accented">sworn</span> that Moses should not enter Canaan with the people; but it is absurd to suppose, as some have done, that the writer here has confounded this with what is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21, 28</a>, - that is inconceivable; and it certainly does not follow, because no mention is made in Numbers of God's having sworn, that he did not swear on this occasion; if he confirmed with an oath his decree that the generation that rebelled at Kadesh should not enter Canaan, the probability surely is that he would do the same when he announced to Moses the decree that he should not conduct Israel into the promised laud. "It is perfectly obvious, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>., that all the details are not given in the historical account of the event referred "(Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-23 The power and love of God to Israel are here made the ground and reason of a number of cautions and serious warnings; and although there is much reference to their national covenant, yet all may be applied to those who live under the gospel. What are laws made for but to be observed and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot merit salvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Considering how many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires we have in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses charges particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak the temptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretended gods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lord their God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them; shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at any time we forget our religion. Care, caution, and watchfulness, are helps against a bad memory.</body></html>
