The present introduction differs from what we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>.

Deuteronomy ver. 1; 6:1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-1.htm">Leviticus 7:1</a>, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:41-49 Here is the introduction to another discourse, or sermon, Moses preached to Israel, which we have in the following chapters. He sets the law before them, as the rule they were to work by, the way they were to walk in. He sets it before them, as the glass in which they were to see their natural face, that, looking into this perfect law of liberty, they might continue therein. These are the laws, given when Israel was newly come out of Egypt; and they were now repeated. Moses gave these laws in charge, while they encamped over against Beth-peor, an idol place of the Moabites. Their present triumphs were a powerful argument for obedience. And we should understand our own situation as sinners, and the nature of that gracious covenant to which we are invited. Therein greater things are shown to us than ever Israel saw from mount Sinai; greater mercies are given to us than they experienced in the wilderness, or in Canaan. One speaks to us, who is of infinitely greater dignity than Moses; who bare our sins upon the cross; and pleads with us by His dying love.</body></html>
