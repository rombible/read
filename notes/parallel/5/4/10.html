It is noticeable that the giving of the Law appears to have taken place about fifty days after the Passover in Egypt. Jewish writers associate the Feast of Pentecost with the memory of the event. A similar association, and a contrast between the first and last Pentecost, appears to have been present to St. Paul's mind in 2 Corinthians 3. The law given at Sinai is the "ministration of death," and is contrasted with the "ministration of the Spirit"--the letter that killeth with the Spirit that giveth life. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.">Galatians 4:24-26</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-18.htm" title="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>.) The word "specially" is not in the Hebrew of this verse.<p><span class= "bld">The day . . . in Horeb</span> is not only to be regarded as a <span class= "ital">special </span>subject of instruction; it is the root of the whole matter.<p><span class= "bld">Gather me the people together.</span>--The Greek here is <span class= "greekheb">???????????</span><span class= "ital">, </span>which might be paraphrased according to New Testament language, "Form a Church of this people," The "day of the assembly" alluded to in this and other passages (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-4.htm" title="And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>) may be similarly paraphrased as "the day of the Church." It seems to be the source of the expression used by St. Stephen, "the Church in the wilderness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>). Thus the analogy between Israel's receiving the <span class= "ital">letter </span>of the law at Sinai, and the gift of the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem is still further brought out.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Specially the day</span>. The word "specially," introduced by the translators into the Authorized Version, is a needless interpolation. With this verse begins a new sentence, which is continued in ver. 11 on to the end of ver. 13. Render, <span class="accented">On the day</span> [i.e. at the time, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, is an adverbial accusative] <span class="accented">when ye stood before Jehovah your God in Horeb</span>... <span class="accented">when ye came near and stood</span>,... <span class="accented">then Jehovah spake to you</span>, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-23 The power and love of God to Israel are here made the ground and reason of a number of cautions and serious warnings; and although there is much reference to their national covenant, yet all may be applied to those who live under the gospel. What are laws made for but to be observed and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot merit salvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Considering how many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires we have in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses charges particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak the temptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretended gods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lord their God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them; shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at any time we forget our religion. Care, caution, and watchfulness, are helps against a bad memory.</body></html>
