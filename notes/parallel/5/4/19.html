But Jehovah was pledged to be the God of Israel. This appears to be the argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deuteronomy 4:19-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven</span>, etc. The worship of the heavenly bodies, especially star-worship, prevailed among the Canaanites and many of the Semitic tribes, but was not confined to them; the Egyptians also reverenced the sun as Re, the moon as Isis, and the stars as the symbols of deities. The Israelites were thus, both from past associations and from what they might encounter in Canaan, exposed to the danger of being seduced into idolatry. <span class="cmt_word">Shouldest be driven</span>: <span class="accented">shouldest be urged on</span>, <span class="accented">drawn</span>, or <span class="accented">constrained</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven</span>, God had allotted (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>) to all mankind the heavenly bodies for their advantage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-19.htm">Psalm 104:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>); it was, therefore, not competent for any one nation to seek to appropriate them as specially theirs, and it was absurd for any to offer religious service to objects intended for the service of man. Targum: <span class="accented">Which the Lord thy God prepared for all peoples under heaven</span>; Vulgate: <span class="accented">Quae creavit Dominus Deus tuus in ministerium cunctis gentibus</span>. This seems better than the interpretation that God had "allotted them for worship, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. had permitted them [the nations] to choose them as the objects of their worship" (Keil, etc.); for: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> There is no distinction here between the Hebrews and the other nations of the earth; "all nations" includes them as well as the heathen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Though God permitted the heathen to worship the heavenly bodies, he never allotted these to men in order that they might worship them. "It noteth God's bounty in giving all people the use of those creatures, and the base mind of man to worship such things as are given for servants unto men" (Ainsworth). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-23 The power and love of God to Israel are here made the ground and reason of a number of cautions and serious warnings; and although there is much reference to their national covenant, yet all may be applied to those who live under the gospel. What are laws made for but to be observed and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot merit salvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Considering how many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires we have in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses charges particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak the temptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretended gods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lord their God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them; shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at any time we forget our religion. Care, caution, and watchfulness, are helps against a bad memory.</body></html>
