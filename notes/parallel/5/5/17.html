In the enactments of the second table there is a progression from the outward to the inward. First, sins of <span class="accented">deed</span> are prohibited, such as murder, adultery, and theft; then sins of <span class="accented">word</span>, such as injury of a neighbor's good name by false testimony; and finally, sins of <span class="accented">the heart</span>, which do not come into open manifestation, such as covetousness and evil desire. The "commandment" is thus seen to be" exceeding broad" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-96.htm">Psalm 119:96</a>). So that only the man "who hath clean hands and a pure heart, and who hath not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully," shall "ascend into the hill of the Lord, or stand in his holy place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8, 4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-22 There is some variation here from Ex 20 as between the Lord's prayer in Mt 6 and Lu 11. It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul truly distressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild and soul-reviving language of the gospel!</body></html>
