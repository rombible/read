The introduction and the close of the command, which gives the reason for it, are different here. The reason drawn from the creation is not mentioned; the reason drawn from the exodus is. This fact illustrates the observation that in Deuteronomy we find "the Gospel of the Pentateuch." If for the exodus of Israel we substitute here "the exodus of Christ, which He accomplished at Jerusalem," not so much by His <span class= "ital">death as by His resurrection, </span>we have a reason for keeping <span class= "ital">not the Sabbath, but the Lord's Day.</span><p>It is worth while to observe that the Israelites had express authority given them to <span class= "ital">enforce the observance of the Sabbath upon Gentiles, </span>when these could be regarded as "strangers within their gates." The words <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-6.htm" title="Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and takes hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:6</a> seem to show that "strangers" who "took hold of the covenant" of Jehovah were expected to "keep His sabbath from polluting it." For an example of its enforcement, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-16.htm" title="There dwelled men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/13-20.htm" title="So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.">Nehemiah 13:20-21</a>.<p>If any difficulty is felt at the variation of the form of the commandment from that which we have in Exodus, it should be observed, first, that the <span class= "ital">command itself is not altered, </span>as appears by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/5-13.htm" title="Six days you shall labor, and do all your work:">Deuteronomy 5:13-14</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-9.htm" title="Six days shall you labor, and do all your work:">Exodus 20:9-10</a>; and secondly, that in this exhortation Moses calls Israel to hear the statutes and judgments which he, as their mediator, commands them, and that he is free to enforce them by such reasons as may seem to him best.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.</span> This phraseology implies that the Sabbath institute was already well known to the people of Israel; so that this commandment was intended, not to enact a new observance, but to enforce the continuance of an observance which had come down to them from earlier times. The Sabbath was to be kept by being <span class="accented">sanctified</span>. This means that it was to be consecrated to God to be used as he had appointed. The sanctification of any object "always goes back to an act of the Divine will, to Divine election and institution. In other words, it is always a state in which the creature [or institute] is bound to God by the appointment of God himself, which is expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, XXX" (Oehler, 'Theology of the Old Testament,' vol. 1. p. 155). The sanctification of the Sabbath, accordingly, was the consecration of that day to the Lord, to be observed as he had enjoined, that is, as a day of rest from all servile work and ordinary occupations. Among the Jews, those who were careful to keep this law "rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-56.htm">Luke 23:56</a>). Not, however, in mere indolence and idle vacancy, unworthy of a man. Not thus could the day be sanctified to the Lord. Man had to "release his soul and body from all their burdens, with all the professions and pursuits of ordinary life, only in order to gather himself together again in God with greater purity and fewer disturbing elements, and renew in him the might of his own better powers" (Ewald, 'Antiquities of Israel,' p. 102). In the Sabbath institute, therefore, lies the basis of spiritual worship and pious service in Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-22 There is some variation here from Ex 20 as between the Lord's prayer in Mt 6 and Lu 11. It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul truly distressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild and soul-reviving language of the gospel!</body></html>
