The promise of His presence with us through the "other Comforter" compensates for the absence of any visible image. As <span class= "ital">love </span>in this verse is practical, so is <span class= "ital">hatred </span>in the previous verse. To hate God is to disobey His commandments.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-22 There is some variation here from Ex 20 as between the Lord's prayer in Mt 6 and Lu 11. It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul truly distressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild and soul-reviving language of the gospel!</body></html>
