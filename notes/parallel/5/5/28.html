It will appear by comparison of the two passages that the promise of the prophet like unto Moses was given at this very time: "They have well said all that they have spoken. I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in His mouth." It is not a little remarkable that He who gave the Law from Sinai "in blackness and darkness and tempest" should, on that very day, acknowledge the need of a different form of teaching for His people, and should promise it then and there. But it must not be forgotten that He "whose voice then shook the earth" is the very same Person who "speaketh from heaven" now. He who pronounced the Law in the letter writes it on the heart by His Spirit. The Angel of the covenant and the Prophet like unto Moses are one. He who gave the Law on Sinai died under it on Calvary, and provided for its observance for ever.<p>(29) <span class= "bld">O that there were such an heart in them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Who will give that there shall be this heart in them, to fear me, and to keep all my commandments all the days? </span>He who asked the question has also supplied the, answer: "<span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">will put </span>my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them." Or, more exactly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm" title="For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:">Hebrews 8:10</a>, "<span class= "ital">Giving </span>my laws into their understanding, <span class= "ital">I will also write them </span>upon their hearts." The need of a Mediator like themselves was well stated by the people; it was also met by Him who said, "They have well said all that they have spoken."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - The words of God in reply to those of the people are not given in Exodus; here they are fittingly inserted God approved of their words because they expressed a proper reverence and m due sense on their part of the unworthiness of sinful men to come into the presence of the great and holy God; but knowing their fickleness, and proneness to forget and depart from him, he added, <span class="cmt_word">Oh that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always!</span> God looks upon the heart, and will accept no service or worship that is not rendered from the heart. Only they who do his will from the heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>) really fear and keep his commandments. The tongue may sometimes promise what the heart does not guarantee; and so when the occasion that provoked the utterance has passed, the whole may be forgotten, and the promise never be fulfilled. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:23-33 Moses refers to the consternation caused by the terror with which the law was given. God's appearances have always been terrible to man, ever since the fall; but Christ, having taken away sin, invites us to come boldly to the throne of grace. They were in a good mind, under the strong convictions of the word they heard. Many have their consciences startled by the law who have them not purified; fair promises are extorted from them, but no good principles are fixed and rooted in them. God commended what they said. He desires the welfare and salvation of poor sinners. He has given abundant proof that he does so; he gives us time and space to repent. He has sent his Son to redeem us, promised his Spirit to those who pray for him, and has declared that he has no pleasure in the ruin of sinners. It would be well with many, if there were always such a heart in them, as there seems to be sometimes; when they are under conviction of sin, or the rebukes of providence, or when they come to look death in the face. The only way to be happy, is to be holy. Say to the righteous, It shall be well with them. Let believers make it more and more their study and delight, to do as the Lord God hath commanded.</body></html>
