But it is not wholly fulfilled yet. "If the fall of God's people was the wealth of the world . . . what will the receiving of them be. but life from the dead?" (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm" title="For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?">Romans 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm" title="And again he said, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.">Romans 15:10</a>.)<p><span class= "note">[9] The LXX. have a longer version of this verse, "Rejoice, ye heavens, with Him, and <span class= "ital">let all the angels of God worship Him </span>(</span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a><span class= "note">); Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with His people, and let all the sons of God be strong in Him; for," &c.</span><p><span class= "bld">And will be merciful unto.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">will reconcile or make atonement for His land, the land of His people, </span>or <span class= "ital">for the land of His people. </span>He will cleanse, forgive, and be merciful to it.

Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people. The Authorized Version here follows the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, and so St. Paul cites the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm">Romans 15:10</a>. The Jewish interpreters generally render, <span class="accented">Praise his people</span>, <span class="accented">O nations</span>; and this several Christian interpreters adopt. But as Rosenm&uuml;ller remarks, it is the Divine righteousness manifested in the vindication of his people from their enemies that is to be celebrated, and not the people themselves, as what follows shows. Here as elsewhere the <span class="accented">nations</span> and the <span class="accented">people</span> are in contrast. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:39-43 This conclusion of the song speaks, 1. Glory to God. No escape can be made from his power. 2. It speaks terror to his enemies. Terror indeed to those who hate him. The wrath of God is here revealed from heaven against them. 3. It speaks comfort to his own people. The song concludes with words of joy. Whatever judgments are brought upon sinners, it shall go well with the people of God.</body></html>
