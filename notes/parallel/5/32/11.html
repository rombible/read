But beautiful as the simile and the description in these places are, they are surpassed in gentleness by our Saviour when He says, "How often would I have gathered thy children together, <span class= "ital">as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, </span>and ye would not" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-34.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kill the prophets, and stone them that are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and you would not!">Luke 13:34</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Fluttereth.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">broodeth, </span>is the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm" title="And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep.

"<span class= "ital">He maketh </span>him to ride," &c.,<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - God's treatment of his people is compared to that of an eagle towards its young (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>). In the Authorized Version, the apodosis of the sentence is made to begin at ver. 12, and ver. 11 is wholly understood of the eagle and its young. To this arrangement it has been objected that it overlooks the fact that the suffixes to the verbs "taketh" and "beareth" are singulars, and are to be understood consequently, not of the eaglets, but of Israel. It has, therefore, been proposed to render the passage thus: <span class="accented">As an eagle which stirreth up its nest</span>, <span class="accented">fluttereth over its young</span>, <span class="accented">he spread out his wings</span>, <span class="accented">took him up</span>, <span class="accented">and carried him on his pinions</span>. <span class="accented">The Lord alone did lead him</span>, etc. The comparison is thus made to pass into a metaphorical representation of the Lord's dealing with Israel. One feels that there is something violent in this, for whilst God's care for Israel might be fittingly <span class="accented">compared to</span> that of an eagle towards her young, it is less fit to speak of God himself as if he <span class="accented">were</span> an eagle with wings which he spread abroad and on which he bare Israel. The rendering in the Authorized Version is on this account to be preferred, if it can be grammatically vindicated. And this it may on the ground that the suffixes may be understood of the "nest" as containing the young ("continens pro contento," a common rhetorical trope in Scripture; see Glass., 'Philippians Sac.,' p. 686; cf. Virgil, 'AEneid,' 12:475, "nidisque loquacibus escam"); or the young may be referred to individually, "taketh it, beareth it," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. each of them; or, if the nest be understood, the whole body of them as therein contained. <span class="cmt_word">Stirreth up her</span> [its] <span class="cmt_word">nest</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. its nestlings; <span class="accented">provocans ad</span> <span class="accented">volandum pullos suos</span>, <span class="accented">Vulgate</span>. This is the explanation usually given of the initial clause of this verse; but its accuracy has been questioned, Furst would render the verb by "watchesover; "but though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, as the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to watch, may have this meaning, it is undoubtedly used generally in the sense of rousing, exciting, stirring up. Knobel retains this meaning, but understands the clause of the exciting of the nestlings by the parent bird coming to them with food. This is certainly more in keeping with what follows; for when the eagle nestles or broods over her young, she does not excite them to fly. <span class="cmt_word">Fluttereth over her young</span>; rather, <span class="accented">broods over</span>, <span class="accented">nestles</span>, or <span class="accented">cherishes</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Spreadeth abroad her wings,</span> etc. "I once saw a very interesting sight above one of the crags of Ben Nevis, as I was going in pursuit of black game. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of a mountain, in the eye of the sun; - it was about midday, and bright for this climate. They at first made small circles, and the young imitated them; they paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their first flight, holding them on their expanded wings when they appeared exhausted, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising towards the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight, so as to make a gradually ascending spiral" (Davy, 'Salinertia;' see also Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 2:181). The general reference is to God's fostering care of Israel, and especially his dealing with them when "he suffered their manners in the wilderness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-18.htm">Acts 13:18</a>), disciplined them, and trained them for what they were appointed to do. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:7-14 Moses gives particular instances of God's kindness and concern for them. The eagle's care for her young is a beautiful emblem of Christ's love, who came between Divine justice and our guilty souls, and bare our sins in his own body on the tree. And by the preached gospel, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, He stirs up and prevails upon sinners to leave Satan's bondage. In ver. 13,14, are emblems of the conquest believers have over their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, and the world, in and through Christ. Also of their safety and triumph in him; of their happy frames of soul, when they are above the world, and the things of it. This will be the blessed case of spiritual Israel in every sense in the latter day.</body></html>
