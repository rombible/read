The verb here is the Hiph, of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to breathe, to blow, and is found only here. The rabbins make it a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, a corner, and this the Authorized Version follows; others trace it to an Arabic root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">amputavit</span>, <span class="accented">excidit</span>, and render, "will cut them off." The idea intended to be conveyed is obviously that of entire destruction, and this is not satisfied by the representation of their being scared or driven into corners. <span class="cmt_word">Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy.</span> Various renderings and interpretations of this passage have been given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that I should be provoked to wrath by the enemy ascribing the destruction of Israel to their own prowess. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">Were it not that I feared a wrath upon the enemy</span>, with much the same meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="accented">Were it not that I feared the fury of the enemy</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. against Israel - feared lest the enemy should be encouraged to rise up against Israel and ascribe their destruction to their own valor. Of these that most generally approved is the first. (On this reason for sparing Israel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13, 14</a>.) Should behave themselves strangely; rather, <span class="accented">should mistake</span> or <span class="accented">falsely pretend</span>. The verb is the Piel of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to look upon, to mark, and conveys the idea of looking on askance or prejudicially, hence being ignorant of, mistaking, feigning, or falsely pretending. Our hand is high; rather, <span class="accented">was high</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. was mighty in power. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers 28-33.</span> - The cause of Israel's rejection was that they were a people utterly destitute of counsel and without understanding. Had they been wise, they would have looked to the end, and acted in a way conducive to their own welfare, instead of rushing upon ruin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:26-38 The idolatry and rebellions of Israel deserved, and the justice of God seemed to demand, that they should be rooted out. But He spared Israel, and continues them still to be living witnesses of the truth of the Bible, and to silence unbelievers. They are preserved for wise and holy purposes and the prophecies give us some idea what those purposes are. The Lord will never disgrace the throne of his glory. It is great wisdom, and will help much to the return of sinners to God, seriously to consider their latter end, or the future state. It is here meant particularly of what God foretold by Moses, about this people in the latter days; but it may be applied generally. Oh that men would consider the happiness they will lose, and the misery they will certainly plunge into, if they go on in their trespasses! What will be in the end thereof? Jer 5:31. For the Lord will in due time bring down the enemies of the church, in displeasure against their wickedness. When sinners deem themselves most secure, they suddenly fall into destruction. And God's time to appear for the deliverance of his people, is when things are at the worst with them. But those who trust to any rock but God, will find it fail them when they most need it. The rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish nation, is the continuance of their ancient idolatry, apostacy, and rebellion. They shall be brought to humble themselves before the Lord, to repent of their sins, and to trust in their long-rejected Mediator for salvation. Then he will deliver them, and make their prosperity great.</body></html>
