The expression in the second clause is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm" title="Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.">Psalm 90:2</a> (a prayer of Moses), "Before the mountains were brought forth, while Thou wast yet <span class= "ital">in travail with </span>earth and world, and from eternity unto eternity Thou art God!" The word which I have rendered "forgetful" is usually taken as a verb. But the <span class= "ital">verb </span>is not found elsewhere (i.e., it is invented for the sake of this passage), and the word may not impossibly be an adjective.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Moses here returns to the thought of ver. 15, for the purpose of expressing it with greater force, and also of leading on to the description he is about to give of the Lord's acts towards the nation who had so revolted from him. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art unmindful</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">dereliquisti</span>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> occurs only here, and the meaning is doubtful. From the rendering of the versions, it would seem to be allied to the Arabic , <span class="accented">saha</span>, <span class="accented">oblitus est</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That formed thee</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that brought thee forth</span> or <span class="accented">caused thee to be born</span>; "qui te eduxit ex utero materno" (Jarchi. Cf. for the use of the verb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-9.htm">Psalm 29:9</a>). In the Samaritan Codex, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d4;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, "who hath glorified or praised thee," is the reading, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>; and this the Syriac also expresses. The other versions, however, support the Masoretic reading. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:15-18 Here are two instances of the wickedness of Israel, each was apostacy from God. These people were called Jeshurun, an upright people, so some; a seeing people, so others: but they soon lost the reputation both of their knowledge and of their righteousness. They indulged their appetites, as if they had nothing to do but to make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it. Those who make a god of themselves, and a god of their bellies, in pride and wantonness, and cannot bear to be told of it, thereby forsake God, and show they esteem him lightly. There is but one way of a sinner's acceptance and sanctification, however different modes of irreligion, or false religion, may show that favourable regard for other ways, which is often miscalled candid. How mad are idolaters, who forsake the Rock of salvation, to run themselves upon the rock of perdition!</body></html>
