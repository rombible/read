Concerning Jacob, that "<span class= "ital">He found him </span>in Bethel," when Jacob said "Surely the Lord is in this place, <span class= "ital">and I knew it not</span>" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm" title="Yes, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us;">Hosea 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-16.htm" title="And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.">Genesis 28:16</a>). A series of similar passages is closed by the three examples of the lost sheep, the lost money, and the son that had been lost, and <span class= "ital">was found </span>(Luke 15).<p><span class= "bld">He led him about.</span>--The commoner meaning is given in the margin. Rashi has this remark: "He caused them to abide round about His glory (<span class= "ital">Shechinah</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the tent of the congregation in the middle, and four standards on the four sides."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - God's fatherly care of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">In the desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the land of the desert</span>, <span class="accented">in the waste</span> (the formless waste; the word used is that rendered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, "without form"), <span class="accented">the howling of the wilderness</span>. "Israel is figuratively represented as a man without food or water, and surrounded by howling, ferocious beasts, and who must needs have perished had not God found him and rescued him" (Herxheimer). <span class="cmt_word">The apple of his eye</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the mannikin</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of his eye, the pupil; so called because in it, as in a mirror, a person sees his own image reflected in miniature (Gesenius), or because, being the tenderest part of the eye, it is guarded as one would a babe (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-2.htm">Proverbs 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>). By Delitzsch and others this explanation of the word is rejected as not philologically justified, there being no evidence that the termination <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> had a diminutive force; and as not in keeping with the earnestness of the passages in which this word occurs. They prefer the explanation <span class="accented">man image</span> to <span class="accented">mannikin</span>. Anyhow, the use of the word here must be taken as indicating that Israel is ever in the eye of the Lord, the object of his constant and tenderest care. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:7-14 Moses gives particular instances of God's kindness and concern for them. The eagle's care for her young is a beautiful emblem of Christ's love, who came between Divine justice and our guilty souls, and bare our sins in his own body on the tree. And by the preached gospel, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, He stirs up and prevails upon sinners to leave Satan's bondage. In ver. 13,14, are emblems of the conquest believers have over their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, and the world, in and through Christ. Also of their safety and triumph in him; of their happy frames of soul, when they are above the world, and the things of it. This will be the blessed case of spiritual Israel in every sense in the latter day.</body></html>
