His name was apparently changed to Joshua at the time when he entered the promised land with the eleven others who searched it out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-8.htm" title="Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.">Numbers 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm" title="These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.">Numbers 13:16</a>). Now that he is about to lead Israel to the conquest, we are once more reminded of his change of name, and that the "salvation of Jehovah" was to be manifested through him. Possibly the change of name was also at this time confirmed to him. Compare the case of Jacob, whose change of name to Israel was <span class= "ital">twice </span>made the subject of a Divine communication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm" title="And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.">Genesis 32:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm" title="And God said to him, Your name is Jacob: your name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be your name: and he called his name Israel.">Genesis 35:10</a>). Compare also what was said to him when about to enter into Egypt: "God spake unto <span class= "ital">Israel </span>in the visions of the night, and said, <span class= "ital">Jacob, Jacob."</span><p>We are assured by the mention of Hoshea in this place that the Joshua appointed to succeed Moses is the same person who was faithful among the spies.<p>It is also possible that this mention of Hoshea may be Joshua's <span class= "ital">first mention of himself in the sacred writings. </span>After the close of the song, the remainder of Deuteronomy is not covered by Moses' signature. It belongs to Joshua, or else the author is unknown.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-47.</span> - Moses, having composed this song, came, accompanied by Joshua, and they together spoke it in the hearing of the people; after which Moses took occasion to urge upon them anew the importance of keeping the commandments of God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hoshea the son of Nun.</span> Moses invariably writes this name <span class="accented">Jehoshuah</span> (Jehovah is help; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-3.htm">Deuteronomy 31:3, 7, 14, 20</a>, etc.). The use of Hoshea here is due to the fact that this account is part of the supplement added by another writer to the writing of Moses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:44-47 Here is the solemn delivery of this song to Israel, with a charge to mind all the good words Moses had said unto them.

Oh that men were fully persuaded that religion is their life, even the life of their souls!</body></html>
