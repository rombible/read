and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you know not: for you have kindled a fire in my anger, which shall burn for ever.">Jeremiah 17:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The foundations of the mountains.</span>--Rashi says, "Jerusalem, which is founded on the mountains," as it is said, "Jerusalem, the mountains are about her" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm" title="As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.">Psalm 125:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-14.htm">Jeremiah 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-11.htm">Lamentations 4:11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The lowest hell</span>; <span class="accented">the lowest sheol</span>, the uttermost depth of the under-world. The Hebrew <span class="accented">sheol</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) answering to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, by which it is usually rendered by the LXX., is a general designation of the unseen state, the place of the dead. By some the word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, to ask, because <span class="accented">sheol</span> is ever asking, is insatiable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a>); but more probably it is from a root signifying to excavate, to hollow, and, like the German <span class="accented">holle</span>, means primarily a hollow place or cavern. The Divine wrath kindles a consuming fire, that burns down to the lowest depths - to the deepest part of <span class="accented">sheol -</span> consumes the earth's produce, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. This does not refer to any particular judgment that was to befall the national Israel, but is a general description of the effects of the Divine wrath when that is poured forth in judgments on men. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:19-25 The revolt of Israel was described in the foregoing verses, and here follow the resolves of Divine justice as to them. We deceive ourselves, if we think that God will be mocked by a faithless people. Sin makes us hateful in the sight of the holy God. See what mischief sin does, and reckon those to be fools that mock at it.</body></html>
