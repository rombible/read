This is the character of <span class= "ital">the Rock. </span>This name of God ( <span class= "ital">Tzur</span>) is one of the characteristics of the song. The word occurs first in Exodus 17, where the Rock in Horeb was smitten; "and that Rock was Christ." From that time we find that the very names of the leaders in Israel embody this confession. <span class= "ital">Elizur, </span>my God is a Rock; Zurishaddai, the Almighty is my Rock; and Pedahzur, redeemed by the Rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/1-5.htm" title="And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.">Numbers 1:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-10.htm" title="Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim; Elishama the son of Ammihud: of Manasseh; Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.">Numbers 1:10</a>), are examples. So exclusively is the term in Hebrew (<span class= "ital">Tz-r </span>or <span class= "ital">Selagh</span>) used in this sense, that no <span class= "ital">man </span>is ever described by it in the Old Testament. And the LXX., in this song and in many other places, do not translate it at all, but give it as <span class= "ital">God </span>(<span class= "greekheb">????</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>In other places the word <span class= "ital">Petra </span>(never Petros) is employed. This fact convinces me that the Petra of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a> could only have been understood by Jews as denoting Deity; and that it not only referred to Christ, but to <span class= "ital">Christ as God. </span>No other interpretation will suit the language of Holy Scripture. This fourth verse, like the third, is a stanza of four lines. The first line is answered by the third, and the second line by the fourth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is the Rock, his work is</span> <span class="cmt_word">perfect</span>; rather, <span class="accented">The Rock! his work is perfect</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. blameless, without fault. God is called "the Rock" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>), as the unchangeable Refuge and Stronghold of his people, by which they are sustained, and to which they can resort for defense and protection at all times. The epithet is applied to God four times besides in this song (vers. 15, 18, 30, 31); it occurs also frequently in the Psalms (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2, 7</a>; etc.). The Hebrew word, <span class="accented">tsur</span>, <span class="accented">gut</span>, or <span class="accented">zur</span>, appears in several proper names of the Mosaic period, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">Pedahzur</span>, "Rock delivers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>), a name of the same import as <span class="accented">Pedahel</span>, "God delivers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-28.htm">Numbers 34:28</a>); <span class="accented">Elizur</span>, "God is a Rock" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5</a>); <span class="accented">Zuriel</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-35.htm">Numbers 3:35</a>) and <span class="accented">Zurishaddai</span>, "the Almighty is Rock" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-6.htm">Numbers 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-12.htm">Numbers 2:12</a>). "Jehovah," says Baumgarten, "is here called <span class="accented">Rock</span>, without any qualification, the reason is that he is the only true rock, and all the strength and firmness of earth's stones is but an ectype of his unchangeable faithfulness and rectitude. If one cleaves to the dualism of spirit and nature, and regards the figure as a merely subjective, arbitrary union of the two, such an expression is simply unintelligible; but if we would understand Scripture and religious speech, we must with all earnestness accustom ourselves to recognize the spiritual ground in nature, and apprehend this in the Biblical expression (comp. Steffens' 'Religionsphilosophie,' 1. s. 101, 102)." It is remarkable that none of the ancient versions have retained this epithet here. The LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dens</span> ("Dei opera"); the Targum of Onkelos, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, "Mighty;" while the Peshito has simply the pronoun "his" appended to "works," . <span class="cmt_word">For all his ways are judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. accordant with rectitude (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A God of truth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of faithfulness</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, to stay, or be stayed, to be firm). <span class="cmt_word">They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</span> Of this difficult passage the following seems the best construction and rendering: - <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">perverse and crooked generation not his children</span>, [but] <span class="accented">their spot - has become corrupt towards him</span>. The subject of the verb at the beginning of the verse is the "perverse and crooked generation," at the end of it, and between the verb and its subject there is interjected parenthetically the clause, "not his children, but their spot." <span class="accented">Spot</span> is here used in a moral sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>. These corrupt persons claimed to be children of God, but they were not; they were rather a stain and a reproach to them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). The rendering above given is substantially that of De Wette, Knobel, Keil, and Herxheimer, by all of whom the "perverse generation "is regarded as the subject of the sentence. This is the view adopted also in the 'Speaker's Commentary.' Some would make "God" the subject, and render, "He hath corrupted to him, or to himself" (margin, Authorized Version; Ibn Ezra, etc.). Others take "spot" as the subject, thus: "Their spot or blemish hath corrupted before him children not his" (Lowth, Dathe); but such renderings are forced, and proceed on constructions of the text which are illegitimate. Donaldson ('Jashar,' pp. 186, 223, edit. See.), following Lowth's construction, appeals to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (ver. 20) as a similar inversion. But the two cases are not parallel. To make them so, we must have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, "his children in whom is no spot." Ewald takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> as the noun here, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, and tracing it to the Syriac , <span class="accented">juravit</span>, renders "to him they, his not sons, have corrupted their oath," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. have broken it; and this Furst approves. But the phrase, "to corrupt an oath" is unexampled in the Old Testament, and there is no ground for changing the noun. The ancient versions vary considerably here: LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>: Aq., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: Sym., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">peccaverunt ei et non filii ejus in sordibus</span>; Ver. Itala., <span class="accented">peeca verunt non ei filii maculati</span>; Syriac, "They corrupted but not him, children of defilement." These various renderings indicate that probably the text is and has long been corrupt. Some of the older English versions are worth noting on this verse. Rogers [Matthew], "The frowarde and overthwart generation hath marred them selves to himward, and are not his sonnes for their deformitie's sake;" Bishop's Bible, "Frowardly have they done agaynst him by their vices, not being his own children, but a wicked and froward generation;" Geneva Version, "They have corrupted themselves towards him by their vice, not being his children, but a froward and crooked generation." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:3-6 He is a Rock. This is the first time God is called so in Scripture. The expression denotes that the Divine power, faithfulness, and love, as revealed in Christ and the gospel, form a foundation which cannot be changed or moved, on which we may build our hopes of happiness. And under his protection we may find refuge from all our enemies, and in all our troubles; as the rocks in those countries sheltered from the burning rays of the sun, and from tempests, or were fortresses from the enemy. His work is perfect: that of redemption and salvation, in which there is a display of all the Divine perfection, complete in all its parts. All God's dealings with his creatures are regulated by wisdom which cannot err, and perfect justice. He is indeed just and right; he takes care that none shall lose by him. A high charge is exhibited against Israel. Even God's children have their spots, while in this imperfect state; for if we say we have no sin, no spot, we deceive ourselves. But the sin of Israel was not habitual, notorious, unrepented sin; which is a certain mark of the children of Satan. They were fools to forsake their mercies for lying vanities. All wilful sinners, especially sinners in Israel, are unwise and ungrateful.</body></html>
