Either "the child of the upright," or "the beloved Israel." The letters of the diminutive of Israel, if slightly abbreviated, would make "Jeshurun." It is peculiar to Deuteronomy (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-5.htm" title="And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm" title="There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb, which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and you, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.">Isaiah 44:2</a>). Two of the Targums render the word by "Israel here." The third retains the word itself. The LXX. translate it "the beloved one."<p><span class= "bld">Kicked.</span>--Only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-29.htm" title="Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?">1Samuel 2:29</a> : "Wherefore <span class= "ital">kick</span> <span class= "ital">ye </span>at my sacrifice and mine offering . . . <span class= "ital">to make</span> <span class= "ital">yourselves fat?"</span><p><span class= "bld">Grown thick.</span>--As Rehoboam said, "My little finger shall <span class= "ital">be thicker </span>than my father's loins." Both these parallels illustrate the spirit of the verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-18.</span> - Israel's ungrateful return for the Lord's benefits. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jeshurun</span>. This name, formed from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, righteous, designates Israel as chosen to be a righteous nation; and in the use of it here lies the keenest reproach of apostate Israel, as fallen into a state the opposite of that to which it was destined. "By using the name <span class="accented">righteous</span> in place of <span class="accented">Israel</span>, Moses ironically censures those who had swerved from rectitude; by recalling to memory with what dignity they had been endowed, he the more sharply rebukes the perfidy which was their crime" (Calvin). This name appears also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5, 26</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>; but in these places without any implied censure. By some the word is regarded as a diminutive from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, in the sense of <span class="accented">rectulus</span>, <span class="accented">justulus</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> good little people" (Gesenius); others as a diminutive from XXX, Israel, as a sort of term of endearment (Grotius). But the latter of these derivations is impossible; and as to the former, there lacks evidence of the termination <span class="accented">un</span> having a diminutive significance in Hebrew. Besides, neither here nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a> would a term of endearment be suitable. <span class="cmt_word">Waxed fat, and kicked</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>). The allusion is to an ox that had grown fat through good feeding, and had become unmanageable in consequence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lightly esteemed</span>. The Hebrew is strongly expressive here: Thou <span class="accented">hast treated as a fool</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> to be foolish (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:15-18 Here are two instances of the wickedness of Israel, each was apostacy from God. These people were called Jeshurun, an upright people, so some; a seeing people, so others: but they soon lost the reputation both of their knowledge and of their righteousness. They indulged their appetites, as if they had nothing to do but to make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it. Those who make a god of themselves, and a god of their bellies, in pride and wantonness, and cannot bear to be told of it, thereby forsake God, and show they esteem him lightly. There is but one way of a sinner's acceptance and sanctification, however different modes of irreligion, or false religion, may show that favourable regard for other ways, which is often miscalled candid. How mad are idolaters, who forsake the Rock of salvation, to run themselves upon the rock of perdition!</body></html>
