Everything that comes down from the "Father of lights" is handed on by one heavenly messenger to another, until it falls upon the heart of man, in just that form in which he can best receive it. The Son of God says," My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me." "I speak that which I have seen with my Father." Of the Holy Spirit He says, "He shall <span class= "ital">receive of Mine </span>and shall show it unto you." The apostles speak "in words which the Holy Ghost teacheth." The parallels of the verse appear to be these:--My learning shall drop as the <span class= "ital">rain; </span>My speech shall distil as the <span class= "ital">dew, </span>as the <span class= "ital">sweeping showers </span>upon the tender herb, as the <span class= "ital">multitude of drops </span>upon the grass. The "small rain" of the Authorised Version points to a different and probably untenable derivation of the Hebrew word. The <span class= "ital">rain </span>is more definite than the dew, and therefore the first word in the second half of the verse should be stronger than the second, and not <span class= "ital">vice versa. </span>The <span class= "ital">tender herb </span>just sprouting can bear heavier showers than the grown grass.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My doctrine shall drop as the rain.</span> The Hebrew verb here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a> is properly rendered by" drop;" it expresses the gentle falling of a genial shower or the soft distillation of dew. The clause is best taken imperatively, as it is by the LXX., the Vulgate, and Onkelos: <span class="accented">Let</span> <span class="accented">my doctrine drop as the rain</span>, <span class="accented">let my speech distil</span>, etc. The point of comparison here is not the quickening, fructifying, vivifying influence of the rain and dew, so much as the effective force of these agents as sent from heaven to produce results.
