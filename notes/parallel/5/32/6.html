Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's Hebrew 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>6<span class= "note">)</span>"It is Jehovah that ye requite thus!<p>A people foolish and unwise!<p>Is not He thy Father that hath gotten thee?<p>He made thee and establisheth thee."<p>The first line is an exclamatory question. A question and an exclamation have the same name in the Rabbinical writings. "Hath gotten" in the third line is the same expression which Eve used (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm" title="And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.">Genesis 4:1</a>) at the birth of Cain, and occurs also in that magnificent saying in the history of Wisdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.">Proverbs 8:22</a>, "The Lord <span class= "ital">begat </span>me (as) the beginning of his way."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - Instead of gratefully acknowledging the Divine beneficence, and dutifully obeying the Divine will, Israel had perversely and foolishly requited the Lord for all his benefits, by apostasy from him. <span class="cmt_word">Do ye thus requite?</span> The verb here signifies primarily to do to any one either good or evil, whether in return for what he has done or not (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-15.htm">Genesis 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-18.htm">1 Samuel 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-30.htm">Proverbs 3:30</a>); then, as a secondary meaning, to reward, repay, requite, as here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-21.htm">Psalm 18:21</a>. To bring more forcibly to their view the ingratitude and folly of their conduct, Moses dwells upon what God was and had been to the nation: their <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>, in that he had, in his love, chosen, them to be his people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>); their <span class="cmt_word">Purchaser</span>, who had acquired possession of them by delivering them out of Egypt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a>); their Maker, who had constituted them a nation; and their <span class="cmt_word">Establisher</span>, by whom they had been conducted through the wilderness and settled in Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">Days of old</span>; the times of Israel's deliverance from bondage, and the times during which successive generations had lived and experienced the goodness of the Lord. The form of the word rendered "days" is poetical, and is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-15.htm">Psalm 90:15</a>, which is also ascribed to Moses. <span class="cmt_word">The years of many generations</span>; literally, <span class="accented">years of generation and generation</span>; "aetatum singularum annos" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:3-6 He is a Rock. This is the first time God is called so in Scripture. The expression denotes that the Divine power, faithfulness, and love, as revealed in Christ and the gospel, form a foundation which cannot be changed or moved, on which we may build our hopes of happiness. And under his protection we may find refuge from all our enemies, and in all our troubles; as the rocks in those countries sheltered from the burning rays of the sun, and from tempests, or were fortresses from the enemy. His work is perfect: that of redemption and salvation, in which there is a display of all the Divine perfection, complete in all its parts. All God's dealings with his creatures are regulated by wisdom which cannot err, and perfect justice. He is indeed just and right; he takes care that none shall lose by him. A high charge is exhibited against Israel. Even God's children have their spots, while in this imperfect state; for if we say we have no sin, no spot, we deceive ourselves. But the sin of Israel was not habitual, notorious, unrepented sin; which is a certain mark of the children of Satan. They were fools to forsake their mercies for lying vanities. All wilful sinners, especially sinners in Israel, are unwise and ungrateful.</body></html>
