After careful consideration of the passage with a learned Christian Hebrew,<span class= "note">[6]</span> I venture to propound this as the true translation. It is <span class= "ital">substantially </span>identical with that of the English margin. The Hebrew consists of five words only (1) "He-hath-corrupted (2) to-him (3) not (4) his-sons (5) their blemish." That the first two ought to be taken together, if the text is correct, seems certain. The same construction is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-15.htm" title="For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you shall destroy all this people.">Numbers 32:15</a>, "ye shall destroy all this people," and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-10.htm" title="Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.">1Samuel 23:10</a>, "to destroy the city." As to the third and fourth words, we have thought that their true relation is the same which we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, a "not-God," and a "not-people," and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, <span class= "ital">"</span>not-wise." In like manner Israel are in this verse called "not-sons of His." Their not-sonship, their unfilial, undutiful, ungodly behaviour to Him who is the perfection of truth and sincerity, a very Rock of fidelity to them, that is their great blemish. He has said, "Israel is my son, even my firstborn." But all Israel's behaviour gives Him the lie. The contrast between the two descriptions--the faithful God of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, and the unfaithful children of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>--is the cardinal point in the verse. In the form of the expression, <span class= "ital">lo</span>-<span class= "ital">banav </span>is strictly parallel to the <span class= "ital">Lo-ammi </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a>. The "<span class= "ital">froward </span>and <span class= "ital">crooked </span>generation" supplies two words to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm" title="With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the fraudulent you will show yourself devious.">Psalm 18:26</a>, "with the <span class= "ital">froward </span>thou wilt <span class= "ital">shew thyself froward" </span>Compare also the context of the two passages. Many other interpretations have been proposed, and some have altered the text. I believe the text to be correct, and that this is the true meaning.<p><span class= "note">[6] Mr. Bernhard Maimon, to whom I desire once for all to express my great obligations for assistance in this and many other difficulties.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:3-6 He is a Rock. This is the first time God is called so in Scripture. The expression denotes that the Divine power, faithfulness, and love, as revealed in Christ and the gospel, form a foundation which cannot be changed or moved, on which we may build our hopes of happiness. And under his protection we may find refuge from all our enemies, and in all our troubles; as the rocks in those countries sheltered from the burning rays of the sun, and from tempests, or were fortresses from the enemy. His work is perfect: that of redemption and salvation, in which there is a display of all the Divine perfection, complete in all its parts. All God's dealings with his creatures are regulated by wisdom which cannot err, and perfect justice. He is indeed just and right; he takes care that none shall lose by him. A high charge is exhibited against Israel. Even God's children have their spots, while in this imperfect state; for if we say we have no sin, no spot, we deceive ourselves. But the sin of Israel was not habitual, notorious, unrepented sin; which is a certain mark of the children of Satan. They were fools to forsake their mercies for lying vanities. All wilful sinners, especially sinners in Israel, are unwise and ungrateful.</body></html>
