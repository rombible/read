As distinguished from this is the <span class="cmt_word">milk of sheep</span>; where the word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) properly denotes fresh milk, milk in a fluid state, and with all its richness (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>, fatness) in it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fat of lambs</span>; lambs of the best, "fat" being a figurative expression for the best (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Rams of the breed of Bashan</span>; literally, <span class="accented">rams</span>, <span class="accented">sons of Bashan</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. reared in Bashan, a district famous for its cattle. <span class="cmt_word">With the fat of kidneys of wheat</span>; <span class="accented">with the kidney-fat of wheat</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the richest fat, the best and most nutritious wheat. <span class="cmt_word">And thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</span> The blood of the grape is the expressed juice of the grape, which, being red, is compared to blood.

There is no ground for the explanation "fery wine" (Keil); wine in such a state was never among the Hebrews counted a blessing. That they had and used fermented wine is certain; but what they specially esteemed as a luxury was the pure unadulterated juice of the grape freshly pressed out and drunk with the foam on it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:7-14 Moses gives particular instances of God's kindness and concern for them. The eagle's care for her young is a beautiful emblem of Christ's love, who came between Divine justice and our guilty souls, and bare our sins in his own body on the tree. And by the preached gospel, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, He stirs up and prevails upon sinners to leave Satan's bondage. In ver. 13,14, are emblems of the conquest believers have over their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, and the world, in and through Christ. Also of their safety and triumph in him; of their happy frames of soul, when they are above the world, and the things of it. This will be the blessed case of spiritual Israel in every sense in the latter day.</body></html>
