This was to be done two years; but in the third and sixth years there was a different arrangement (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-28.htm" title="At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>). In the seventh year, which was Sabbatical, there would probably be no tithe, for there was to be no harvest. The profit of the earth was for all, and every one was free to eat at pleasure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:22-29 A second portion from the produce of their land was required. The whole appointment evidently was against the covetousness, distrust, and selfishness of the human heart. It promoted friendliness, liberality, and cheerfulness, and raised a fund for the relief of the poor. They were taught that their worldly portion was most comfortably enjoyed, when shared with their brethren who were in want. If we thus serve God, and do good with what we have, it is promised that the Lord our God will bless us in all the works of our land. The blessing of God is all to our outward prosperity; and without that blessing, the work of our hands will bring nothing to pass. The blessing descends upon the working hand. Expect not that God should bless thee in thy idleness and love of ease. And it descends upon the giving hand. He who thus scatters, certainly increases; and to be free and generous in the support of religion, and any good work, is the surest and safest way of thriving.</body></html>
