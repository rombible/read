The Hebrew words are in Leviticus <span class= "ital">daah </span>and <span class= "ital">ayyah. </span>In this place they are <span class= "ital">raah, ayyah, </span>and <span class= "ital">dayyah. </span>The close resemblance between the names is noticeable. For a description of the creatures, see list in Variorum Bible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The glede</span>; <span class="accented">ra'ah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). This word occurs only here, and it is supposed by some that, by an error of the copyist, substituting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>, it has come instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-14.htm">Leviticus 11:14</a>. But it is more probable, as above suggested, that the <span class="accented">da'ah</span> of Leviticus is represented by the <span class="accented">dayyah</span> of Deuteronomy, and that consequently the reading <span class="accented">raah</span> should be re-rained. This word, derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to see, to look, would appropriately designate a bird of keen sight, one of the hawk species. The bird intended may be a buzzard, of which there are now several kinds in Palestine. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-21 Moses tells the people of Israel how God had given them three distinguishing privileges, which were their honour, and figures of those spiritual blessings in heavenly things, with which God has in Christ blessed us. Here is election; The Lord hath chosen thee. He did not choose them because they were by their own acts a peculiar people to him above other nations, but he chose them that they might be so by his grace; and thus were believers chosen, Eph 1:4. Here is adoption; Ye are the children of the Lord your God; not because God needed children, but because they were orphans, and needed a father. Every spiritual Israelite is indeed a child of God, a partaker of his nature and favour. Here is sanctification; Thou art a holy people. God's people are required to be holy, and if they are holy, they are indebted to the grace God which makes them so. Those whom God chooses to be his children, he will form to be a holy people, and zealous of good works. They must be careful to avoid every thing which might disgrace their profession, in the sight of those who watch for their halting. Our heavenly Father forbids nothing but for our welfare. Do thyself no harm; do not ruin thy health, thy reputation, thy domestic comforts, thy peace of mind. Especially do not murder thy soul. Do not be the vile slave of thy appetites and passions. Do not render all around thee miserable, and thyself wretched; but aim at that which is most excellent and useful. The laws which regarded many sorts of flesh as unclean, were to keep them from mingling with their idolatrous neighbours. It is plain in the gospel, that these laws are now done away. But let us ask our own hearts, Are we of the children of the Lord our God? Are we separate from the ungodly world, in being set apart to God's glory, the purchase of Christ's blood? Are we subjects of the work of the Holy Ghost? Lord, teach us from these precepts how pure and holy all thy people ought to live!</body></html>
