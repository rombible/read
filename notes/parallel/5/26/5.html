The translation "ready to perish" fairly represents the Hebrew; the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> means not merely to stray or wander, but also to lose one's self, to perish, to be in danger of perishing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>, etc.). Different renderings of this clause have been given. The Targum, Vulgate, Luther, etc., have, "The Aramaean (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Laban) oppressed my father;" The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> ("My father left Syria"); others, "To the Aramaean my father wandered." But these either follow another reading than that of the received text, or they are expedients to soften down the apparent ignominy of the description. The probable allusion to the wandering, nomadic life of the patriarch, however, is not to be lost sight cf. <span class="cmt_word">With a few</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in men of few</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. consisting of few men, as a small company; the father and head of the tribe is named for those belonging to him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A great nation</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7, 9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-11 When God has made good his promises to us, he expects we should own it to the honour of his faithfulness. And our creature comforts are doubly sweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. The person who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the mean origin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready to perish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation in its infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves. They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; and though become rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, or forgetful of God. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness to Israel. The comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us to be thankful for our share in public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember, and the further mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer his basket of first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing the streams to the Fountain of all consolation.</body></html>
