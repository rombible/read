It would seem that something was still to be gathered from the trees after the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus there would still be some produce untithed at that feast in any given year. But the tithe of the third year must be separated to the very last item before the Passover of the fourth.<p><span class= "bld">The third year, which is the year of tithing.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/14-28.htm" title="At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:">Deuteronomy 14:28-29</a>. In the third and sixth years, <span class= "ital">the second tithe, </span>which in other years was eaten by the owners (in kind or value) at Jerusalem, was given <span class= "ital">to the poor, </span>and was called the poor's tithe. In Talmudical language, the <span class= "ital">Ma'aser ani </span>took the place of <span class= "ital">Ma'aser sheni </span>in these years.<p>Thus the words "and hast given it unto the Levite," are applied to the <span class= "ital">first tithe, </span>which was never omitted, and which is prescribed by Numbers 18. The words that follow, "the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow," are interpreted of the <span class= "ital">poor's tithe. </span>The prescribed confession is not to be made until <span class= "ital">all the tithe </span>has been given, both <span class= "ital">first </span>and <span class= "ital">second, i.e., </span>the annual tithe to the Levites, and the second, which was in these years devoted to the poor.<p><span class= "bld">That they may eat within thy gates, and be filled.</span>--The quantity with which they were to be satisfied was duly prescribed by the Jewish scribes!<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt say before the Lord thy God, I have brought away.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I have consumed, </span>or <span class= "ital">burned out. </span>It is the same strong word used so frequently in this book for "putting away" evil, and from which the name <span class= "ital">Taberah, "</span>burning," is derived. It is taken by Jewish commentators to include everything that could possibly be required as holy under any law, whether tithe, or firstfruit of trees not yet made common, or anything that from any cause had not been brought to Jerusalem during the three previous years.<p><span class= "bld">I . . . have given . . . unto the Levite (the first tithe), and unto the stranger. . . .</span> (the poor's tithe).--Rashi.<p><span class= "bld">According to all thy commandments</span>--i.e., "giving everything in its due order" (Rashi). The following words are also taken to refer to the details of the law respecting these matters.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">I have not eaten thereof in my mourning.</span>--"When I was clean and they were unclean, or when they were clean and I was unclean" (Rashi). The tomb or presence of a dead body made both persons and things unclean (Numbers 19).<p><span class= "bld">Neither have I taken away.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">consumed any of them in uncleanness.</span><p><span class= "bld">Nor given ought thereof for </span>(or to)<span class= "bld"> the dead.</span>--Rashi explains, "to provide for him a coffin or grave-clothes." Another explanation, which is certainly possible, is, "I have not made any offering to an idol from them." "They joined themselves to <span class= "ital">Baal-peor, </span>and ate the sacrifices <span class= "ital">of the dead</span>" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm" title="They joined themselves also to Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.">Psalm 106:28</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I have hearkened . . . and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.</span>--A claim which might be truly made as to outward observances and requirements. I am therefore the more disposed to take the confession in these verses in its most literal sense, and to limit it to the particular things with which it was connected--the tithes and offerings.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven.</span>--A phrase like this occurs frequently in Solomon's prayer; but there is a difference there in the Hebrew, which is less beautiful than in this place. The exact phrase is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-27.htm" title="Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even to heaven.">2Chronicles 30:27</a>. And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-15.htm" title="And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:">2Chronicles 36:15</a>, we have "His dwelling-place" applied to Jerusalem and the Temple. This suggests that the thought here may be twofold. Look down from the dwelling-place of Thy holiness here below, and not only thence, but from thine own dwelling-place in heaven.<p><span class= "bld">And bless thy people Israel, and the land </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">the ground</span>)<span class= "ital"><span class= "bld"> </span>which thou hast given us.<span class= "ital"></span></span>--"We have done what Thou hast decreed for us. Do Thou that which it rests with Thee to do" (Rashi).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - On the occasion of presenting the tithes, a special service was also to be made. The tithe here referred to is the vegetable or predial tithe, which, at the end of each third year, as here prescribed, was to be converted into a gift to the poor and needy. This, properly the second tithe (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), but usually called the third tithe (Tobit 1:7, 8; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 22), is quite distinct from the Levitical tithe prescribed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-32</a>; and it is a mistake to suppose that the law here was designed to contravene or supersede that in the earlier books (see Kitto, 'Bibl. Cycl.,' 3:1010). As this tithe completed the triennial series of tithes which the Israelites had to offer, it was fitting that in presenting it a solemn declaration should be made by the offerer to the effect that he had honorably and conscientiously discharged all the obligations in this respect which the Law laid upon him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The third year, which is the year of tithing</span>. As each week ended with a Sabbath, so a sabbatical year ended each cycle or week of years; and as on it no tithes were levied, "the year of tithing" here specified would be the third and the sixth years in each septennial period. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:12-15 How should the earth yield its increase, or, if it does, what comfort can we take in it, unless therewith our God gives us his blessing? All this represented the covenant relation between a reconciled God and every true believer, and the privileges and duties belonging to it. We must be watchful, and show that according to the covenant of grace in Christ Jesus, the Lord is our God, and we are his people, waiting in his appointed way for the performance of his gracious promises.</body></html>
