Rashi says, "Every day these commandments shall be new before thine eyes, as though on that very day thou hadst received them."<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt therefore keep and do them.</span>--It is a beautiful thought that the form of this command (as of many others) makes it prophetic of its own fulfilment. "It is the voice from heaven blessing thee," says Rashi. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-8.htm" title="And you shall return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command you this day.">Deuteronomy 30:8</a>.)<p>(17, 18) <span class= "bld">Thou hast avouched . . . and the Lord hath avouched.</span>--The Hebrew word is simply the ordinary word for "to say." "Thou hast said," and "He hath said." There is no distinctive word for "to promise" in Hebrew. "To say" is sufficient. "Hath He said, and shall He not do it?" "Let your yea <span class= "ital">be yea, </span>and your nay nay," like His. But Rashi says there is no exact parallel to this use of the verb in the Old Testament, except, perhaps, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm" title="How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?">Psalm 94:4</a>, where it means, "they boast themselves." Let Israel boast in God, and God will boast Himself of them, as His peculiar people.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">And to make thee high.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">most high; </span>Heb., <span class= "ital">'Elyon, </span>a well-known name of God. Here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command you this day, that the LORD your God will set you on high above all nations of the earth:">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>, it is (prophetically and in the Divine purpose) applied to Israel. "Thou shalt put <span class= "ital">my Name </span>upon the children of Israel" was the law of blessing for the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-27.htm" title="And they shall put my name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them.">Numbers 6:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In praise, and in name, and in honour.</span>--Perhaps, rather, <span class= "ital">to be a praise, and to be a name, and to be an honour, and to become a people of holiness to Jehovah. </span>There is an allusion to this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-9.htm" title="And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it.">Jeremiah 33:9</a>, "And it shall be to me <span class= "ital">a name </span>of joy, a <span class= "ital">praise, </span>and an <span class= "ital">honour </span>before all the nations of the earth;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/62-6.htm" title="I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: you that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,">Isaiah 62:6-7</a>, "Ye that make mention of the name of the Lord, keep not silence, and give Him no rest, till He establish, and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth."<p>But if, as some would have us believe, the Book of Deuteronomy draws these things from the prophets, rather than the prophets from Moses, how is it that there is not the faintest allusion in Deuteronomy to Jerusalem, which in the days of the prophets had become the centre of all these hopes?<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This day</span>. This refers generally to the time when this discourse was delivered. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:16-19 Moses here enforces the precepts. They are God's laws, therefore thou shalt do them, to that end were they given thee; do them, and dispute them not; do them, and draw not back; do them, not carelessly and hypocritically, but with thy heart and soul, thy whole heart and thy whole soul. We forswear ourselves, and break the most sacred engagement, if, when we have taken the Lord to be our God, we do not make conscience of obeying his commands. We are elected to obedience, 1Pe 1:2; chosen that we should be holy, Eph 1:4; purified a peculiar people, that we might not only do good works, but be zealous in them, Tit 2:14. Holiness is true honour, and the only way to everlasting honour.</body></html>
