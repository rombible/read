As to the harvest, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-22.htm" title="And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not make clean riddance of the corners of your field when you reap, neither shall you gather any gleaning of your harvest: you shall leave them to the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 23:22</a>. It is noticeable that this law is connected with the Feast of Pentecost in that place. Never was such care for the widow and the poor manifested as after the day of Pentecost in the New Testament. When "great grace was upon them all," it is written that "neither was there any among them that lacked."<p>In a very special way and for some special reason, all through the Old Testament, "the Lord careth for the stranger." What the reason is, if we had the Old Testament only, we might find it hard to discover. But when we open the New Testament, we may see that this is one aspect of the love of God the Father to His Son Jesus Christ, who was one day to come among us as "a stranger," when there was "no room for Him in the inn." His coming hither as a stranger could not be unnoticed. And, therefore, the name and mention of the stranger all through the Old Testament is like a path strewn with flowers, in expectation of the coming of one that is greatly beloved. We see angels walking upon the earth, entertained as strangers. The wealthy patriarch, a "prince of God" among the Canaanites, confesses himself a "stranger and pilgrim on the earth." Those that inherit the land are put in the same category, "Ye are strangers and sojourners with Me." The stranger sits beside the Levite at Israel's table. The second great commandment is rehearsed again for his especial benefit. "He shall be unto you as one born among you, and <span class= "ital">thou shalt love him as thyself." </span>There is only one key to all this combination of tenderness. "<span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">was a stranger</span>, and ye took me in."<p>(18,22) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt.</span>--An exhortation thoroughly in place here, in the writings of Moses. In this form it occurs repeatedly in the Pentateuch, but not elsewhere. It is not the language which would naturally suggest itself to the prophets of later times.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - The law against perverting the right of strangers, widows, and orphans is here repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a>, with the addition that the raiment of the widow was not to be taken in pledge. To enforce this, the people are reminded that they themselves as a nation had been in the condition of strangers and bondmen in Egypt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33, 34</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:14-22 It is not hard to prove that purity, piety, justice, mercy, fair conduct, kindness to the poor and destitute, consideration for them, and generosity of spirit, are pleasing to God, and becoming in his redeemed people.
