(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-26.htm" title="If you at all take your neighbor's raiment to pledge, you shall deliver it to him by that the sun goes down:">Exodus 22:26-27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">It shall be righteousness.</span>--LXX., <span class= "ital">it shall be alms, or mercy. </span>In other words, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-13.</span> - If one had to <span class="accented">take</span> a pledge from another, he was not to go into the house of the latter and take what he thought fit; he must stand without, and allow the debtor to bring to him what he saw meet to offer. He might stand outside and summon the debtor to produce his pledge, but he was not insolently to enter the house and lay hands on any part of the owner's property. To stand outside and call is still a common mode of seeking access to a person in his own house or apartment among the Arabs, and is regarded as the only respectful mode. There would be thus a mitigation of the severity of the exaction, the tendency of which would be to preserve good feeling between the parties. If the debtor was needy, and being such could give in pledge only some necessary article, such as his upper garment in which he slept at night, the pledge was to be returned ere nightfall, that the man might sleep in his own raiment, and have a grateful feeling towards his creditor. In many parts of the East, with the Arabs notably, it is customary for the poor to sleep in their outer garment. "During the day the poor while at work can and do dispense with this outside raiment, but at night it is greatly needed, even in summer. This furnishes a good reason why this sort of pledge should be restored before night" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:192, 500). The earlier legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25, 26</a>) is evidently assumed here as well known by the people. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be righteousness unto thee</span> (see on Deuteronomy 6:25). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:5-13 It is of great consequence that love be kept up between husband and wife; that they carefully avoid every thing which might make them strange one to another. Man-stealing was a capital crime, which could not be settled, as other thefts, by restitution. The laws concerning leprosy must be carefully observed. Thus all who feel their consciences under guilt and wrath, must not cover it, or endeavour to shake off their convictions; but by repentance, and prayer, and humble confession, take the way to peace and pardon. Some orders are given about pledges for money lent. This teaches us to consult the comfort and subsistence of others, as much as our own advantage. Let the poor debtor sleep in his own raiment, and praise God for thy kindness to him. Poor debtors ought to feel more than commonly they do, the goodness of creditors who do not take all the advantage of the law against them, nor should this ever be looked upon as weakness.</body></html>
