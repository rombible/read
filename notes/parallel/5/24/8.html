By this law the priests are directed how to proceed with those afflicted with leprosy; and here the people are counseled by Moses to follow the directions of the priests in this case, however painful it might be for them to submit to the restrictions that would be thereby imposed upon them, remembering what the Lord did to Miriam the sister of Moses, how even she was separated from the camp by the express command of God until she was healed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>). Michaelis, Keil, and others, following the Vulgate ("Observa diligenter ne incurras plagam leprae sed facies quaecunque docuerint to sacerdotes"), understand this passage as inculcating obedience to the priests, lest leprosy should be incurred as a punishment for disobedience. But it is improbable that a general counsel to submit to the priests should be introduced among the special counsels here given; and besides, the formula <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> means, "Take heed to yourself in respect of" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>), rather than "Beware of," or "Be on your guard against." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:5-13 It is of great consequence that love be kept up between husband and wife; that they carefully avoid every thing which might make them strange one to another. Man-stealing was a capital crime, which could not be settled, as other thefts, by restitution. The laws concerning leprosy must be carefully observed. Thus all who feel their consciences under guilt and wrath, must not cover it, or endeavour to shake off their convictions; but by repentance, and prayer, and humble confession, take the way to peace and pardon. Some orders are given about pledges for money lent. This teaches us to consult the comfort and subsistence of others, as much as our own advantage. Let the poor debtor sleep in his own raiment, and praise God for thy kindness to him. Poor debtors ought to feel more than commonly they do, the goodness of creditors who do not take all the advantage of the law against them, nor should this ever be looked upon as weakness.</body></html>
