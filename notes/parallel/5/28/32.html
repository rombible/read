Many of the nations bordering on Israel were accustomed when they made inroads to take away, not only the cattle, but the children for slaves. Another equally pathetic passage in Jeremiah touches on the very same thing. "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children, refused to be comforted for her children, <span class= "ital">because they were not." </span>And it would not always be said, as it was then, "they shall come again from the land of the enemy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Thine eyes shall . . . fail</span>--i.e., shall consume. "All longing after that which comes not is called consumption of the eyes" (Rashi).<p><span class= "bld">And there shall be no might in thine hand.</span>--The Hebrew phrase here is very remarkable. It occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm" title="It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take you heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.">Genesis 31:29</a>. "It is <span class= "ital">in the power of mine hand </span>to <span class= "ital">do </span>you hurt." But it means, literally, <span class= "ital">thou shalt have no hand toward God, i.e., </span>"thou shalt not be able to lift a hand to Him." We may compare Jacob wrestling with the angel, and Moses in the fight with Amalek: "When he held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed." Some would perhaps explain the phrase in another way; but this explanation is thoroughly in accordance with the genius of the Hebrew language, and I have good authority for it. Hezekiah said, "Mine eyes fail with looking upward." Here the eyes fail with looking, but cannot look up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there shall be no might in thine hand</span>. Keil proposes to render here, "Thy hand shall not be to thee towards God;" and others, "Thy hand shall not be to thee for God," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. instead of God. But <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> here is not "the Mighty One, God; but simply" might, strength, power," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>. Literally rendered, the words are, <span class="accented">And not for might is thy hand</span>, the meaning of which is well expressed in the Authorized Version. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:15-44 If we do not keep God's commandments, we not only come short of the blessing promised, but we lay ourselves under the curse, which includes all misery, as the blessing all happiness. Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.</body></html>
