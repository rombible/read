There are two views of the derivation of the first of the three words employed. Probably the Authorised Version is right. The three words have each of them the definite article in the original, just as if they were so many diseases. "<span class= "ital">The </span>curse, and <span class= "ital">the </span>terror, and <span class= "ital">the </span>rebuke" of the Almighty are terrible obstacles to any human undertaking.<p><span class= "bld">In all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in every putting forth of thine hand which thou makest, i.e., </span>in every undertaking.

This is characteristic. The prophets say, "Thus saith the Lord." Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, sometimes exhorts Israel in His name without any such introduction. (Comp. the phrase "to forsake Moses" (literally, <span class= "ital">apostasy from Moses</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-26.</span> <span class="accented">- First group</span>.

Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.</body></html>
