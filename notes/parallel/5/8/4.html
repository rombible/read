We cannot say that anything miraculous is certainly intended, though it is not impossible. It may mean that God in His providence directed them to clothe themselves in a manner suitable to their journey and their mode of life, just as He taught them how to make and clothe His own tabernacle with various fabrics and coverings of skin. This tabernacle, which was God's dwelling, was (like the Temple) a figure of man. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm" title="I clothed you also with broidered work, and shod you with badgers' skin, and I girded you about with fine linen, and I covered you with silk.">Ezekiel 16:10</a> : "I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin.")<p><span class= "bld">Neither did thy foot swell.</span>--Just as those who were to die in the wilderness could not live, so those who were to enter Canaan were preserved in health through the journey thither. It seems allowable to point out the spiritual interpretation of the passage also. If "the way" that God leads any of His children through this present evil world should seem long, and should entail constant need of renewal and cleansing in His sight, He provides us with "raiment that waxes not old," in the everlasting righteousness of His Son, and also in the good works which He prepares for us to walk in--that "fine linen which is the righteousness of saints." He also says of those that wait on the Lord that they shall "walk, and not faint" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm" title="But they that wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - As the manna furnished by God's creative power saved them from hunger, so by God's providence and care their raiment was marvelously kept from decay, and they had not to go barefoot from their sandals being worn out. Waxed not old upon thee; literally, <span class="accented">d</span>i<span class="accented">d not fall away</span>, <span class="accented">waste away from upon thee</span>. This cannot mean that such was the abundant supply of raiment to the Israelites in the Arabian desert, that there was no need for them to wear garments rent and tattered from long use, as they had large flocks and herds whence a sufficient supply of wool and leather could be obtained, and there were among them skilled artificers, by whom these could be made into articles of clothing (Rosenm&uuml;ller, J. D. Michaelis, etc.). For, as Knobel observes, "This were something too insignificant beside the miraculous manna; and besides, this does not lie in the expression, which rather intimates that the clothes upon them were not worn out nor fell from them in rags, because God gave them a marvelous durability." At the same time, there is no reason to suppose that the Israelites did not make use of such supplies as were within their reach for purposes of clothing, any more than that they lived only on manna during the forty years of their wandering. Still less need we resort to such fanciful suppositions as that the garments of the Israelitish children expanded as they grew up, like the shells of snails - which is the notion of some of the Jewish rabbins, and adopted by some of the Christian Fathers (see Deyling, 'Obss. Sacc.,' II. 17. p. 247). <span class="cmt_word">Neither did thy foot swell.</span> The verb here is found in only one other passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a>), where this passage is repeated; and the meaning is doubtful. The LXX. render here by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">became callous</span>; but in Nehemiah the rendering they give is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">were torn</span>, the object torn being, according to the Cod. Vat., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">abbey</span>, <span class="accented">their feet</span>, according to the Cod. Alex., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>, <span class="accented">their sandals</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>, the shoe or sandal is specially mentioned in the same connection as here. The verb, however, cannot mean tear or torn, neither does it mean swell; the idea involved is rather that of softening, or , melting or flowing; and the meaning here seems to be, "Thy foot did not get into a bruised and wounded state" - which would have been the case had their sandals not been preserved from breaking or being worn out. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-9 Obedience must be, 1. Careful, observe to do; 2. Universal, to do all the commandments; and 3. From a good principle, with a regard to God as the Lord, and their God, and with a holy fear of him. To engage them to this obedience. Moses directs them to look back. It is good to remember all the ways, both of God's providence and grace, by which he has led us through this wilderness, that we may cheerfully serve him and trust in him. They must remember the straits they were sometimes brought into, for mortifying their pride, and manifesting their perverseness; to prove them, that they and others might know all that was in their heart, and that all might see that God chose them, not for any thing in them which might recommend them to his favour. They must remember the miraculous supplies of food and raiment granted them. Let none of God's children distrust their Father, nor take any sinful course for the supply of their necessities. Some way or other, God will provide for them in the way of duty and honest diligence, and verily they shall be fed. It may be applied spiritually; the word of God is the food of the soul. Christ is the word of God; by him we live. They must also remember the rebukes they had been under, and not without need. This use we should make of all our afflictions; by them let us be quickened to our duty. Moses also directs them to look forward to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward, to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward will furnish us with arguments for obedience. Moses saw in that land a type of the better country. The gospel church is the New Testament Canaan, watered with the Spirit in his gifts and graces, planted with trees of righteousness, bearing fruits of righteousness. Heaven is the good land, in which nothing is wanting, and where is fulness of joy.</body></html>
