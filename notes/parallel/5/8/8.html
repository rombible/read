The principal corn crops were wheat and barley. The vine was largely and carefully cultivated; the olive required little cultivation, being almost a spontaneous growth, and forming one of the most valuable productions of the country; the fig was also indigenous in Palestine, and still grows there, both wild and cultivated, in abundance; that the pomegranate (<span class="accented">firemen</span>) also was very abundant may be inferred from the number of places named from this (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45, 47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-13.htm">Judges 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Honey</span>. The word so rendered (<span class="accented">d'bash</span>) is used both of the honey of bees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-26.htm">1 Samuel 14:26</a>, etc.; Psalm 81:17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>, etc.), and of the honey of grapes, a syrup obtained by boiling down the newly expressed juice of the grape to a half or third part of its bulk, and still known among the Arabs by the name of <span class="accented">dibs</span> (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' it. p. 442; Smith, Bib. Dict.,' s.v. 'Honey'). In the wilderness, the people had murmured that they had been brought into an evil place, no place of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; and where there was no water to drink (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-5.htm">Numbers 20:5</a>). Moses here tells them that the land they were about to occupy was not such a place, but one abounding in all those things of which they had found the wilderness so destitute. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-9 Obedience must be, 1. Careful, observe to do; 2. Universal, to do all the commandments; and 3. From a good principle, with a regard to God as the Lord, and their God, and with a holy fear of him. To engage them to this obedience. Moses directs them to look back. It is good to remember all the ways, both of God's providence and grace, by which he has led us through this wilderness, that we may cheerfully serve him and trust in him. They must remember the straits they were sometimes brought into, for mortifying their pride, and manifesting their perverseness; to prove them, that they and others might know all that was in their heart, and that all might see that God chose them, not for any thing in them which might recommend them to his favour. They must remember the miraculous supplies of food and raiment granted them. Let none of God's children distrust their Father, nor take any sinful course for the supply of their necessities. Some way or other, God will provide for them in the way of duty and honest diligence, and verily they shall be fed. It may be applied spiritually; the word of God is the food of the soul. Christ is the word of God; by him we live. They must also remember the rebukes they had been under, and not without need. This use we should make of all our afflictions; by them let us be quickened to our duty. Moses also directs them to look forward to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward, to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward will furnish us with arguments for obedience. Moses saw in that land a type of the better country. The gospel church is the New Testament Canaan, watered with the Spirit in his gifts and graces, planted with trees of righteousness, bearing fruits of righteousness. Heaven is the good land, in which nothing is wanting, and where is fulness of joy.</body></html>
