Israel must remember (1) the leading of Jehovah, and (2) their own rebellious perversity in the journey through the wilderness. The same recollection is made the occasion for a separate note of praise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-16.htm" title="To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 136:16</a> : "To him which <span class= "ital">led his people through the wilderness; </span>for his mercy endureth for ever."<p><span class= "bld">The way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years.</span>--Not so much the literal journey, but "the way:" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the manner. The details of the actual journey are of course included, but only as incidents of "the way." In the Acts of the Apostles the Christian life is in several passages called "the way." In all these things the Israelites were types of us.<p><span class= "bld">To humble thee, and to prove thee.</span>--The way in itself is described as "three days' journey into the wilderness," so far as the leading to Sinai is concerned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm" title="And they shall listen to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us: and now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.">Exodus 3:18</a>), and "eleven days' journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-2.htm" title="(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadeshbarnea.)">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>). It was in the power of Jehovah to bring Israel from Egypt to Canaan, had He so willed it, without delay, in a very little time. And just so with "the way" of salvation. There is no intrinsic or necessary impossibility in the <span class= "ital">immediate </span>turning of mankind, or of any individual, from darkness to light. And this change might be followed by immediate removal from "this present evil world" into the place which Christ has gone before to prepare for us. But manifestly the formation of human character by probation and training would vanish in such a process as this. There could be no well-tried and deliberate purpose to serve our Creator and Redeemer in any of us--or, at least, <span class= "ital">no proof </span>of our deliberate preference for His service--under such circumstances. Nor, again, could there be that <span class= "ital">humility </span>which arises only out of self-knowledge. The transitory nature of all mere human resolutions and impressions for good demonstrates to the man who knows himself, better than anything else could do, the power and patience of his Redeemer, and the moral cost of his redemption. This human <span class= "ital">transitoriness </span>and feebleness is strikingly illustrated by the story of the Exodus.<p><span class= "bld">To know what was in thine heart.</span>--"To know" is not simply that <span class= "ital">He </span>might know ("Hell and destruction are before the Lord; how much more then the hearts of the children of men! "), but <span class= "ital">that the knowledge may arise</span>--to <span class= "ital">determine, </span>disclose, discover. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-31.htm" title="However, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.">2Chronicles 32:31</a> : "God left him (Hezekiah) to try him, <span class= "ital">to know </span>all that was in his heart." What God Himself knows by omniscience He sometimes brings to light by evidence for the sake of His creatures. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a> : "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places <span class= "ital">might be known </span>by (by means of) the church the manifold wisdom of God.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-9 Obedience must be, 1. Careful, observe to do; 2. Universal, to do all the commandments; and 3. From a good principle, with a regard to God as the Lord, and their God, and with a holy fear of him. To engage them to this obedience. Moses directs them to look back. It is good to remember all the ways, both of God's providence and grace, by which he has led us through this wilderness, that we may cheerfully serve him and trust in him. They must remember the straits they were sometimes brought into, for mortifying their pride, and manifesting their perverseness; to prove them, that they and others might know all that was in their heart, and that all might see that God chose them, not for any thing in them which might recommend them to his favour. They must remember the miraculous supplies of food and raiment granted them. Let none of God's children distrust their Father, nor take any sinful course for the supply of their necessities. Some way or other, God will provide for them in the way of duty and honest diligence, and verily they shall be fed. It may be applied spiritually; the word of God is the food of the soul. Christ is the word of God; by him we live. They must also remember the rebukes they had been under, and not without need. This use we should make of all our afflictions; by them let us be quickened to our duty. Moses also directs them to look forward to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward, to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward will furnish us with arguments for obedience. Moses saw in that land a type of the better country. The gospel church is the New Testament Canaan, watered with the Spirit in his gifts and graces, planted with trees of righteousness, bearing fruits of righteousness. Heaven is the good land, in which nothing is wanting, and where is fulness of joy.</body></html>
