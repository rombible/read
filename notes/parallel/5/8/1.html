He humbled them that he might test the state of their heart and affections towards him, using the distress and privations to which they were subjected as means of bringing out what was in them, and of leading them to feel their entire dependence on him for help, sustenance, and guidance. Not only by commands difficult to be obeyed laid on men, and by mighty works done in their view, does God prove men (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>); but also by afflictions and calamities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-22.htm">Judges 2:22</a>; 3:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-7.htm">Psalm 81:7</a>, etc.), as well as by benefits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). Humbled so as to see his own weakness, chastised out of all self-conceit by affliction, man is brought to submit to God, to hear and obey him; and along with this the experience of God's goodness tends to draw men, in grateful acknowledgment of his mercy and bounty, to yield themselves to him and sincerely and lovingly to serve him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - God's dealings with the Israelites were disciplinary. Both by the afflictions and privations to which they were subjected, and by the provision they received and the protection afforded to them, God sought to bring them into and keep them in a right state of mind towards him - a state of humble dependence, submissive obedience, and hopeful trust. But that this effect should be produced, it was needful that they should mark and remember all his ways towards them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-9 Obedience must be, 1. Careful, observe to do; 2. Universal, to do all the commandments; and 3. From a good principle, with a regard to God as the Lord, and their God, and with a holy fear of him. To engage them to this obedience. Moses directs them to look back. It is good to remember all the ways, both of God's providence and grace, by which he has led us through this wilderness, that we may cheerfully serve him and trust in him. They must remember the straits they were sometimes brought into, for mortifying their pride, and manifesting their perverseness; to prove them, that they and others might know all that was in their heart, and that all might see that God chose them, not for any thing in them which might recommend them to his favour. They must remember the miraculous supplies of food and raiment granted them. Let none of God's children distrust their Father, nor take any sinful course for the supply of their necessities. Some way or other, God will provide for them in the way of duty and honest diligence, and verily they shall be fed. It may be applied spiritually; the word of God is the food of the soul. Christ is the word of God; by him we live. They must also remember the rebukes they had been under, and not without need. This use we should make of all our afflictions; by them let us be quickened to our duty. Moses also directs them to look forward to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward, to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward will furnish us with arguments for obedience. Moses saw in that land a type of the better country. The gospel church is the New Testament Canaan, watered with the Spirit in his gifts and graces, planted with trees of righteousness, bearing fruits of righteousness. Heaven is the good land, in which nothing is wanting, and where is fulness of joy.</body></html>
