and this continues to be the case in Palestine and many other parts of the East even at the present day. That roads, however, properly so called, were not unknown to the Hebrews, even in early times, is evident, not only from this passage, but also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-17.htm">Numbers 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-22.htm">Numbers 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-27.htm">Deuteronomy 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>. The design of the injunction here was that every facility should be afforded to the fugitive to escape to the place of refuge. In later times, it was enacted that the roads leading to these cities should be repaired every year in the month Adar, and every obstruction removed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-13 Here is the law settled between the blood of the murdered, and the blood of the murderer; provision is made, that the cities of refuge should be a protection, so that a man should not die for that as a crime, which was not his willing act. In Christ, the Lord our Righteousness, refuge is provided for those who by faith flee unto him. But there is no refuge in Jesus Christ for presumptuous sinners, who go on still in their trespasses. Those who flee to Christ from their sins, shall be safe in him, but not those who expect to be sheltered by him in their sins.</body></html>
