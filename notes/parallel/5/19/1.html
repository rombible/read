Joshua 20)<p>(1) <span class= "bld">When the Lord thy God hath cut off the nations.</span>--We find that the three cities of refuge on the west of Jordan were appointed by Joshua after the conquest (Joshua 20). The first three on the east of Jordan, namely, Bezer, Ramoth-Gilead, and Golan, had already been selected by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-41.htm" title="Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;">Deuteronomy 4:41</a>, &c), but Joshua assigned them to their Levitical possessors.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt prepare thee a way.</span>--Upon this phrase Rashi remarks (from the Talmud) that <span class= "ital">"Miklot! Miklot </span>('Refuge! Refuge!') was written up at the parting of the ways."<p><span class= "bld">Divide the coasts of thy land . . . into three parts.</span>--So that no part of the country might be too far from any of the cities of refuge.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">As when a man goeth into the wood.</span>--An obvious instance.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">The avenger of the blood.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the redeemer of the blood. </span>The Hebrew, <span class= "ital">gooel </span>stands for all the three words, "redeemer," "avenger," "kinsman."<p>(8, 9) <span class= "bld">if the Lord thy God enlarge thy coast . . . thou shalt add three cities</span>--i.e., thou shalt add three to the six, making <span class= "ital">nine </span>in all. There is no trace of this ever having been done in the history of Israel. The comments of Jewish writers show that nothing <span class= "ital">is </span>known of the fact in their literature. Some of them point out that only seven nations were assigned to thehost of Joshua, and that the land occupied by these seven could not have needed more than the six cities. They lay stress upon the words "If He give thee <span class= "ital">all the land which He promised to give thy fathers</span>" (not merely the seven nations promised to thee). They refer to the Kenites and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites in particular, as three nations promised to Abraham. It would have been more to the purpose if they had referred to the Hittites. The cities of this people, as recently discovered, from Kedesh on the Orontes to Carchemish, lie to the north of the known territory of Israel. If "all the laud of the Hittites" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm" title="From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.">Joshua 1:4</a>) had been conquered, the three additional cities might have been required. But though this land seems to have been tributary to Solomon, it was not so occupied by Israel as to necessitate the appointment of three additional cities of refuge. And Solomon's empire lasted only for his own reign. But without going back to these details, they also take the promise as prophetical; holding that when the Lord has "circumcised their heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>), "to love the Lord," and given them "one heart and one way to fear Him for ever, and shall make an everlasting covenant with them, and put His fear in their hearts ( <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/32-39.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:">Jeremiah 32:39-40</a>) that they shall not depart from Him," then the promises will be fulfilled. All the land will be given to them, and they will need these other cities. One writer adds, "Blessed is he that waiteth, and shall attain to it," from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-12.htm" title="Blessed is he that waits, and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.">Daniel 12:12</a>. Thus the Jews take the passage as prophetic of their ultimate restoration. Evidently it is no addition of later times, but the genuine language of Moses. What later writer would have thought of adding it?<p>(10) <span class= "bld">That innocent blood be not shed</span>--i.e., the blood of the manslayer who can find no refuge, and yet is no murderer.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him.</span>--Rashi's comment upon this is in the spirit of St. John: "By way of hatred he comes to lying in wait: and hence it has been said, when a man has transgressed a light commandment, that he will end by transgressing a greater. Therefore when he has broken the commandment, Thou shalt not hate, he will end by coming to bloodshed." What is this but "He that hateth his brother is a murderer"?<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood.</span>--There is as yet no idea of a public trial and execution, which belongs to a more advanced stage of civilisation than this.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Shalt put away.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">consume, </span>or, as it were, <span class= "ital">burn out.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - Moses had before this enunciated the law concerning cities of refuge for manslayers, and had already pointed out the cities on the east of the Jordan that were to be set apart for this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-41.htm">Deuteronomy 4:41</a>, etc.), he here repeats the law with special reference to the appointment of such cities "in the midst of the land," on the west of the Jordan, in Canaan itself; and he supplements the instructions formerly given with directions as to the maintenance of roads to the cities of refuge, and as to the division of the land, so that there should be a city of refuge in every third of the land. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-13 Here is the law settled between the blood of the murdered, and the blood of the murderer; provision is made, that the cities of refuge should be a protection, so that a man should not die for that as a crime, which was not his willing act. In Christ, the Lord our Righteousness, refuge is provided for those who by faith flee unto him. But there is no refuge in Jesus Christ for presumptuous sinners, who go on still in their trespasses. Those who flee to Christ from their sins, shall be safe in him, but not those who expect to be sheltered by him in their sins.</body></html>
