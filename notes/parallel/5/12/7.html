There it seems as if the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the flesh was to be given to the priest. "And the flesh of them shall be thine [the priest's], as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine." This may be taken to mean that just as the wave breast and the right shoulder are the perquisites of the priests in the case of other offerings, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the peace offering, so in the case of the firstling offering the whole flesh shall be the priest's; and thus taken, the passage presents an unquestionable discrepancy to that in Deuteronomy. But probably the passage is not to be so taken. The particle translated "as" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>.) not infrequently occurs in the sense of "according to, after the manner of," implying conformity to some rule or model (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-2.htm">Genesis 44:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-4.htm">Numbers 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-3.htm">Numbers 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-18.htm">Numbers 29:18</a>; Psalm 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; Zechariah 2:10 [Zechariah 2:6], etc.). The passage, therefore, may be rendered thus: <span class="accented">And the flesh of them shalt thou take after the manner</span> (<span class="accented">or according to the rule</span>), of the wave breast, etc., <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the whole of it, but only these parts. So the LXX. seem to have taken the passage: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Of some of the offerings the whole was received by the priest, as in the case of the sin offering and trespass offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, etc.; Leviticus 7:1, etc.); while of others only certain portions, viz. the wave breast and the heave shoulder, were given to him, as in the case of the peace offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-28.htm">Leviticus 7:28</a>, etc.). The purport of the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-18.htm">Numbers 18:18</a> is that, in respect of the firstling offering, the allotment to the priest shall be after the same manner as in the peace offering. There is thus no discrepancy between the two passages. The animal belonged originally to the offerer; when he brought it before the Lord part of it was consumed on the altar, part of it was assigned to the priest, and the rest, as a matter of course, remained with himself. The law in Numbers, addressed to the priest, intimates what he might claim as his portion; the law in Deuteronomy, where the people are addressed, directs them how to use the portion that remained with them. It may be added that, even supposing that all the flesh was given to the priest, yet, as it had to be consumed on the day in which the sacrifice was offered, and as every clean person in the house might partake of it, it is almost certain that the offerer would, as a matter of course, share in the meal, as was usual in the case of sacrificial meals. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto</span>; enjoy whatever your hand may gain, whatever you may earn, all the good which the Lord may give you (cf. ver. 18; 15:10; 23. 20; 28:8, 20). The phrase is peculiar to Deuteronomy; but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:5-32 The command to bring ALL the sacrifices to the door of the tabernacle, was now explained with reference to the promised land. As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.</body></html>
