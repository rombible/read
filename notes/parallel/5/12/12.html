and of this the Levite who might happen at the time to be resident among them was to partake. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice before the Lord.</span> This phrase occurs frequently in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-26.htm">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-11.htm">Deuteronomy 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>); elsewhere it appears only once - <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>, where it is used with reference to the Feast of Tabernacles, Moses now enjoins this festivity to be observed in connection with all the sacrificial meals. <span class="cmt_word">The Levite that is within your gates.</span> The Levites had no share in the land as the property of their tribe; but they had towns allotted to them among the different tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>.), so that in this way they were dispersed through the nation. Hence, perhaps, they are described as "within the gates" of the rest of the people. Or, as the Levites seem to have itinerated in the discharge of various offices among the people, the phrase may designate them as on this account occasionally resident among others in their community; just as "the stranger that is within thy gates" means the person of some other nation who for the time being was resident in any of the towns of Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:5-32 The command to bring ALL the sacrifices to the door of the tabernacle, was now explained with reference to the promised land. As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.</body></html>
