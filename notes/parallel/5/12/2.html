In the land of Jehovah there must be no trace of any other god but Him. The non-fulfilment of this command in the early history of Israel has led some to suppose that the command itself belongs to later times. But it must be observed that the destruction of these things is inextricably connected with the conquest of the country <span class= "ital">in detail. </span>It was part of the work assigned to the several tribes of Israel when the land had been divided by Joshua. His work was to conquer the Canaanitish armies, and give Israel possession of their chief cities. He then assigned the land to the several tribes, to make it their own throughout. Obviously, if every tribe had insisted upon destroying all monuments of idolatry in its own territory, one of two results must have followed: either the remnant of the Canaanitish nations must have been excited to fresh acts of rebellion and hostility, resulting in their extermination, or else they must have yielded themselves entirely to the worship of Jehovah. But Israel disobeyed the order. They did not themselves yield to idolatry in Joshua's time. The disturbance made respecting the altar Ed (see Joshua 22) is quite sufficient of itself to prove the strictness of the law against strange altars. But the Canaanites being left undisturbed after they ceased to resist openly, and their objects of worship being left unmolested, there were constant temptations to idolatry, to which Israel yielded. And thus it was not until the times of Heze-kiah and Josiah that these laws were carried out. But this does not prove the law to have come into existence then, any more than the present condition of the human race proves that man was not made in God's image in Paradise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - In order to this, Israel was, as soon as the land was possessed, to destroy all the objects and means of idolatrous worship in the land. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-7.htm">Isaiah 57:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-4.htm">2 Kings 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>). The heathen had their places of worship on lofty elevations, probably because they imagined they were thus nearer to the object of their worship; and they sought also the shade of woods or thick-foliaged trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>), under which to perform their rites, as tending to inspire awe, and as in keeping with the mysterious character of their rites.

The Israelites are charged not to bring the rites and usages of idolaters into the worship of God; not under colour of making it better. We cannot serve God and mammon; nor worship the true God and idols; nor depend upon Christ Jesus and upon superstitious or self-righteous confidences.</body></html>
