The denunciation of the Assyrian here passes from the third to the second person. Sennacherib is told that the royal line of Nineveh is to be suddenly exterminated--a prediction accomplished when his great-grandson Saracus, the last king of Nineveh, destroyed himself in despair. He is also told that the Assyrian idols are destined to destruction, and that their very temple is to witness his own death; the prophet's expression being, <span class= "ital">I will make it thy grave: for thou art found worthless</span> (lit. "light in the balance "--comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-27.htm" title="TEKEL; You are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.">Daniel 5:27</a>). "And it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-33.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.">Isaiah 37:33</a>). The allusion to Sennacherib's death in the temple of Nisroch appears to us unassailable. That it was admitted in the earliest times is shown by the accentuation and the translation given by the Targum. Keil's explanation that the "Assyrian power personified "is addressed, and that "I am preparing thy grave" is the true rendering, simply emasculates this vigorous passage. If, as is probable, Sennacherib's death had already occurred, it would be strange indeed that Nahum should make no mention of this memorable instance of Divine retribution, while at the same time using words so capable of bearing the allusion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concerning thee.</span> The prophet addresses the Assyrian, and announces God's purpose concerning him. <span class="cmt_word">That no more of thy name be sown.</span> There is no special reference to Sennacherib in this or the next clause, but the prophet means that the Assyrian people and name shall become extinct. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the house of thy gods</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>, whore the murder of Sennacherib in the temple of Nisroch is mentioned). An account of the religion of the Assyrians will be found in Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2 ch. 7. <span class="cmt_word">Graven image;</span> carved out of wood or stone. <span class="cmt_word">Molten</span>; cast in metal. The two terms comprise every kind of idol, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3</a>. The Assyrians used to destroy the images of the gods worshipped by conquered nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>). Bonomi ('Nineveh and its Palaces,' p. 163) gives a picture of soldiers cutting up the image of some foreign deity, and carrying away the pieces. So should it now be done unto their gods. <span class="cmt_word">I will make thy grave.</span> I will consign thee, O Assyrian, and thy idols to oblivion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22</a>, etc.). It is not, "I will make it, the temple, thy grave," as those who see a reference to the death of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>) render it; but, "I prepare thy grave" - I doom thee to destruction. The reason is given: <span class="cmt_word">For thou art vile;</span> <span class="accented">quia inhonoratus es</span> (Vulgate): <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "for they are swift" (Septuagint). The word is also translated "light," weighed in the balances, and found wanting, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-27.htm">Daniel 5:27</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-15 There is a great deal plotted against the Lord by the gates of hell, and against his kingdom in the world; but it will prove in vain. With some sinners God makes quick despatch; and one way or other, he will make an utter end of all his enemies. Though they are quiet, and many very secure, and not in fear, they shall be cut down as grass and corn, when the destroying angel passes through. God would hereby work great deliverance for his own people. But those who make themselves vile by scandalous sins, God will make vile by shameful punishments. The tidings of this great deliverance shall be welcomed with abundant joy. These words are applied to the great redemption wrought out by our Lord Jesus and the everlasting gospel, Ro 10:15. Christ's ministers are messengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. How welcome to those who see their misery and danger by sin! And the promise they made in the day of trouble must be made good. Let us be thankful for God's ordinances, and gladly attend them. Let us look forward with cheerful hope to a world where the wicked never can enter, and sin and temptation will no more be known.</body></html>
