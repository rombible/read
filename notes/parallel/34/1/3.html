To vindicate His power, Nahum, after the manner of other Hebrew poets and prophets, reverts to the wonders of the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nahum/1-4.htm" title="He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes.">Nahum 1:4-5</a>). The pillars of cloud and fire in the desert march; the quaking cliffs of Sinai; the Red Sea and Jordan divided at His word; Canaan succumbing at every point, upwards to mighty Lebanon in the north, and across from Eastern Bashan to Western Carmel--these are the testimonies to Jehovah's might. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/3-6.htm" title="He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.">Habakkuk 3:6-10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Slow to anger</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>). Nahum seems to take up the words of Jonah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>) or Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>).

(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97.htm">Psalm 97</a>.). The clouds are the dust of his feet, Large and grand as the clouds look to us, they are to God but as the dust raised by the feet in walking. As an illustration of this statement (though, of course, the fact was utterly unknown to Nahum), it has been remarked that recent scientific discovery asserts that clouds owe their beauty, and even their very existence, to the presence of dust particles in the atmosphere. The aqueous vapour, it is said, condenses on these particles, and thus becomes visible. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 About a hundred years before, at Jonah's preaching, the Ninevites repented, and were spared, yet, soon after, they became worse than ever. Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?</body></html>
