(For the utter destruction of Nineveh, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-13.htm">Zephaniah 2:13</a>, etc.) The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> ("those that rise up"). The Chaldee has a similar reading, with the meaning that God would exterminate those who rise up against him. <span class="cmt_word">Darkness shall pursue his enemies.</span> So the Septuagint and Vulgate. But it is better rendered, He <span class="accented">shall pursue his enemies into darkness</span>, so that they disappear from the earth. If this is the meaning of the clause, it resembles the termination of many Assyrian inscriptions which record the defeat of a hostile chieftain: "and no one has seen any trace of him since." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 About a hundred years before, at Jonah's preaching, the Ninevites repented, and were spared, yet, soon after, they became worse than ever. Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?</body></html>
