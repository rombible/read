The threefold repetition of the name of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> and the attribute "avenging" gives a wonderful force to this sublime description of the Divine character. God is here called <span class="accented">jealous</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint) anthropopothically, as ready to defend his honour against all who oppose him, as One who loves his people and punishes their oppressors. <span class="cmt_word">Is furious;</span> literally, master of fury, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-19.htm">Genesis 37:19</a>, "master of dreams." The Lord is full of wrath (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>:24; 29:22). The word used implies a permanent feeling, Hire the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He reserveth wrath.</span> The Hebrew is simply "watching," "observing" for punishment. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "himself cutting off his enemies;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">irascens ipse inimicis ejus</span>. God withholds his hand for a time, but does not forget. All this description of God's attributes is intended to show that the destruction of Assyria is his doing, and that its accomplishment is certain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 About a hundred years before, at Jonah's preaching, the Ninevites repented, and were spared, yet, soon after, they became worse than ever. Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?</body></html>
