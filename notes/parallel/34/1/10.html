(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-9.htm" title="Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.">Psalm 58:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm" title="They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.">Psalm 118:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm" title="For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>.) The verse compares the victims of Jehovah's wrath, first, to a compact bundle of thorn fagots; secondly, to a material equally combustible, the dry straw and stubble of the threshing-floor. With regard to the words "while steeped in their drink," it may be remarked that in the final siege of Nineveh a great defeat of its forces was effected by a surprise while the king and his captains were sunk in revelry (Diod. Sic. ii. 26). Benhadad, king of Syria, and Belshazzar, king of Babylon, were overcome under similar circumstances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-16.htm" title="And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What would you?">1Kings 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/5-1.htm" title="Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.">Daniel 5:1-30</a>). Feasting and revelry may have gone on in Sennacherib's camp at the moment when the sudden visitation of the "angel of the Lord" was impending; but on this point we have no information. The introduction of this detail adds to the metaphor a certain grim humour. Soaked in wine though the enemy be, he shall surely burn like driest fuel in the day of Jehovah's fiery wrath. The opening clause of the verse is beset with difficulties, both grammatical and lexical. Kleinert renders "For in thorns they shall be entangled," &c.; Ewald and Hitzig, "For even though they be compact as a wickerwork of thorns," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While they be folden together as thorns.</span> The clause is conditional: "Though they be interwined as thorns." Though the Assyrians present an impenetrable front, which seems to defy attack. (For the comparison of a hostile army to briers and thorns, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a>; Henderson.) <span class="cmt_word">And while they are drunken as drunkards</span>; <span class="accented">and though they be drunken with their drink</span>, regarding themselves as invincible, and drenched with wine, and given up to luxury and excess. There may be an allusion to the legend current concerning the destruction of Nineveh. Diodorus (2:26) relates that, after the enemy had been thrice repulsed, the King of Nineveh was so elated that he gave himself up to festivity, and allowed all his army to indulge in the utmost licence, and that it was while they were occupied in drunkenness and feasting they were surprised by the Medes under Cyaxares, and their city taken. An account of such a feast, accompanied with sketehes from the monuments, is given in Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Discoveries,' p. 187, etc. We may compare the fate of Belshazzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be devoured as stubble fully dry;</span> like worthless refuse, fit only for burning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>). The LXX. renders this verse differently, "Because to its foundation it shall be dried up (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="accented">redigentur in vepres</span>, Jerome), and as bind weed (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) intertwined it shall be devoured, and as stubble fully dry." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-15 There is a great deal plotted against the Lord by the gates of hell, and against his kingdom in the world; but it will prove in vain. With some sinners God makes quick despatch; and one way or other, he will make an utter end of all his enemies. Though they are quiet, and many very secure, and not in fear, they shall be cut down as grass and corn, when the destroying angel passes through. God would hereby work great deliverance for his own people. But those who make themselves vile by scandalous sins, God will make vile by shameful punishments. The tidings of this great deliverance shall be welcomed with abundant joy. These words are applied to the great redemption wrought out by our Lord Jesus and the everlasting gospel, Ro 10:15. Christ's ministers are messengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. How welcome to those who see their misery and danger by sin! And the promise they made in the day of trouble must be made good. Let us be thankful for God's ordinances, and gladly attend them. Let us look forward with cheerful hope to a world where the wicked never can enter, and sin and temptation will no more be known.</body></html>
