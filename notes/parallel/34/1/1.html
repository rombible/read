Some prefer to render it "utterance," or "oracle." The word is capable of either meaning. It almost always (except, perhaps, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>) introduces a threat of judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Of Nineveh.</span> The denunciation of this city is the object of the prophecy. The effect of Jonah's preaching had been only temporary; the reformation was partial and superficial; and now God's long suffering was wearied out, and the time of punishment was to come. (For an account of Nineveh, see note on Jonah 1:2.) Some critics have deemed one part of the title an interpolation; but the connection of the two portions is obvious, and without the former we should not know the object of the prophet's denunciation till <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-8.htm">Nahum 2:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The book of the vision.</span> This is the second title, in apposition with the former, and defining it more closely as the Book in which was written the prophecy of Nahum. It is called a "vision," because what the prophet foretold was presented to his mental sight, and stood plainly before him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Elkoshite;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> native of Elkosh, for which, see Introduction, &sect; II. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 About a hundred years before, at Jonah's preaching, the Ninevites repented, and were spared, yet, soon after, they became worse than ever. Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?</body></html>
