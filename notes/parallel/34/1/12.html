Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "Thus saith the Lord, ruling over many waters." So the Syriac and Arabic. Jerome interprets "the waters" to mean the heavenly powers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-4.htm">Psalm 148:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet thus</span> (though such is their state) <span class="cmt_word">shall they be cut down.</span> The verb is used of the mowing of a fold or the shearing of sheep, and implies complete destruction. <span class="cmt_word">When he shall pass through;</span> better, <span class="accented">and he shall pass away.</span> The number is changed, but the same persons are meant, spoken of as one to show their insignificance and complete annihilation. Septuagint "Thus shall they be dispersed [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="accented">dividentur</span>, Jerome], and the report of thee shall no more be heard therein." The following clause is not translated. <span class="cmt_word">Though I have afflicted thee.</span> The Lord addresses Judah, referring to the oppression of Judaea by the Assyriaus in the times of Ahaz and Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-18.htm">2 Kings 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20</a>, etc.; 32.). <span class="cmt_word">I will afflict thee no more;</span> according to the promise in ver. 9. This is further confirmed in what follows. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-15 There is a great deal plotted against the Lord by the gates of hell, and against his kingdom in the world; but it will prove in vain. With some sinners God makes quick despatch; and one way or other, he will make an utter end of all his enemies. Though they are quiet, and many very secure, and not in fear, they shall be cut down as grass and corn, when the destroying angel passes through. God would hereby work great deliverance for his own people. But those who make themselves vile by scandalous sins, God will make vile by shameful punishments. The tidings of this great deliverance shall be welcomed with abundant joy. These words are applied to the great redemption wrought out by our Lord Jesus and the everlasting gospel, Ro 10:15. Christ's ministers are messengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. How welcome to those who see their misery and danger by sin! And the promise they made in the day of trouble must be made good. Let us be thankful for God's ordinances, and gladly attend them. Let us look forward with cheerful hope to a world where the wicked never can enter, and sin and temptation will no more be known.</body></html>
