It is evidently the finale of the proclamation against the Assyrian invader, and rightly stands in the LXX. as the last verse of Nahum 2. It portrays the announcement of Sennacherib's fate to the towns and villages of Judah. "From mountain-top to mountain-top by beacon fires they spread the glad tidings. Suddenly the deliverance comes, sudden its announcement. <span class= "ital">Behold,</span> Judah, before hindered by armies from going up to Jerusalem, its cities taken, may now again <span class= "ital">keep the feasts</span> there, and <span class= "ital">pay the vows</span> which in trouble she promised; <span class= "ital">for the wicked one,</span> the ungodly Sennacherib, <span class= "ital">is utterly cut off; he shall no more pass through thee</span>" (Pusey). The opening clause necessarily reminds one of the description of deliverance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm" title="How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace; that brings good tidings of good, that publishes salvation; that said to Zion, Your God reigns!">Isaiah 52:7</a>. The one author probably borrows the language of the other; but which passage we regard as the original must depend on the view taken of the Book of Isaiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The second chapter commences here in the Hebrew and Syriac; the Anglican follows the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Chaldee Versions. This seems most agreeable to the method of the prophecy, wherein threat is succeeded by promise, denunciation of the enemy by declaration of comfort to Judah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6, 7, 12</a>, and 13; so here vers. 14 and 15). The prophet announces the joy with which Judah receives the news of the overthrow of Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">Behold upon the mountains,</span> etc. Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>) uses these words to proclaim the coming of Messiah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>). The messengers come from the East across the mountains of Palestine, announcing the fall of Nineveh and the consequent peace and security of Judah - a type of the overthrow of God's enemies and the safety of his Church. There may be an allusion to the custom of spreading tidings by beacon fires. <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy solemn feasts.</span> Judah is exhorted to resume the observation of her solemnities, which were interrupted during the enemy's occupation of the country, or which could not be properly attended by the distant inhabitants. Judah must offer her praises and thanksgivings for deliverance, and <span class="cmt_word">perform the vows</span> which she made unto the Lord in the time of peril. <span class="cmt_word">The wicked</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">Belial</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall no more pass through thee.</span> <span class="accented">Belial</span> is here the adversary, the opposing army (see ver. 11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-15 There is a great deal plotted against the Lord by the gates of hell, and against his kingdom in the world; but it will prove in vain. With some sinners God makes quick despatch; and one way or other, he will make an utter end of all his enemies. Though they are quiet, and many very secure, and not in fear, they shall be cut down as grass and corn, when the destroying angel passes through. God would hereby work great deliverance for his own people. But those who make themselves vile by scandalous sins, God will make vile by shameful punishments. The tidings of this great deliverance shall be welcomed with abundant joy. These words are applied to the great redemption wrought out by our Lord Jesus and the everlasting gospel, Ro 10:15. Christ's ministers are messengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. How welcome to those who see their misery and danger by sin! And the promise they made in the day of trouble must be made good. Let us be thankful for God's ordinances, and gladly attend them. Let us look forward with cheerful hope to a world where the wicked never can enter, and sin and temptation will no more be known.</body></html>
