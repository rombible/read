Perversion of religious instinct is frequently denounced under the same figure in Scripture. Here, however, a more literal interpretation is possible, since there is reason to believe the religious rites of Assyria were characterised, like those of Babylon, by gross sensuality. According to Herod, i. 199, the Babylonian worship of Beltis or Mylitta was connected with a system of female prostitution, which was deemed "most shameful" even by the heathen historian. Compare also the Apocryphal Book of Bar 6:43. The same deity was worshipped in Assyria. Professor Rawlinson writes: "It would seem to follow almost as a matter of course that the worship of the same identical goddess in the adjoining country included a similar usage. It may be to this practice that the prophet Nahum alludes when he denounces Nineveh as a 'well-favoured harlot,' the multitude of whose harlotries was notorious" (<span class= "ital">Five Great Monarchies,</span> ii. 41).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The cause is given that has brought this punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the multitude of the whoredoms.</span> This term is commonly applied to idolatry, the swerving from the true God and turning to false deities; and it is thought that it cannot be used in that sense here, as Assyria had always worshipped idols, and could not be said to have forsaken or proved false to the Lord. Hence Hitzig, Keil, and others refer the term to the treacherous friendship and crafty politics by which Nineveh ensnared other states, seeking really only her own interests (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>). But this habit of treachery has been already mentioned in ver. 1 (where see note); and, as Knabenbauer remarks, the Assyrians used no meretricious blandishments to effect their conquests, but the cruel arts of war and the stern ordeal of the sword. It is scarcely probable that the prophet would omit idolatry among the crimes of the Assyrians that called for vengeance, as all their wars were carried on in the name of their gods, and the monarchs professed to be under Divine protection and influence. The term "whoredom" is applied to the idolatry, not only of the Israelites, but to that of Jezebel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>), who was always a heathen. The idolatry of the Assyrians may very well be so called, because it was a wilful ignoring of the light of nature and natural religion (see Wisd. 13:1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>, etc.). They were careful, too, wherever they carried their arms, to erect there symbols of their deities, and to compel conquered nations to receive them and pay them Divine honour. With this idolatrous worship was associated that gross immorality which even Herodotus (1:199) termed utterly disgraceful (comp. Baruch 6:43). Rightly is Nineveh called <span class="cmt_word">the well favoured harlot</span>; for her splendour and magnificence were unsurpassed, dazzling all beholders and hiding the rottenness that lay below the surface. <span class="cmt_word">The mistress of witchcrafts.</span> She was skilful in employing every art to seduce nations to her side. We hear much of magic in connection with Babylon and the Chaldeans, but not in reference especially to Assyria. The expression here is metaphorical, alluding to the secret practices which she employed to gain her ends and to make her rule attractive (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That selleth nations.</span> Depriving them of freedom and making them tributary, or, in some cases, actually selling the inhabitants as slaves (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Families</span>.
