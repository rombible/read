Sleep the sleep of death - slain in the war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">O King of Assyria.</span> The power and evil of Nineveh personified, not any particular king. <span class="cmt_word">Shall dwell</span> in the dust; <span class="accented">are lying</span>, or <span class="accented">are at rest</span>, in death; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Put to sleep thy mighty men" (comp. Euripides, 'Hec.,' 473, where <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used in the sense of "to slay"): Vulgate, <span class="accented">sepelientur. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Is scattered upon the mountains.</span> Their shepherds being dead, the flock, the herd of common people, is scattered abroad and perishes, because <span class="cmt_word">no man gathereth</span> them - there is no one to collect them. "The mountains" referred to are those which shut in Assyria on the north. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-19 Strong-holds, even the strongest, are no defence against the judgments of God. They shall be unable to do any thing for themselves. The Chaldeans and Medes would devour the land like canker-worms. The Assyrians also would be eaten up by their own numerous hired troops, which seem to be meant by the word rendered merchants. Those that have done evil to their neighbours, will find it come home to them. Nineveh, and many other cities, states, and empires, have been ruined, and should be a warning to us. Are we better, except as there are some true Christians amongst us, who are a greater security, and a stronger defence, than all the advantages of situation or strength? When the Lord shows himself against a people, every thing they trust in must fail, or prove a disadvantage; but he continues good to Israel. He is a strong-hold for every believer in time of trouble, that cannot be stormed or taken; and he knoweth those that trust in Him.</body></html>
