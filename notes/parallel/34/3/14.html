The outer walls are broken down; let her hold out in the citadel. Nay, let her begin anew her preparations for defence. Let her lay in water and provision, and build new buttresses of brick. What shall it avail her? In the midst of her preparations, fire and sword shall again surprise her. The account of this last struggle for existence is minute. Nahum goes back to the repair of the brick-kiln, just as Isaiah, in his description of idol-worship, goes back to the smith working with the tongs, and the carpenter measuring with his rule (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-12.htm" title="The smith with the tongs both works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with the strength of his arms: yes, he is hungry, and his strength fails: he drinks no water, and is faint.">Isaiah 44:12</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In both cases the irony gains force by a minute and elaborate description of operations destined to be futile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-19.</span> - &sect; 3. <span class="accented">In spite of all its efforts and all its resources, Nineveh shall meet with a terrible end.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Nahum ironically bids the Ninevites prepare for the siege they were about to sustain. <span class="cmt_word">Draw thee waters for the siege.</span> The drinking water necessary for a long siege is meant. This injunction is not particularly applicable to Nineveh, which from its situation was abundantly supplied with water, unless there was danger that the enemy would divert the courses of the rivers. But the warning would come home with peculiar force to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, among whom Nahum prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fortify thy strong holds</span>; <span class="accented">strengthen thy fortresses.</span> Repair all defects in thy defences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-11.htm">2 Chronicles 11:11</a>). The mode of doing this in the Assyrian fashion is then denoted. <span class="cmt_word">Go into clay, and tread the mortar.</span> The soil round Nineveh was of a tenacious quality; and when moistened with water and kneaded either with feet or hands, with the addition usually of a little chopped straw, was easily formed into bricks. These, even without the aid of fire, became dry and hard in the course of a few days. But it is plain from the investigations of ruins that the Assyrians used both kiln-baked and sun-dried bricks, though the mass of the walls was usually composed of the latter, the more durable material being employed merely as an accessory (see Bouomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' p. 9; Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:252). Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 3:4. 11, speaks of the brick wall (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of a town he calls Mespila. <span class="cmt_word">Make strong the brick kiln.</span> There is an uncertainty about the meaning of the last word (<span class="accented">malben</span>), which occurs only in two other places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9</a>). In the latter passage it may possibly mean "a square" or "open quadrangle." Jerome has, <span class="accented">tene laterem</span>; the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> "make them strong above (equivalent to 'stronger than') brick," connecting it with the following verse. Some translate it, "brick mould." If the Anglican Version is correct, the prophet bids them repair their kilns, unused in the days of prosperity, when they had no need to look to the security of their walls. Virtually the same sense is elicited by rendering, "lay hold of the brick mould." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-19 Strong-holds, even the strongest, are no defence against the judgments of God. They shall be unable to do any thing for themselves. The Chaldeans and Medes would devour the land like canker-worms. The Assyrians also would be eaten up by their own numerous hired troops, which seem to be meant by the word rendered merchants. Those that have done evil to their neighbours, will find it come home to them. Nineveh, and many other cities, states, and empires, have been ruined, and should be a warning to us. Are we better, except as there are some true Christians amongst us, who are a greater security, and a stronger defence, than all the advantages of situation or strength? When the Lord shows himself against a people, every thing they trust in must fail, or prove a disadvantage; but he continues good to Israel. He is a strong-hold for every believer in time of trouble, that cannot be stormed or taken; and he knoweth those that trust in Him.</body></html>
