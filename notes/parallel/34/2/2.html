But Jehovah has allowed its hedge to be broken down. "All they that go by do pluck her . . ." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/80-12.htm" title="Why have you then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?">Psalm 80:12-13</a>). In the punishment of one notoriously oppressive world-power the prophet sees a pledge that the branch of Jehovah shall be again "beautiful and glorious" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>). The construction in the first part of the verse is perplexing. It appears best to attach a special emphasis to the names "Jacob" and "Israel" in connection with their original signification. "Jacob" is the birth-name--the nation regarded apart from its religious privileges, the homeless exile, the downtrodden "worm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-14.htm" title="Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, said the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 41:14</a>), the younger son among nations. But "Israel" is the chosen of God; he who "had power over the angel and prevailed"; the "beloved son, called out of Egypt." The name given by Jehovah is henceforth to have its full significance, as in the days of old. "Jacob," the name which is so often used after the deportation of the ten tribes, is again to be indicated as "Israel," the favoured people of God. Some commentators render, "For Jehovah restores alike the glory of Jacob and the glory of Israel," &c., making "Jacob" the designation of the southern, "Israel" that of the northern kingdom. But the term "Jacob" nowhere else has this distinctive force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This ruin shall fall on Nineveh because God is mindful of his chosen people, whom Assyria has oppressed. <span class="cmt_word">Hath turned away.</span> It should be rendered, <span class="accented">returneth to</span>, or <span class="accented">restoreth, bringeth back</span>; <span class="accented">reddidit</span> (Vulgate); <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel.</span> The Lord restores the glory and honour of Jacob, the nation in its political aspect, and the high privileges of the spiritual Israel, the chosen people of God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.

God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls!</body></html>
