"Sardanapalus is said to have placed a hundred and fifty golden beds, and as many tables of the same metal, on his funeral pile, besides gold and silver vases and ornaments in enormous quantities, and purple and many-coloured raiments (Athen., lib. 12.). According to Diodorus, the value of the gold taken from the temple of Bolus alone by Xerxes amounted to above 7350 Attic talents, of &pound;21,000,000 sterling money" (Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:416, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-1.htm">Daniel 3:1</a>, where the size of the golden image or pillar, sixty cubits high and six cubits broad, shows how plentiful was gold in these countries). Bonomi: "The riches of Nineveh are inexhaustible, her vases and precious furniture are infinite, copper constantly occurs in their weapons, and it is most probable a mixture of it was used in the materials of their tools. They had acquired the art of making glass.... The well known cylinders are a sufficient proof of their skill in engraving gems. Many beautiful specimens of carving in ivory were also discovered .... The condition of the ruins is highly corroborative of the sudden destruction that came upon Nineveh by fire and sword .... It is evident from the ruins that both Khorsabad and Nimroud were sacked and then set on fire. Neither Botta nor Layard found any of that store of silver and gold and 'pleasant furniture' which the palaces contained; scarcely anything, even of bronze, escaped the spoiler" ('Nineveh and its Discoveries,' pp. 334, 336). <span class="cmt_word">There is none end of the store;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Non finis est divitiarum</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "There was no end of her ornament." <span class="cmt_word">And glory out of all the pleasant furniture;</span> literally, <span class="accented">vessels of desire.</span> It is plainer to translate, <span class="accented">There is abundance of all precious furniture.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Nineveh shall not put aside this judgment; there is no counsel or strength against the Lord. God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls!</body></html>
