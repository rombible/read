Both Medes and Babylonians were engaged in the present siege. The rest of the verse runs, <span class= "ital">the chariots are</span> [equipped] <span class= "ital">with flashing steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress lances are brandished.</span> The "flashing steel" may refer to ornaments of this material attached to the chariot, or, as we incline to think, to scythes or sharp instruments fastened to the wheels. Some form of this weapon may well have been in use long before the present date. Xenophon relates that Cyrus was the first to introduce the scythe-chariot. Ctesias, however, speaks of it as of much earlier origin. The older Hebrew commentators render this word <span class= "ital">p</span>'<span class= "ital">ladoth,</span> "torches," as in the Authorised Version. With this rendering, the swiftly-moving war-chariots are likened to flashing torches, as they are in the next verse.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nahum/2-4.htm" title="The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightning.">Nahum 2:4-5</a> describe the state of the city while sustaining this siege. There is a slight contrast between this portraiture and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm" title="The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.">Nahum 2:3</a>, which has been made the most of by Kleinert. "Without, God arranges His hosts; within is the disorder of wild terror: without, a steady approach against the city; within, a frantic rushing hither and thither: without, a joyful splendour; within, a deadly paleness, like torch-light." The last part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm" title="The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightning.">Nahum 2:4</a> is thus made a description of the aspect of the Ninevites, not their chariots. This appears to us a fanciful interpretation. In its behalf, the description of a panic in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm" title="And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travails: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.">Isaiah 13:8</a> has been adduced: "They shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as <span class= "ital">flames.</span>" But it is obviously better to restrict the reference throughout to the chariots of the besieged city, darting hither and thither in wild undisciplined attempts to resist the invader's onset.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The prophet describes, as though himself an eyewitness, the army advancing against Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">The shield of his mighty men is made red.</span> "His heroes" may be either God's heroes, as sent by him to war against the evil city, or those of the "dasher in pieces" of ver. 1. The shields of the early Assyrians were usually circular or oval in shape, formed of wicker work, with a central boss of wood or metal. In the latest period they were made straight at bottom and rounded only at top (Rawlinson's 'Anc. Mon.,' 1:440). Some bronze shields have been brought to England from Nineveh; these are circular, about two feet and a half in diameter, the rim bending inwards, and forming a deep groove round the edge. The handles are of iron, and fastened by six bosses or nails, the heads of which form an ornament on the outer face of the shield (Layard, 'Discoveries,' p. 194). There were used also in sieges tall oblong shields, sufficient to protect the entire body, constructed of wicker work or the hides of animals (Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Discoveries,' p. 320, etc.). The shields are said to be "made red," either because they were really so coloured (though the monuments have not confirmed this opinion), or else because of the polished copper with which they were sometimes covered (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:12. 5). Septuagint, pointing differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the arms of their power from among men." <span class="cmt_word">Are in scarlet.</span> The word rendered "scarlet" is found nowhere else. Septuagint, mistaking the word, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, "sporting in fire:" Vulgate, in <span class="accented">coccineis</span>. It is derived from the term applied to the <span class="accented">coccus</span>, or worm which was used in dyeing to give to cloth a deep scarlet colour (Henderson). Some have seen in the colour of the soldiers' garments an emblem of the Divine wrath of which they were the appointed ministers. This colour was much affected by combatants in old times as in modern days. Professor Edwards quotes Aelian, 'Var. Hist.' 6:6, "it was necessary to enter into battle clothed in purple, that the colour might denote a certain dignity, and if drops of blood from wounds were sprinkled on it, it became terrible to the enemy" (comp. Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 1:3, 2). Red or purple seems to have been the favourite colour of the Medea and Babylonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>), blue or violet that of the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-23.htm">Ezekiel 28:23</a>, etc.) (Orelli). <span class="cmt_word">The chariots shall be with flaming torches;</span> literally, <span class="accented">are with fire of steels</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> flash with steel, and so the clause should be translated, as in the Revised Version. Commentators generally refer the description to the steel bosses of the wheels; but the Assyrian chariots (and those of the Medes and Chaldeans were not dissimilar) were conspicuous for shining metal, hung round with gleaming weapons and figures of the heavenly bodies, carrying bright armed warriors, the homes covered with trappings, which flashed under the sunshine, and fastened to poles of glittering steel. There is no trace in the monuments of chariots armed with scythes, which seem to have been unknown before the time of Cyrus. They are first mentioned in 2 Macc. 13:2 (see Livy, 37:41). The word <span class="accented">peladoth</span>, translated "torches," is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The LXX. renders it, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "the reins," whence Jerome obtained his version, <span class="accented">igneae habenae curruum</span>; but it means, "things made of iron or steel,"and by critics uninstructed in monumental discoveries was naturally referred to the scythes with which chariots were armed in later times, instead of to the gleaming metal with which they were adorned. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of his preparation.</span> When the Lord marshals the host for battle, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The fir trees shall be terribly shaken,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the spears with their fir or cypress shafts are brandished. So Homer often calls the spear "the ash," from the material of which the handle was made (comp. 'Il.,' 16:143; 22:225, etc.). The Septuagint rendering is very far from the present text, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "The horsemen shall be thrown into confusion." Nor is the Vulgate any better, <span class="accented">Agitatores cosopiti sunt</span>, which is explained to mean that the invaders are so carried away by their courage and fury, that they act as if intoxicated. "Sensus utique non spernedus," says a Roman Catholic commentator, "at unum desidero, ut scil. ex verbo ipso fluat" - which is certainly not the case. The text is possibly corrupt, and might be corrected from the Septuagint. Certainly there seems to be no other passage in the Hebrew Scriptures where the metaphor of "cypress" is used for "a spear." After the mention of the chariots, it is not unnatural that the writer should proceed, "and the riders are in active motion," urging their horses with hand and whip and gesture (see Knabenbauer, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Nineveh shall not put aside this judgment; there is no counsel or strength against the Lord. God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls!</body></html>
