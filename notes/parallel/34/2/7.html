We may dismiss the idea that <span class="accented">Huzzab</span> is the name of the queen. Such a personage is unknown to history; and there is no reason why she should be mentioned rather than the king; and persona are not introduced by name in prophecy except for some very special reason, as Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). The alternative rendering, "it is decreed," adopted by Keil, Pusey, and many modern commentators, is unexampled, and comes in baldly, and not at all according to the prophet's manner. Henderson joins the clause with the proceiling, thus: "The palace is dissolved, though firmly established."

Thus Egypt is called Rahab, "arrogant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>); the King of Assyria, <span class="accented">Jareb</span>, "contentious" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>); Jerusalem, <span class="accented">Ariel</span>, "God's lion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be led away captive;</span> better, <span class="accented">is</span> <span class="accented">laid</span> <span class="accented">bare</span>.

Yet for such things how many lose their souls!</body></html>
