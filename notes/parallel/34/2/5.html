The Assyrian king bethinks him of his stoutest warriors, but they <span class= "ital">stumble in their paths</span> in nervous perplexity. Men ran to the city wall, but against it the besiegers have already erected their storming-shed--a proceeding which ought to have been prevented by the discharge of stones and other missiles from the walls. The storming-shed protected the battering-rams. Of the representations of these preserved in the monuments of Nineveh, Professor Rawlinson thus writes: "All of them were covered with a framework, which was of osier wood, felt, or skins, for the better protection of those who worked the implement. . . . Some appear to have been stationary, others provided with wheels. . . . Again, sometimes combined with the ram and its framework was a movable tower containing soldiers, who at once fought the enemy on a level, and protected the engine from their attacks (<span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies,</span> i. 470).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The prophet turns to the Ninevites and their preparations for defence. <span class="cmt_word">He shall recount his worthies;</span> <span class="accented">he remembers his nobles.</span> The King of Nineveh calls to mind the mighty captains who have often led his armies to victory, and sends them to defend the walls (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>). The LXX., anticipating the next clause, adds here, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "and they shall flee by day." <span class="cmt_word">They shall stumble in their walk.</span> In their fear and baste, or half drunken, they totter and stumble as they hasten to the walls of the city. <span class="cmt_word">The defence shall be prepared;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the covering is prepared.</span> If this refers to the operations of the Ninevites, it means some kind of breastwork or fascine erected between the towers; but it most probably depicts the sight that meets their eyes from the wails. They see the besiegers bringing up their mantelets and towers. As used by the Assyrians, the machine called "the covering" is either a wooden tower or a wicker mantelet in which was suspended a battering ram. It stood on four or six wheels, and the larger sort had archers posted in the various stories, both to annoy the enemy and to defend the engine. The rams were provided with lance headed extremities, and must have rather picked at and loosened the courses of bricks of which the walls were composed than battered them down (see Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' pp. 160, 234, 243, etc. Layard, 'Nineveh,' ch. 5. p. 376, etc., figs. 57, 58). The Septuagint rendering applies rather to the besieged, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "They shall prepare their defences." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Nineveh shall not put aside this judgment; there is no counsel or strength against the Lord. God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls!</body></html>
