A panic thereupon seizes the inhabitants. If the present text be maintained, the rendering of the Authorised Version will stand. We may then suppose the heterogeneous population of Nineveh to be compared to "countless drops, full, untroubled, with no ebb or flow, fenced in from the days that she hath been, yet even therefore stagnant and corrupted; not 'a fountain of living waters'" (Pusey). But this appears to us a farfetched comparison.<p>The pregnant terseness of the last part of the verse will give the English reader a good idea of Nahum's style and the difficulties therewith connected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The prophet compares the past and present condition of Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water;</span> <span class="accented">and</span> (or, <span class="accented">though</span>) <span class="accented">Nineveh hath been like a pool of water all her days.</span> Others, altering the points in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate, translate, "But as for Nineveh, her waters are like a pool of water." This is what she has come to, for "her waters" represent herself. She is compared to a pool or reservoir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-15.htm">Nehemiah 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>) from the multitude of her inhabitants gathered from all parts of the world, and streaming unto her, both as tributary and for commercial purposes (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet they shall flee away.</span> In spite of their numbers, the multitudes represented by "the waters" fly before the enemy.

God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls!</body></html>
