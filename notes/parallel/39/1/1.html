The word of the Lord is heavy and full of threats, but, as St. Jerome notes, it is also consolatory, because it is not "against" but to Israel. By this name the whole covenanted nation is designated, here, perhaps, with some idea of reminding the people of Jacob's faith and patience, and stimulating them to imitate their great ancestor. <span class="cmt_word">By Malachi;</span> literally, <span class="accented">by the hand of Malachi</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>). That Malachi is the proper name of the prophet, and not a mere official designation, see the proof in the Introduction, &sect; II. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "by the hand of his angel," or" messenger," and some curious theories have been founded on this translation; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that an angel was the real author of the book, or came and explained it to the people. A similar legend once obtained concerning Haggai, called" The Lord's Messenger" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>). At the end of the verse the LXX. adds, "fix it in your hearts," which Jerome supposes to have been imported hither from <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 All advantages, either as to outward circumstances, or spiritual privileges, come from the free love of God, who makes one to differ from another. All the evils sinners feel and fear, are the just recompence of their crimes, while all their hopes and comforts are from the unmerited mercy of the Lord. He chose his people that they might be holy. If we love him, it is because he has first loved us; yet we all are prone to undervalue the mercies of God, and to excuse our own offences.</body></html>
