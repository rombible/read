(1) One who acts deceitfully (by offering a <span class= "ital">female</span> as a <span class= "ital">burnt offering,</span> which is contrary to the Law, while there is in his flock a <span class= "ital">male</span>); (2) and one who makes <span class= "ital">a vow</span> (to offer a <span class= "ital">sacrifice of peace offerings,</span> for which either a male or a female was allowable, provided it were without a blemish: <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-23.htm" title="Either a bullock or a lamb that has any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.">Leviticus 22:23</a>), and then offers an animal that has a blemish. But it is better to understand but one case to be mentioned--viz., that of a man who <span class= "ital">vows,</span> and while he has a <span class= "ital">male</span> in his flock offers a <span class= "ital">female with a blemish.</span> A female without blemish would be admissible as a <span class= "ital">vow offering,</span> but a male without blemish would be the most valuable, because it could be offered as a burnt offering, whereas a female could not; while a female with a blemish would be the very worst, and actually illegal. A man is not bound to make a vow, but if he make one his offering should be of the very best, just as he would not dare to offer to a king or to his ruler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm" title="A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And you say, Wherein have we despised your name?">Malachi 1:6</a>) anything but the best. How cursed, then, must he be who, while he possesses the best, deliberately makes a vow to God, and then offers Him the very worst.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">cursed be the deceiver.</span> The curse is fulminated against all who are guilty of these violations of the Law. The prophet mentions two instances out of many. The first is of one who offers a female victim, on pretence that he has no male in his flock. This will be clearer if we translate, with Keil, "And cursed is he who deceives, whereas there is in his flock a male animal." Septuagint, "Cursed is he who was able and bad in his flock a male." <span class="cmt_word">And voweth...a corrupt</span> (<span class="accented">blemished</span>) <span class="cmt_word">thing</span>. The second case is of one who in some emergency vows an offering, and then pays it by presenting a blemished animal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1, 6</a>). With a slightly altered punctuation, some editors give, "a faulty female." <span class="cmt_word">For I am a great King.</span> This is the reason that they are cursed who dishonour him. <span class="cmt_word">Dreadful</span>. Held in awe and reverence. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span>, notable." He whom the Gentiles honour will not permit his own people to profane his Name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests. Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and stinginess, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.</body></html>
