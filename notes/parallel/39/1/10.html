The rebuke contained in this verse is, according to this interpretation, very similar to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>. But the word "even," which can only refer to "you" (Keil thinks differently), seems to us almost fatal to this interpretation. For we could only explain its use in the forced sense of: "Would that some one, among even you (who ought to be the promoters of God's service), would (since His service has now become a mockery) shut, &c." We are therefore inclined to retain the simple rendering of our venerable English Version. In that case, "even among you" (perhaps better, <span class= "ital">among even you</span>) would mean: "even among you whose duty it is, and chief pleasure it ought to be, to minister unto Me," which, in that context, so far from being forced, would be most natural.<p><span class= "bld">For nought.</span>--Comp. the attitude of the priests in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;">1Samuel 2:13-16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The prophet continues his severe reprobation of the priests. <span class="cmt_word">Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for naught,</span> etc.? Thus rendered, the passage rebukes the mercenary spirit of the priests, who would not even shut the temple door nor kindle the altar fire unless they were paid for it; or else it means that, though all the officers of the temple were remunerated for their most trivial services, yet they were remiss in attending to their duties, and neglected the law of sacrifices. The Latin Version omits the negative in the last clause, <span class="accented">Quis est in vobis qui claudat ostia, et incendat altare meum gratuito?</span> The LXX., with some little variation in the reading, renders, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "Wherefore also among you the doors shall be shut, and my altar shall not be kindled for nothing," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God threatens that the temple services shall wholly cease. But it is best to consider the passage as continuing the sarcastic strain of the preceding verse, and saying in effect that it would be better to have no pretence of worship at all than to have it thus profaned. Translate as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain!</span> The doors are those of the inner court of the temple, where the great altar stood; and the polluted sectaries is offered "in vain," because it offends God rather than propitiates him. <span class="cmt_word">An offering</span> (<span class="accented">minchah</span>). Here not sacrifice in general, as many commentators suppose, because it would be unnatural to take the word in one sense in this verse, and in a different sense in the following, where it is confessedly used in its restricted signification. The term is applied technically to the offering of fine flour combined with off and frankincense, burnt on the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, etc.); though it is also occasionally used even of bloody sacrifices; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of Abel's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-17.htm">1 Samuel 2:17</a>). As liturgically employed, it denotes the unbloody offering. So in this verse we may note a kind of climax. God would not accept the victims sacrificed, no, nor even the meat offering, which was naturally pure and unpolluted, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests. Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and stinginess, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.</body></html>
