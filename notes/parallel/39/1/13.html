The service of the Temple, which they ought to have regarded as their highest privilege and pleasure, they look on as burdensome and contemptible. For "brought," read <span class= "ital">bring.</span><p><span class= "bld">Torn.</span>--The word <span class= "ital">Gaz-l</span> elsewhere means "stolen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-31.htm" title="Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat thereof: your ass shall be violently taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have none to rescue them.">Deuteronomy 28:31</a>), or "robbed "--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "spoiled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm" title="And you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and spoiled ever more, and no man shall save you.">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>). It is perhaps not impossible that it may here be a later word for <span class= "ital">trephah,</span> "torn" (comp. the cogn. Arabic <span class= "ital">ajzal,</span> "galled on the back"), but it is not so used in post-Biblical Jewish writings. On the contrary, Rabbinic tradition uses our word when expressly mentioning <span class= "ital">that which is stolen</span> as unfit to be offered as a burnt offering--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the Sifr?, (<span class= "ital">Vayyikr?,</span> Perek 6, Parashta 5, <span class= "ital">ed.</span> Weis 7<span class= "ital">b</span>), commenting on the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10</a>, says: " 'From the flock,' and 'from the sheep,' and 'from the goats:' These words are limitations--viz., to exclude the sick (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-8.htm" title="And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you, or accept your person? said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:8</a>), and the aged, and that which has been dedicated in thought to an idol, and that which is defiled with its own filth; 'its offering' [English Version, <span class= "ital">his offering,</span> comp.

Perhaps the reason why people were inclined to offer a stolen animal may be, that it might very likely have a mark on it, which would render it impossible for the thief to offer it for sale, and so realise money on it, for fear of detection; so then he makes a virtue of a necessity, and brings as an offering to God that which he could not otherwise dispose of.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What a weariness is it!</span> The reference is to the table of the Lord. Despising the altar, and performing their duties without heart or faith, the priests found the services an intolerable burden. Vulgate, <span class="accented">ecce de labore</span>, which seems to be an excuse of the people, urging that they offer such things as their toil and poverty allow. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, which has much the same meaning. The present Hebrew text is represented by the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have snuffed at it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the altar. The phrase expresses contempt. "It" has been supposed to be a "scribes' correction" for "me." The Septuagint and Syriac give, "I snorted at them." <span class="cmt_word">That which was torn;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that which was taken by violence</span> - that which was stolen or unjustly taken. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>: Ecclus. 34:18 (31:21), "He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>)" <span class="cmt_word">Lame... sick</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19-25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thus ye brought an</span> (<span class="accented">bring the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">offering</span> (<span class="accented">minchah</span>). Subject to analogous defects is even your meat offering, the accessory to other sacrifices, and therefore it is unacceptable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests. Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and stinginess, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.</body></html>
