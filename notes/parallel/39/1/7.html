"Polluted me" is the same as "profaned [my name]" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-12.htm" title="But you have profaned it, in that you say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.">Malachi 1:12</a>); for in the Hebrew Scriptures "God" and "God's name" are often equivalent expressions (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm" title="My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid before my name.">Malachi 2:5</a>). Keil takes the words, which he wrongly translates, "<span class= "ital">ye that offer polluted bread,</span>" as parallel to the words "despisers of my name," and to a certain degree explanatory of them; while he finds the actual answer to the questions, "Wherein have we despised?" "Wherein have we polluted?" is given in the words, "In that ye say," &c. He renders the passage thus:--<p>Saith the Lord of hosts unto you,<p>"Ye priests, who despise my name!"<p>And yet say, "Wherein have we despised thy name?"<p>"Ye who offer on mine altar polluted food."<p>And yet say, "Wherein have we polluted thee?"<p>(<span class= "ital">Ans.</span>) [Ye have despised my name and polluted me], in that ye say, "The table of the Lord is contemptible."<p>The error of this rendering consists in supposing that "offering polluted food," which is anathrous, can be parallel to "Ye priests who despise my name," which is defined by the definite article. In truth, the English Version is perfectly correct. We will repeat it with only the slightest possible verbal alterations. and with such parenthetical explanations as are required to make it quite intelligible:--Saith the Lord of hosts unto you, "O priests, that <span class= "ital">despise</span> my name!"<p>[This is the commencement of a prophetic rebuke to the priests; but they, in accordance with the prophet's graphic style of writing, are supposed to catch him up at the first clause of his utterance.]<p>"But" [despisers of God's name!] say ye, "wherein have we <span class= "ital">despised</span> thy name?"<p>(<span class= "ital">Ans.</span>) "Offering [as ye do] <span class= "ital">polluted</span> food upon mine altar."<p>" But," say ye, "wherein have we <span class= "ital">polluted</span> thee?"<p>(<span class= "ital">Ans.</span>) "When, now, ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?" &c.<p><span class= "bld">Say</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., show by your conduct that such is your feeling. </span>"This was their inward thought . . . he puts these thoughts into abrupt, bold, hard words, which might startle them for their hideousness, as if he would say, this is what your acts mean. He exhibits the worm and the decay which lay under the whited exterior."--<span class= "ital">Pusey.</span><p><span class= "bld">Table</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> <span class= "ital">altar,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-22.htm" title="The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before the LORD.">Ezekiel 41:22</a> : "The altar . . . this is the table that is before the Lord." (Comp. Ezek. 49:16.)]<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye offer polluted bread</span> (<span class="accented">food</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>upon mine altar.</span> The prophet answers the priests simply by detailing some of their practices. The "bread" (<span class="accented">lechem</span>) is not the shewbread, which was not offered on the altar, but the flesh of the offered victims (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-25.htm">Leviticus 22:25</a>). This was "polluted" in that it was not offered in due accordance with the ceremonial Law, as is further explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein have we polluted thee?</span> They did not acknowledge the truth that (as St. Jerome says) "when the sacraments are violated, he himself, whose sacraments they are, is violated" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The table of the Lord is contemptible.</span> This was the thought of their heart, if they did not give open expression to it in words. The "table of the Lord" (ver. 12) is the altar, on which were laid the sacrifices, regarded as the food. of God, and to be eaten by the fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-16.htm">Ezekiel 44:16</a>). They showed that they despised the altar by fancying that anything was good enough for offering thereon, as the next verse explains. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests. Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and stinginess, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.</body></html>
