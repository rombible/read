The meaning is: "By means of <span class= "ital">you</span> (priests), who ought to have directed the people aright, has this disgraceful conduct been occasioned." Or, perhaps, in view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-8.htm" title="And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you, or accept your person? said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:8</a>, and the wording of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-10.htm" title="Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nothing? neither do you kindle fire on my altar for nothing. I have no pleasure in you, said the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.">Malachi 1:10</a>, we should render the words thus: "From <span class= "ital">your</span> hands is this [despicable offering] !" <span class= "ital">This</span> being used contemptuously like Lat. <span class= "ital">istud.</span> In either case the clause is parenthetical, so that "will he regard" must be taken in close connection with the preceding, "beseech God that he will be gracious unto us."<p><span class= "bld">Will he regard your persons?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">will he, on your account, show favour to </span>'<span class= "ital">any one?</span> That is, can ye be deemed worthy intercessors, when these are the actions ye perform?

Come now and ask the favour of God with your polluted sacrifices; intercede, as is your duty, for the people; will he accept you? will he be gracious to the people for your sakes? <span class="cmt_word">This hath been by your means.</span> These words form a parenthesis, implying that it was from the priests that the evil custom of offering blemished animals proceeded, and they were answerable for the consequences; that their intercessions were vain was the result of their transgressions in these matters. Others interpret, "The thing depends on you," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether God shows favour or not. <span class="cmt_word">Will he regard your persons?</span> Will he show favour to any one because ye intercede for him?

Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and stinginess, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.</body></html>
