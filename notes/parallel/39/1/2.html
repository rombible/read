But not so.<p><span class= "bld">I loved Jacob, (3) and I hated Esau . . .</span>--The ethical reason for God's love of Jacob and hatred of Esau is not touched upon here, nor is it necessary to the argument. It is God's <span class= "ital">love</span> for Israel that the prophet wishes to dwell on, and he mentions the hatred towards Esau merely for the sake of a strong contrast. The nations, Israel and Edom, are here referred to, not the individuals, Jacob and Esau. This passage receives a graphic illustration from the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7</a>, composed after the return from the captivity: "<span class= "ital">Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.</span>" (On St. Paul's application of the words of Malachi, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-13.htm" title="As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.">Romans 9:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Laid his mountains . . . waste . . .</span>--It is a somewhat disputed point to what historical fact this refers. But, on the whole, we may reasonably infer from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm" title="Concerning Edom, thus said the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?">Jeremiah 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/49-17.htm" title="Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.">Jeremiah 49:17-21</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm" title="Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, said the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.">Jeremiah 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-21.htm" title="Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,">Jeremiah 25:21</a>, that the subjugation of the Edomites by Nebuchadnezzar is here referred to.<p><span class= "bld">Dragons.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">jackals.</span> The LXX. and Gesenius render the word "habitations," by comparison with a similarly sounding Arabic word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2-5.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The prophet declares God's special love for Israel</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have loved you.</span> The prophet, desiring to bring home to the people their ingratitude, lays down his thesis; then, in his characteristic manner, repeats the objection of the sceptics in an interrogatory form, and refutes it by plain argument. God had shown his love for Israel by electing them to be his people, and by his treatment of them during the whole course of their history. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein hast thou loved us!</span> This was the inward feeling of the people at this time. They doubted God's love and faithfulness. Events had not turned out as they expected. They had, indeed, returned from captivity, and the temple was rebuilt; but none of the splendid things announced by the prophets had come to pass. They were not great and victorious; Messiah had not appeared. Therefore they repined and murmured: they were ungrateful for past favours, and questioned God's power and providence. <span class="cmt_word">Was not Esau Jacob's brother?</span> God refutes their unjust charge by referring them to a palpable fact, viz. the different fate of the descendants of the twin brothers, Esau and Jacob. How miserable the destiny of the Edomites! how comparatively fortunate the condition of the Israelites! <span class="cmt_word">Yet I loved Jacob.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 All advantages, either as to outward circumstances, or spiritual privileges, come from the free love of God, who makes one to differ from another. All the evils sinners feel and fear, are the just recompence of their crimes, while all their hopes and comforts are from the unmerited mercy of the Lord. He chose his people that they might be holy. If we love him, it is because he has first loved us; yet we all are prone to undervalue the mercies of God, and to excuse our own offences.</body></html>
