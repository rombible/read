What "they that feared the Lord" said is not recorded; but it is implied, by His approval of them, that they strengthened one another in their faith and reliance on the goodness and faithfulness of the Lord, in spite of the present appearance of things. As the godless in Israel conversed together, so did the godly; but the converse of the one was the very reverse of the converse of the other. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-4.htm" title="Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.">Ezra 9:4</a> we read of such a consultation among those "that trembled at the word of the God of Israel." (Comp. the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm" title="My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid before my name.">Malachi 2:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Book of remembrance.</span>--In which men's actions are said figuratively to be recorded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-8.htm" title="You tell my wanderings: put you my tears into your bottle: are they not in your book?">Psalm 56:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm" title="A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.">Daniel 7:10</a>, &c.). Compare the custom of the Persian kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-1.htm" title="On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.">Esther 6:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., for their future reward.</span><p><span class= "bld">Thought upon</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, <span class= "ital">valued, esteemed.</span><p>(16) <span class= "bld">Then shall ye . . . between.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Then shall ye again perceive the difference between.</span> For the construction, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-1.htm" title="And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.">Zechariah 4:1</a>. As in former cases God had made this difference manifest, so He would again. Compare, for instance, the difference between the case of the Egyptians and of the Israelites in the matter of the miraculous darkness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-23.htm" title="They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.">Exodus 10:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - With these impious murmurers the prophet contrasts those who fear God, as above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5-7</a>) he set the picture of the true priest in opposition to his delineation of the evil ministers. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. When the impious made the above infidel remarks, the pious spake often, conversed together. What they said is not repeated, but it was language well pleasing unto God, who deigned to listen to their words, and to console them by announcing the future destiny of the good and the evil. They may have argued with these impious talkers, and warned others against them; or they may have expostulated as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>, but yet with full faith that what God does is always good; and this sentiment was all the harder to cherish because they lived under a system of temporal rewards and punishments. The Septuagint and Syriac have, "These things spake they that feared the Lord," as if the two preceding verses reported the words of the pious. Some Fathers and commentators have taken the same view. But it is difficult to conceive such words coming from the mouth of those who fear God; unless they are so called ironically. But this is inadmissible, as we see that in the present verse they are represented in their true character, and such a sudden change from irony to actuality is unnatural and quite opposed to the prophet's usual manner. <span class="cmt_word">A book of remembrance was written before him.</span> The hook represents God's providence and omniscience, his ever-wakeful care, his unfailing knowledge. "Are not these things noted in thy book?" says the psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>); and when the dead were judged, Daniel saw that the books were opened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). The idea is taken from the national records wherein were noted events of importance, such as we find in the cuneiform inscriptions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-41.htm">1 Kings 11:41</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-15.htm">Ezra 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). This book was to lie, as it were, always before the eyes of the Lord, to remind him of the pious. Rosenmuller compares the proverbial saying, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "It is written on the tablets of Zeus" on which Erasmus comments in his 'Adagia,' under the title "Fides et Gravitas." <span class="cmt_word">For them that feared the Lord.</span> For their benefit, to preserve their name forever. <span class="cmt_word">Thought upon his Name.</span> Prized his Name, regarded it with awe.

The yoke of Christ is easy. But those who work wickedness, tempt God by presumptuous sins. Judge of things as they will appear when the doom of these proud sinners comes to be executed. Those that feared the Lord, spake kindly, for preserving and promoting mutual love, when sin thus abounded. They spake one to another, in the language of those that fear the Lord, and think on his name. As evil communications corrupt good minds and manners, so good communications confirm them. A book of remembrance was written before God. He will take care that his children perish not with those that believe not. They shall be vessels of mercy and honour, when the rest are made vessels of wrath and dishonour. The saints are God's jewels; they are dear to him. He will preserve them as his jewels, when the earth is burned up like dross. Those who now own God for theirs, he will then own for his. It is our duty to serve God with the disposition of children; and he will not have his children trained up in idleness; they must do him service from a principle of love. Even God's children stand in need of sparing mercy. All are righteous or wicked, such as serve God, or such as serve him not: all are going to heaven or to hell. We are often deceived in our opinions concerning both the one and the other; but at the bar of Christ, every man's character will be known. As to ourselves, we have need to think among which we shall have our lot; and, as to others, we must judge nothing before the time. But in the end all the world will confess that those alone were wise and happy, who served the Lord and trusted in Him.</body></html>
