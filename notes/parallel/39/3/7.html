Return: unto me, and I will return unto you (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a>, where see note). Man must cooperate with God's preventing grace, and then God gives him further grace unto repentance and amendment. Here, if the people followed the preaching of the prophets and obeyed the promptings of the Holy Spirit, God promises to bless and save them. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein shall we return?</span> Here is the Pharisaical spirit, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>, etc. They do not acknowledge their offence; they consider that they are righteous and need no repentance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 The men of that generation turned away from God, they had not kept his ordinances. God gives them a gracious call. But they said, Wherein shall we return? God notices what returns our hearts make to the calls of his word. It shows great perverseness in sin, when men make afflictions excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them and their sins. Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must be served in the first place; and the interest of our souls ought to be preferred before that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide for their comfort. God has blessings ready for us, but through the weakness of our faith and the narrowness of our desires, we have not room to receive them. He who makes trial will find nothing is lost by honouring the Lord with his substance.</body></html>
