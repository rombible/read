The tithes were brought to the temple, and laid up in the chambers built to receive them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5, 12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That there may be meat in mine house.</span> That they who minister about holy things may live of the things of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Prove me now herewith</span>.

God gives them a gracious call. But they said, Wherein shall we return? God notices what returns our hearts make to the calls of his word. It shows great perverseness in sin, when men make afflictions excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them and their sins. Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must be served in the first place; and the interest of our souls ought to be preferred before that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide for their comfort. God has blessings ready for us, but through the weakness of our faith and the narrowness of our desires, we have not room to receive them. He who makes trial will find nothing is lost by honouring the Lord with his substance.</body></html>
