(Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm" title="For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">My messenger.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Malachi, my angel,</span> or <span class= "ital">my messenger,</span> with a play on the name of the prophet. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a>, he calls the priest the <span class= "ital">angel</span> or <span class= "ital">messenger</span> of the LORD. There can be little doubt that he is influenced in his choice of the term by his own personal name (see <span class= "ital">Introd.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> This "messenger," by the distinct reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm" title="The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.">Isaiah 40:3</a>, contained in the words, "and he shall prepare," &c., is evidently the same as he whom [the deutero-] Isaiah prophetically heard crying, "In the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God." Moreover, from the nature of his mission, he is proved to be identical with the "Elijah" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-3.htm" title="And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 4:3</a>. These words had their first, if not their perfect fulfilment in John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-12.htm" title="But I say to you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.">Matthew 17:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The Lord.</span>--This word "Lord" occurs eight times with the definite article, but always, except here, with the name of God following it: viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-17.htm" title="Three items in the year all your males shall appear before the LORD God.">Exodus 23:17</a>, followed by "Jehovah;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-23.htm" title="Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.">Exodus 34:23</a>, by "Jehovah, the God of Israel;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm" title="Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, does take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-33.htm" title="Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.">Isaiah 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-4.htm" title="And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, said the Lord, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 19:4</a>, by "Jehovah Zebaoth;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm" title="Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.">Isaiah 10:16</a>, by "the Lord of Zebaoth." And here, as elsewhere, it must mean God Himself, because He is said to come "to <span class= "ital">his</span> temple," and because He is said to be He "whom ye seek:" <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "the God of judgment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm" title="You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, Wherein have we wearied him? When you say, Every one that does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?">Malachi 2:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "namely," for so the Hebrew conjunction "and" is frequently used: <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-12.htm" title="And you shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.">Exodus 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm" title="Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.">1Samuel 28:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The messenger</span> (or angel)<span class= "bld"> of the covenant.</span>--This expression occurs only in this passage. Identified as He is here with "the Lord," He can be no other than the Son of God, who was manifested in the flesh as the Messiah. In the word "covenant" there is, perhaps, some reference to the "new covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>), but the meaning of the word must not be limited to this.<p><span class= "bld">Delight in.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">desire.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will send</span> (<span class="accented">I send</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my messenger.</span> God answers that he is coming to show himself the God of judgment and justice. Are they ready to meet him and to bear his sentence? Who this "messenger" is is disputed. That no angel or heavenly visitant is meant is clear from historical considerations, as no such event took place immediately before the Lord came to his temple. Nor can Malachi himself be intended, as his message was delivered nearly four, hundred years before Messiah came. The announcement is doubtless founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, and refers to the same person as the older prophet mentions, who is generally allowed to be John the Baptist, the herald of Christ's advent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-10.htm">Matthew 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Prepare the way before me.</span> The expression is borrowed from Isaiah, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). He prepares the way by preaching repentance, and thus removing the obstacle of sin which stood between God and his people. <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye seek.</span> When ye ask, "Where is the God of judgment?" <span class="cmt_word">Shall suddenly come to his temple.</span> The Lord (<span class="accented">ha-Adon</span>) is Jehovah, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, etc. There is a change of persons here, as frequently. Jehovah shall unexpectedly come to his temple (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) <span class="accented">as</span> King and God of Israel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>). There was a literal fulfilment of this prophecy when Christ was presented in the temple as an infant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Even the messenger of the covenant.</span> He is identified with the Lord; and he is the covenant angel who guided the Israelites to the promised land, and who is seen in the various theophanies of the Old Testament. The Divinity of Messiah is thus unequivocally asserted. In him are fulfilled all the promises made under the old covenant, and he is called (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>) "the Mediator of the new covenant." Some render," and the Messenger," etc., thus distinguishing the Angel of the covenant from the forerunner who prepares the way. But this is already done by the expressions, "My Messenger," and "the Lord." <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye delight in.</span> Whose advent ye expect with eager desire. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The first words of this chapter seem an answer to the scoffers of those days. Here is a prophecy of the appearing of John the Baptist. He is Christ's harbinger. He shall prepare the way before him, by calling men to repentance. The Messiah had been long called, He that should come, and now shortly he will come. He is the Messenger of the covenant. Those who seek Jesus, shall find pleasure in him, often when not looked for. The Lord Jesus, prepares the sinner's heart to be his temple, by the ministry of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, and he enters it as the Messenger of peace and consolation. No hypocrite or formalist can endure his doctrine, or stand before his tribunal. Christ came to distinguish men, to separate between the precious and the vile. He shall sit as a Refiner. Christ, by his gospel, shall purify and reform his church, and by his Spirit working with it, shall regenerate and cleanse souls. He will take away the dross found in them. He will separate their corruptions, which render their faculties worthless and useless. The believer needs not fear the fiery trial of afflictions and temptations, by which the Saviour refines his gold. He will take care it is not more intense or longer than is needful for his good; and this trial will end far otherwise than that of the wicked. Christ will, by interceding for them, make them accepted. Where no fear of God is, no good is to be expected. Evil pursues sinners. God is unchangeable. And though the sentence against evil works be not executed speedily, yet it will be executed; the Lord is as much an enemy to sin as ever. We may all apply this to ourselves. Because we have to do with a God that changes not, therefore it is that we are not consumed; because his compassions fail not.</body></html>
