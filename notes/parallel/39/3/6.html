But the last verb does not mean "to alter;" and, moreover, the former translation is exactly in accordance with the wording of the prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/9-14.htm" title="Should we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? would not you be angry with us till you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?">Ezra 9:14-15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I am the Lord, I change not;</span> or, <span class="accented">Jehovah, I change not</span>. This is to show that God performs his promises, and effectually disposes of the allegation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>, that he put no difference between the evil and the good. The great principles of right and wrong never alter; they are as everlasting as he who gave them. God here speaks of himself by his covenant name, which expresses his eternal independent being, "the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</span> Because God's eternal purpose stands good, and his "gifts and calling are without repentance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>), therefore the Israelites are indeed chastised and corrected, but not wholly consumed; they have a place and a nation, and the great promises made to their foregathers will all be fulfilled in due time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-20.htm">Micah 7:20</a>). He calls them "sons of Jacob," to remind them of the covenant made with their great ancestor, which was the portion of all true Israelites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20, 21</a>). Orelli would read, "Ye have not made an end," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of your sins; so virtually the Septuagint, which joins this clause to the following verse. But the present text is most probably correct. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The first words of this chapter seem an answer to the scoffers of those days. Here is a prophecy of the appearing of John the Baptist. He is Christ's harbinger. He shall prepare the way before him, by calling men to repentance. The Messiah had been long called, He that should come, and now shortly he will come. He is the Messenger of the covenant. Those who seek Jesus, shall find pleasure in him, often when not looked for. The Lord Jesus, prepares the sinner's heart to be his temple, by the ministry of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, and he enters it as the Messenger of peace and consolation. No hypocrite or formalist can endure his doctrine, or stand before his tribunal. Christ came to distinguish men, to separate between the precious and the vile. He shall sit as a Refiner. Christ, by his gospel, shall purify and reform his church, and by his Spirit working with it, shall regenerate and cleanse souls. He will take away the dross found in them. He will separate their corruptions, which render their faculties worthless and useless. The believer needs not fear the fiery trial of afflictions and temptations, by which the Saviour refines his gold. He will take care it is not more intense or longer than is needful for his good; and this trial will end far otherwise than that of the wicked. Christ will, by interceding for them, make them accepted. Where no fear of God is, no good is to be expected. Evil pursues sinners. God is unchangeable. And though the sentence against evil works be not executed speedily, yet it will be executed; the Lord is as much an enemy to sin as ever. We may all apply this to ourselves. Because we have to do with a God that changes not, therefore it is that we are not consumed; because his compassions fail not.</body></html>
