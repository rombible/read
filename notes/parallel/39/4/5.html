When John the Baptist answered the question of the deputies of the Sanhedrim, "Art thou Elias?" by "I am not," he simply gave a negative reply to their question, which was formulated on their misapprehension. On the other hand, that John the Baptist is the "messenger" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a> and the "Elijah" of this verse is shown conclusively (as far as Christians are concerned) by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-16.htm" title="And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.">Luke 1:16-17</a> before his birth, by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1-12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/1-2.htm" title="As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.">Mark 1:2-8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2-18</a>, at the commencement of his ministry. Moreover, our Lord Himself assured the people that John was this "messenger" and "Elijah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-10.htm" title="For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.">Matthew 11:10</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-27.htm" title="This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.">Luke 7:27</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and His disciples that he had appeared, and not been recognised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-1.htm" title="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.">Mark 9:1</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Finally, it is a significant fact that these two greatest of Old Testament prophets, Moses and Elias, who are mentioned together in this last prophetic exhortation, are the two who appeared with Christ on the Mount of Transfiguration, when all that which is contained in the Law and the prophets was about to be fulfilled.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elijah the prophet.</span> This is not the same personage as the "messenger" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>; for the latter comes before the first advent of the Lord, the former appears before the day of judgment; one comes to prepare the way of the Lord, and is followed immediately by Messiah's coming to his temple; the other is sent to convert the chosen people, lest the land be smitten with a curse. There seems to be no valid reason for not holding the literal sense of the words, and seeing in them a promise that Elijah the prophet, who was taken alive from the earth, shall at the last day coma again to carry out God's wise purposes. That this was the view adopted by the Jews in all ages we see by the version of the LXX., who have here, "Elijah the Tishbite;" by the allusion in Ecclus. 48:10; and by the question of our Lard's disciples in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-10.htm">Matthew 17:10</a>, "Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come." Christ himself confirms this opinion by answering, "Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things." lie cannot be referring here to John the Baptist, because he uses the future tense; and when he goes on to say that "Elias is come already," he is referring to what was past, and he himself explains that he means John, who was announced to come in the spirit and power of Elias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>), but of whom it could not be said that he "restored all things." The same opinion is found in the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3, 6</a>), where one of the witnesses is very commonly supposed to be Elijah. It is argued by Keil, Reinke, and others, that, as the promise of King David in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, etc., cannot imply the resurrection of David and his return to earth, so we cannot think of an actual reappearance of Elijah himself, but only of the coming of some prophet with his spirit and power. But, as Knabenbauer points out, for the attribution of the name David to Messiah, long and careful preparation had been made; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> by his being called "the rod of Jesse," the occupant of David's throne, etc.; and all who heard the expression would at once understand the symbolical application, especially as David was known to have died and been buried. But when they found Malachi speaking of the reappearance of "Elijah <span class="accented">the prophet</span>," who, as they were well aware, had never died, of whose connection with the coming Messenger they had never heard, they could not avoid the conclusion to which they came, viz. that before the great day of judgment Elias should again visit the earth in person. This prophecy concerns the very last days, and intimates that before the final consummation, when iniquity shall abound, God will send this great and faithful preacher of repentance, whose mission shall have such effects that the purpose of God for the salvation of Israel shall be accomplished. We may therefore assume that in the gospel the appellation "Elias" stands both for John and for Elijah himself; for the messenger who prepared the way for Christ's first advent, and for the prophet who was to convert the Israelites before the judgment day; for him who came in spirit and power, and him who shall come in bodily presence. <span class="cmt_word">The great and dreadful day.</span> The day of final judgment. No other crisis could be named in such terms (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, whence the words are taken). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-6 Here is a solemn conclusion, not only of this prophecy, but of the Old Testament. Conscience bids us remember the law. Though we have not prophets, yet, as long as we have Bibles, we may keep up our communion with God. Let others boast in their proud reasoning, and call it enlightening, but let us keep near to that sacred word, through which this Sun of Righteousness shines upon the souls of his people. They must keep up a believing expectation of the gospel of Christ, and must look for the beginning of it. John the Baptist preached repentance and reformation, as Elijah had done. The turning of souls to God and their duty, is the best preparation of them for the great and dreadful day of the Lord. John shall preach a doctrine that shall reach men's hearts, and work a change in them. Thus he shall prepare the way for the kingdom of heaven. The Jewish nation, by wickedness, laid themselves open to the curse. God was ready to bring ruin upon them; but he will once more try whether they will repent and return; therefore he sent John the Baptist to preach repentance to them. Let the believer wait with patience for his release, and cheerfully expect the great day, when Christ shall come the second time to complete our salvation. But those must expect to be smitten with a sword, with a curse, who turn not to Him that smites them with a rod. None can expect to escape the curse of God's broken law, nor to enjoy the happiness of his chosen and redeemed people, unless their hearts are turned from sin and the world, to Christ and holiness. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with us all. Amen.</body></html>
