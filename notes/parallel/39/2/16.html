This passage coincides more nearly with the spirit of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3</a> <span class= "ital">seqq.</span> than with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>. <span class= "ital">To yourselves,</span> or <span class= "ital">to your spirit.</span> The expressions are equivalent. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-15.htm" title="Take you therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire:">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm" title="Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love the LORD your God.">Joshua 23:11</a>.) <span class= "ital">Let none be</span> . . .--Observe the change of person, so common in Hebrew. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm" title="For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.">Isaiah 1:29</a>.) <span class= "ital">His garment.</span>--Some take this to be an Oriental expression for "his wife." (Comp. Al Koran, 2:--"Wives are your attire, and you are theirs.") Or <span class= "ital">garment</span> may be taken as the external symbol of the inner state of the man. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-4.htm" title="And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with change of raiment.">Zechariah 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-5.htm" title="You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness, those that remember you in your ways: behold, you are wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.">Isaiah 64:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm" title="Lest I be full, and deny you, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.">Proverbs 30:9</a>, &c.) <span class= "ital">Injury.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">chamas.</span> This word is especially used of ill-treatment of a wife. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-5.htm" title="And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong be on you: I have given my maid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and you.">Genesis 16:5</a>.) Keil takes the first verse as follows: <span class= "ital">No man who had ever a remnant of reason</span> [or a sense of right and wrong] <span class= "ital">has done</span> [<span class= "ital">sc.,</span> what ye are doing, <span class= "ital">viz.,</span> faithlessly putting away the wife of his youth. To this the people are supposed to object.] <span class= "ital">But what did the one</span> [Abraham] <span class= "ital">do?</span> [To this the prophet answers] <span class= "ital">He was seeking a seed of God</span> [viz., the child of promise: <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> he dismissed Hagar, because God promised to give him the desired posterity, not in Ishmael through the maid Hagar, but through Sarah in Isaac, so that in doing this he was simply acting in obedience to the word of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-12.htm" title="And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the lad, and because of your female slave; in all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac shall your seed be called.">Genesis 21:12</a>).] Others vary the translation slightly, and render, <span class= "ital">And has no one done this who has a remnant of spirit in him</span>? [This being supposed to be the objection on the part of the people. To this the prophet answers.] <span class= "ital">Wherefore did he so act? He was seeking a godly seed.</span> Moore takes the verse quite differently, and refers it to the saying of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm" title="Have we not all one father? has not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?">Malachi 2:10</a>. His words are, "The prophet at the outset had argued the return of the Jewish people . . . therefore these marriages that violated their oneness were wrong . . . He asks again . . . <span class= "ital">Did not</span> [God] <span class= "ital">make</span> [us] <span class= "ital">one</span>? Did He not separate us from other nations into an isolated unity? Yet this was not done because the blessing was too narrow to be spread over other nations . . . <span class= "ital">for the residue of the spirit was with Him.</span> There remained an inexhaustible fulness of spiritual blessing that might be given to other nations. <span class= "ital">Why</span> [then did He choose] <span class= "ital">but one? He was seeking a seed of God</span> [a nation which He should train up to be the repository of His covenant, the stock of His Messiah]." Many other interpretations have been proposed, but these are the only ones which are at all admissible.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hateth putting away.</span> This is another reason against divorce: God hates it. It is contrary to his original institution, and was only allowed for the hardness of men's hearts (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3-9</a>). Septuagint, "If thou hate her and dismiss her," etc.; Vulgate, "If thou hate her, put her away," which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned. Hence Jerome considers these words to be spoken by the Jews, quoting in their defence Moses' precept. Others think that they are ironical - Put her away, if you please; but you must bear the consequences. <span class="cmt_word">For one covereth violence with his garment.</span> He who thus divorces his wife shows himself openly to all beholders as an iniquitous man. So the clause is better rendered, <span class="accented">And one</span> (<span class="accented">who does so</span>) <span class="accented">covereth his garment with violence</span>, or, <span class="accented">violence</span> <span class="accented">covereth his garment.</span> Iniquity attaches itself to him plainly, encircling and enfolding him; the clothing of iniquity is the mark of the foul soul within. The notion of "garment" being here used figuratively for wife (as Hitzig supposes) is without proof. Such a metaphor is certainly unknown to Hebrew literature, though there is something like it in Arabic, "Wives are your attire, and ye are theirs" (Koran). Bishop Wordsworth considers that the phrase in the text refers to the custom of the bridegroom in espousals casting the skirt of his garment over her who was betrothed to him (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>). So the idea would be, "Ye cast your skirt over iniquity, and betroth violence to yourselves for a bride." But this seems somewhat forced. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed... treacherously.</span> A repetition of the warning in ver. 15. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-17 Corrupt practices are the fruit of corrupt principles; and he who is false to his God, will not be true to his fellow mortals. In contempt of the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away the wives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strange wives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight of others, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife; thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to be looked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. There is an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Man and wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace. Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have made another Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It was that the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wives must live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would be kept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sin begins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their families springs from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness of others, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisome to God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those who think God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves. The scoffers said, Where is the God of judgement? but the day of the Lord will come.</body></html>
