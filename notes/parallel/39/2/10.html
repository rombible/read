He introduces this rebuke by a general statement, similar to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm" title="I have loved you, said the LORD. Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? said the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,">Malachi 1:2</a>.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">One father</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> not Adam, Abraham, or Jacob (as various commentators have held), but God Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm" title="A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And you say, Wherein have we despised your name?">Malachi 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm" title="Do you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm" title="Of the Rock that begat you you are unmindful, and have forgotten God that formed you.">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>), who is the spiritual Father of the nation, and in whom they are all brothers and sisters; so that when an Israelite married a heathen woman, or divorced an Israelitish wife, it was an offence against God, a "profaning the covenant of the fathers," and a violation of the fraternal relation. Moreover, "one God created" them for His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-7.htm" title="Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yes, I have made him.">Isaiah 43:7</a>), for the special purpose of being a witness to His unity. The admission of idolatresses into their families would be fatal to this object.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-16</span> - Part II. CONDEMNATION OF PRIESTS AND PEOPLE FOR ALIEN MARRIAGES AND FOR DIVORCES. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have we not all one Father?</span> In proceeding to his new subject, the violations of the law of marriage, the prophet pursues his habitual method. He starts with a general principle, here assuming an interrogative form, and on it builds his rebuke. The priests were guilty, if not of profane marriages, at any rate of sinful neglect in not warning the people against them. Many take the "one father" to be Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>), and it is no objection to this view that he was also the progenitor of Ishmaelites, Edomites, etc., because there was at this time no question about marriage with these nations, but with Canaanites, Moabites, Egyptians, and so on. But the parallelism with the following clause shows that by the Father is meant Almighty God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath not one God created us?</span> Hath not God taken us as his peculiar people, so as to call us his sons and his firstborn (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>)? Of course, God created all men; but the Jews alone recognized him as Creator. The prophet's proposition is that all Israelites were spiritual brothers and sisters, equally loved and chosen by God. From this he argues that in sinning against one another, they offended their common Father, and broke the family compact. <span class="cmt_word">Deal treacherously.</span> Act faithlessly against one another. He does not yet say in what this treachery consists, but adds, <span class="cmt_word">by profaning the covenant of our fathers</span>. He unites himself with them, because he suffered in their sin. They violated the covenant by which God chose them to be his peculiar people and placed himself in mysterious relation to them, on condition that they should keep themselves aloof from the evil nations around them, and avoid all connection with them and their practices. By intermarriages with the heathen, they profaned this covenant. This evil was one which Ezra had done his best to eradicate, using most stringent measures for its suppression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9.htm">Ezra 9, 10</a>.); Nehemiah, too, contended against those who had contracted these marriages, when he found on his return to Jerusalem many such transgressors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23-28</a>); and now the prophet lifts up his voice in the cause of purity and obedience. The warning against throe mixed unions is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a>, 18. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-17 Corrupt practices are the fruit of corrupt principles; and he who is false to his God, will not be true to his fellow mortals. In contempt of the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away the wives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strange wives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight of others, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife; thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to be looked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. There is an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Man and wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace. Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have made another Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It was that the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wives must live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would be kept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sin begins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their families springs from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness of others, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisome to God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those who think God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves. The scoffers said, Where is the God of judgement? but the day of the Lord will come.</body></html>
