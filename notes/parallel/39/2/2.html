Others refer the words to the blessing which the priests pronounce on the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/6-23.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,">Numbers 6:23-27</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will even send a curse;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">then will I send the curse.</span> St. Jerome, regarding the temporal effect of the curse, translates, <span class="accented">egestatem</span> "scarcity" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I will curse your blessings</span>. The blessings which as priests they had to pronounce upon the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23-27</a>). These God would not ratify, but would turn them into curses, and thus punish the people who connived at and imitated the iniquities of the priests. Or the expression may refer to the material benefits promised by God to the Israelites on their obedience. But as the announcement is made specially to the priests, this explanation seems less probable. <span class="cmt_word">I have cursed them already.</span> The curse has already begun to work. Dr. S. Cox ('Bible Educator,' 3:67, etc.) points out here an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1, 2</a>, wherein it is recorded that they reed from the Book of Moses how that the Moabites "hired Balsam against them that he should curse them; howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing." Malachi, who, as he thinks, was present on this occasion, may have been deeply impressed by these words; and it is probable that we hear an echo of them in the threat of ver. 2. "That of old God had turned a curse into a blessing, may have suggested the menace that he would now turn a blessing into a curse." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 What is here said of the covenant of priesthood, is true of the covenant of grace made with all believers, as spiritual priests. It is a covenant of life and peace; it assures all believers of all happiness, both in this world and in that to come. It is an honour to God's servants to be employed as his messengers. The priest's lips should not keep knowledge from his people, but keep it for them. The people are all concerned to know the will of the Lord. We must not only consult the written word, but desire instruction and advice from God's messengers, in the affairs of our souls. Ministers must exert themselves to the utmost for the conversion of sinners; and even among those called Israelites, there are many to be turned from iniquity. Those ministers, and those only, are likely to turn men from sin, who preach sound doctrine, and live holy lives according to the Scripture. Many departed from this way; thus they misled the people. Such as walk with God in peace and righteousness, and turn others from sin, honour God; he will honour them, while those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.</body></html>
