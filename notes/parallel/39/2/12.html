This is the interpretation of Gesenius, who quotes in support of it an Arabic expression from the life of Tim�r-lang (Timur the lame, <span class= "ital">Tamerlane</span>):--"When he left the city, there was not a <span class= "ital">crier or an answerer</span> in it"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> there was not a person left alive.

But since the highest privilege of the Jew was to bring offerings to the Sanctuary, the words may be merely a repetition of the former expression in different terms, and mean "a descendant enjoying religious privileges." The intermarriage with heathens referred to here is that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:">Nehemiah 13:23-28</a>, not the earlier case recorded in Ezra 9, 10.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will cut off.</span> The Hebrew is an imprecation, "May the Lord cut off" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2, 3</a>). It implies that the transgressor shall be deprived of his position as one of the covenant people, and shall leave no one to maintain his name and family. <span class="cmt_word">The man.</span> Others render, "unto the man," making the following words the direct object of the verb. <span class="cmt_word">The master and the scholar;</span> so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">magistrum et discipulum</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the watcher and the answerer, i.e.</span> the watchman and the inhabitants of the city; the LXX., reading somewhat differently, has, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3b2;</span>, "until he be brought low from the tents of Jacob," meaning, until he repent and return humbly to obedience. In this case the term "cut off" must be taken in some milder sense than "exterminate." The present text, however, seems to be a kind of alliterative proverbial saying to express totality, everybody; though whence it arose, and what is its exact signification, are matters of great uncertainty. Some take the phrase to mean," every waking and speaking person," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every living soul. The English and Latin Versions proceed on the assumption (which Pusey denies) that the first verb can be taken actively, "he that awakeneth," the teacher being so called as stimulating the scholar, who is named "the answerer." The Targum and Syriac explain it by "son and son's son." Of the various suggestions offered, the most probable is that it is a military phrase derived from the challenge of the sentinels and the answer thereto, which in time came to de. note the whole inhabitants of a camp or city. <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacles</span>. The dwellings. Or the word, as Dr. Cox supposes, may belong to the original saying, and have come down from the remote period when the Israelites lived in tents. <span class="cmt_word">And him that offereth an offering</span> (<span class="accented">michchah</span>) <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord of hosts.</span> The same punishment shall fall on one who offers even an oblation of meal for men who are guilty of this sin. This sin would appertain specially to the priests. Or we may take the clause in a general sense. God will cut off every such transgressor, even if he try to propitiate the Lord by making an offering before trim (Ecclus. 35. [32] 12), "Do not think to corrupt with gifts; for such he will not receive: and trust not to unrighteous sacrifices; for the Lord is Judge, and with him is no respect of persons." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-17 Corrupt practices are the fruit of corrupt principles; and he who is false to his God, will not be true to his fellow mortals. In contempt of the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away the wives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strange wives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight of others, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife; thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to be looked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. There is an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Man and wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace. Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have made another Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It was that the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wives must live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would be kept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sin begins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their families springs from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness of others, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisome to God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those who think God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves. The scoffers said, Where is the God of judgement? but the day of the Lord will come.</body></html>
