According to this view, the words should be translated, <span class= "ital">My covenant was with him--</span>viz., <span class= "ital">life and peace</span>--<span class= "ital">and I gave them to him; fear, and he feared me, and trembled before My Name.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">In contrast with these evil ministers, the character of the true priest is sketched, and thus the faults of the former are shown in darker colours.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My covenant was with him of life and peace;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with him was life and peace.</span> This is one side of the covenant, that which God gave - the blessing of life, abundance, prosperity, and secure and undisturbed enjoyment of these, in the everlasting priesthood, in agreement with the promise to Phinehas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-12.htm">Numbers 25:12</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I gave them to him for the fear</span>, etc. I gave him life and peace. The pronominal suffix "them" is not expressed in the Greek and Latin Versions, and is absent from many Hebrew manuscripts, which read, "I gave him fear." So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dedi eis timorem et timuit me</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, "I gave him the fear of me." This expresses man's part in the covenant: God gave him certain blessings on condition that he feared, reverenced, worshipped, and obeyed the Lord. The last part of the verse as now read is more simply explained, "and (my covenant with him was, or, I gave him) fear, and he did fear me." God's gifts were life and peace. Levi's part was fear of God: this he performed. The ideal priest observed all the duties of piety and reverence, and therefore in his case the covenant stood firm and was duly carried out. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 What is here said of the covenant of priesthood, is true of the covenant of grace made with all believers, as spiritual priests. It is a covenant of life and peace; it assures all believers of all happiness, both in this world and in that to come. It is an honour to God's servants to be employed as his messengers. The priest's lips should not keep knowledge from his people, but keep it for them. The people are all concerned to know the will of the Lord. We must not only consult the written word, but desire instruction and advice from God's messengers, in the affairs of our souls. Ministers must exert themselves to the utmost for the conversion of sinners; and even among those called Israelites, there are many to be turned from iniquity. Those ministers, and those only, are likely to turn men from sin, who preach sound doctrine, and live holy lives according to the Scripture. Many departed from this way; thus they misled the people. Such as walk with God in peace and righteousness, and turn others from sin, honour God; he will honour them, while those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.</body></html>
