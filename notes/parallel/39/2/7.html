So Haggai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>) is called "the Lord's messenger," or angel. Some see here an allusion to Malachi's own name or office (see Introduction, &sect; II.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-9.htm">2 Chronicles 17:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 What is here said of the covenant of priesthood, is true of the covenant of grace made with all believers, as spiritual priests. It is a covenant of life and peace; it assures all believers of all happiness, both in this world and in that to come. It is an honour to God's servants to be employed as his messengers. The priest's lips should not keep knowledge from his people, but keep it for them. The people are all concerned to know the will of the Lord. We must not only consult the written word, but desire instruction and advice from God's messengers, in the affairs of our souls. Ministers must exert themselves to the utmost for the conversion of sinners; and even among those called Israelites, there are many to be turned from iniquity. Those ministers, and those only, are likely to turn men from sin, who preach sound doctrine, and live holy lives according to the Scripture. Many departed from this way; thus they misled the people. Such as walk with God in peace and righteousness, and turn others from sin, honour God; he will honour them, while those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.</body></html>
