Their marriages had been made before God; he who first instituted matrimony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>) was a witness of the contract and gave it his sanction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-50.htm">Genesis 31:50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The wife of thy youth.</span> Whom thou didst marry when thine affections were pure and fresh, and for whom thy love was strong and simple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Against whom thou hast dealt treacherously;</span> Septuagint, "whom thou hast deserted." This wife of thine thou hast betrayed, breaking faith with her by repudiating her. The wife of thy covenant. With whom thou didst make a solemn vow and covenant, to violate which is a monstrous crime. We have very little information respecting the religious ceremonies connected with a Jewish wedding. The previous espousal was a formal proceeding, conducted by friends and parents, and confirmed by oaths. The actual marriage seems to have been accompanied by certain solemn promises and blessings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-60.htm">Genesis 24:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11, 12</a>; Tobit 7:13; Smith, 'Dict. of Bible'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-17 Corrupt practices are the fruit of corrupt principles; and he who is false to his God, will not be true to his fellow mortals. In contempt of the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away the wives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strange wives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight of others, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife; thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to be looked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. There is an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Man and wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace. Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have made another Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It was that the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wives must live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would be kept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sin begins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their families springs from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness of others, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisome to God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those who think God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves. The scoffers said, Where is the God of judgement? but the day of the Lord will come.</body></html>
