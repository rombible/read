The words "by us" are determined by the context as referring to the preacher rather than to the hearers of the Word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For all the promises of God in him are yea;</span> rather, <span class="accented">For so many as be the promises of God, in him is the yea</span>. All the promises of God find in him their unchangeable fulfilment. He was "a minister to confirm the promises" alike to the Jews and the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>); and "the premise of the eternal inheritance" can only be fulfilled in him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And in him Amen.</span> The true reading is," Wherefore by him also is the Amen to God, uttered by us to his glory" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, F, G, etc.). In Christ is the "yea" of immutable promise and absolute fulfilment; the Church utters the "Amen" of perfect faith and grateful adoration. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>, we have a proof of the ancientness of the custom by which the congregation utters the "Amen" at the end of praise and prayer. But as the "yea" is in Christ, so it is only through him that we can receive the grace to utter aright the "Amen" to the glory of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
