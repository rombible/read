They had done him some, though not adequate, justice. The phrase "in part" may be noted as specially characteristic of the Epistles of this period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm" title="Nevertheless, brothers, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,">Romans 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm" title="Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.">Romans 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1Corinthians 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.htm" title="Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.">1Corinthians 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-9.htm" title="For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.">1Corinthians 13:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That we</span> <span class= "bld">are your rejoicing . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a ground of exultation to you, as you are to us.</span> The words must be connected with the future rather than the past. "I trust that you will one day recognise that you have as much reason to be proud of me as I have to be proud of you." The word for "rejoicing," "boasting," "glorying," &c., is specially characteristic of this period of St. Paul's life, occurring forty-six times in 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans, and only six times in his other Epistles. The "day of the Lord Jesus," of His great advent to judge the world (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>), defines the "end" to which the previous verse had pointed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In part.</span> Not as a whole Church.

In ver. 12 the substantive means "the <span class="accented">act</span> of rejoicing." The word is characteristic of this group of Epistles, in which it occurs forty-six times, <span class="cmt_word">Even as ye also are ours.</span> This clause takes away all semblance of self-glorification. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a> he expresses the natural thought that a teacher's converts are, and will be in the last day, his "crown of exultation." Here alone he implies that they may glory in him as he in them. The thought, however, so far frond being egotistical, merely indicates the in. tense intercommunion of sympathy which existed between him and them. He does but place himself on a level with his converts, and imply that they mutually gloried in each other. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the Lord Jesus</span> (see on 1 Corinthians 3:13). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-14 Though, as a sinner, the apostle could only rejoice and glory in Christ Jesus, yet, as a believer, he might rejoice and glory in being really what he professed. Conscience witnesses concerning the steady course and tenor of the life. Thereby we may judge ourselves, and not by this or by that single act. Our conversation will be well ordered, when we live and act under such a gracious principle in the heart. Having this, we may leave our characters in the Lord's hands, but using proper means to clear them, when the credit of the gospel, or our usefulness, calls for it.</body></html>
