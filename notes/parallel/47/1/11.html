It has been suggested that that may be its meaning <span class= "ital">even</span> here: <span class= "ital">that thanksgiving may be offered from many upturned faces.</span> The use of the word <span class= "ital">prosopop?ia,</span> however, for "personifying," and of <span class= "ital">prosopon</span> for the characters in a drama, indicates that the noun was beginning to be used in a different sense, and this must clearly have been well established when it came to be used in theological language for the three "persons" of the Godhead. It is interesting to note, however, as a fact in the history of language, that, if this be its meaning here, it is probably one of the earliest extant instances of its being so used.<p>The "gift," in this instance, is the deliverance from danger and suffering spoken of in the previous verse. Safety and health deserved the name not less truly than prophecy and the gift of tongues. He assumes, with the same subtle refinement as before, that they will be as ready to give thanks for his recovery or deliverance as they were to pray for it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye also helping together by prayer for us.</span> St. Paul had a deep conviction of the efficacy of intercessory prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-30.htm">Romans 15:30, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm">Philippians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the means of many persons;</span> literally, <span class="accented">from many faces</span>.

God, he implies, will be well pleased when he sees the gratitude beaming from the many countenances of those who thank him for his answer to their prayers on his behalf. The word for "<span class="accented">gift"</span> <span class="accented">is charisma</span>, which means a gift of grace, a gift of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 We are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. The Lord is able to give peace to the troubled conscience, and to calm the raging passions of the soul. These blessings are given by him, as the Father of his redeemed family. It is our Saviour who says, Let not your heart be troubled. All comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts are in him. He speaks peace to souls by granting the free remission of sins; and he comforts them by the enlivening influences of the Holy Spirit, and by the rich mercies of his grace. He is able to bind up the broken-hearted, to heal the most painful wounds, and also to give hope and joy under the heaviest sorrows. The favours God bestows on us, are not only to make us cheerful, but also that we may be useful to others. He sends comforts enough to support such as simply trust in and serve him. If we should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet we may then trust God, who can bring back even from death. Their hope and trust were not in vain; nor shall any be ashamed who trust in the Lord. Past experiences encourage faith and hope, and lay us under obligation to trust in God for time to come. And it is our duty, not only to help one another with prayer, but in praise and thanksgiving, and thereby to make suitable returns for benefits received. Thus both trials and mercies will end in good to ourselves and others.</body></html>
