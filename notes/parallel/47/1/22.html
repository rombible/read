(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>; and, for the Jewish use of seals, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-10.htm" title="And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.">Jeremiah 32:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And given the earnest of the Spirit.</span>--Better, for the same reason as before, <span class= "ital">gave.</span> The Greek word for "earnest" (<span class= "ital">arrhabon</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> which occurs here for the first time, and is used only by St. Paul in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="Now he that has worked us for the selfsame thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.">2Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>), has a somewhat interesting history. Originally a Hebrew word, from a verb meaning "to mix," "to change," "to pledge," and so used, as a cognate noun, with the last of the three senses, it appears simply transliterated in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/38-17.htm" title="And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?">Genesis 38:17-18</a>. It would seem to have been in common use among the Canaanite or Phoenician traders, and was carried by them to Greece, to Carthage, to Alexandria, and to Rome. It was used by the Greek orator Isaeus, and by Plautus and Terence among the earlier Latin writers. The full form came to be considered somehow as pedantic or vulgar, and was superseded in Roman law by the shortened "arrha," the payment of a small sum given on the completion of a bargain as a pledge that the payer would fulfil the contract; and it has passed into Italian as "arra;" into modern French, as "les arrhes;" into popular Scotch even, as "arles." As applied by St. Paul, it had the force of a condensed parable, such as the people of commercial cities like Corinth and Ephesus would readily understand. They were not to think that their past spiritual experience had any character of finality. It was rather but the pledge of yet greater gifts to come: even of that knowledge of God which is eternal life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>). The same thought is expressed, under a more Hebrew image, in the "<span class= "ital">firstfruits</span> of the Spirit" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>. Grammatically, the "earnest of the Spirit" may be taken as an example of the genitive of apposition, "the earnest which <span class= "ital">is</span> the Spirit."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath also sealed us</span>. We cannot be deconsecrated, disanointed. Still less can the confirming seal be broken. He continues to dwell on the conception of the unchangeableness of God and of the gospel into which he had been incidentally led by the charge of "lightness." <span class="cmt_word">The earnest of the Spirit.</span> The promises which we have received are not mere promises, they are already so far fulfilled to us and in us as to guarantee hereafter their plenary fruition. Just as in money bargains "earnest money," "money on account," is given, in pledge that the whole will be ultimately discharged, so we have "the earnest of the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>), "the firstfruits of the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>), which are to us "the earnest" or pledge money that we shall hereafter enter upon the purchased possession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). We now see the meaning of the "and." It involves a climax - the promise is much; the unction more; the seal a still further security (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>); but beyond all this we have already a part payment in the indwelling of the Present of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). The word <span class="accented">arrabon</span>, rendered "earnest," has an interesting history. It is very ancient, for it is found (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-17.htm">Genesis 38:17, 18</a>, and comes from a root meaning "to pledge." It seems to be a Phoenician word, which had been introduced into various languages by the universality of Phoenician commerce. In classical Latin it is shortened into <span class="accented">arrha</span>, and it still exists in Italian as <span class="accented">aura</span>, in French as <span class="accented">arrhes</span>. The equivalent Hebrew figure is "firstfruits" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
