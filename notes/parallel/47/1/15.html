It was because he trusted that they would judge him rightly that he had done that which had led some to judge him wrongly. His plan had been at first to go straight by sea from Ephesus to Corinth, then to pass on to Macedonia, thence to return to Corinth, and thence set sail for Jerusalem. When he wrote <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1Corinthians 16:5-6</a>, he had already modified his plan by deciding to go to Macedonia first. His original scheme had shown his wish to see as much of the Corinthians as possible. They were to have two visits ("a second <span class= "ital">favour"</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and not one only. Had he shown less regard, he asks, in the change with which he had been taunted?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-22.</span> <span class="accented">- His change of purpose in visiting Corinth</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this confidence.</span> In reliance on the mutual respect and affection which exists between us. <span class="cmt_word">I was minded.</span> The stress is partly on the tense: "my original desire <span class="accented">was</span>." When speaking of matters purely personal, St. Paul generally reverts to the first person. <span class="cmt_word">To come unto you before.</span> I meant to visit you, first on my way to Macedonia, and again on my return from Macedonia, as explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">A second benefit;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a second grace</span>. There is another reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>, joy, and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> itself sometimes has this sense (as in Tobit 7:18), but not in the New Testament. Here, again, there is no boastfulness. St. Paul, filled as he was with the power of the Holy Spirit, was able to impart to his converts some spiritual gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>), and this was the chief reason why his visits were so eagerly desired, and why his change of plan had caused such bitter disappointment to the Corinthians. The importance of the Church of Corinth, its central position, and its unsettled state made it desirable that he should give them as much as possible of his personal supervision. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
