He puts forward, therefore, the other side of his work. He was really seeking, not to domineer, or cause pain, but to be a fellow-worker with their "joy and peace in believing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm" title="Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:13</a>).

He had, indeed, authority (1 Colossians 4:21; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-6.htm">2 Corinthians 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-2.htm">2 Corinthians 13:2, 10</a>), but it was a purely spiritual authority; it was valid only over those who recognized in him an apostolic commission. St. Peter, no less than St. Paul, discourages the spirit of ecclesiastical <span class="accented">tyranny</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-3.htm">1 Peter 5:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But are helpers of your joy</span>.

As far as their "faith" was concerned, they were not to blame; <span class="accented">that</span> remained unshaken, and was independent of any visit or authority of St. Paul. But while "in respect of faith ye stand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>), there are other points in which you are being shaken, and in dealing with these I should have been obliged to take severe measures, which, if I postponed my visit, would (I hoped) become unnecessary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
