The word "stablisheth," or "confirmed," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="Who shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Corinthians 1:8</a>, is connected with the previous "Amen" as the emphatic formula of ratification. In the insertion of "with you" we note St. Paul's characteristic anxiety to avoid the appearance of claiming for himself what others might not claim with equal right. He repeats the confident hope which he had expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="Who shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Corinthians 1:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">In Christ.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">into Christ,</span> as though the result of the "establishing" was an actual incorporation with Him.

The verb follows naturally on the mention of Christ the Anointed One.

Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
