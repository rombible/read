The phrase by which he calls attention to the importance of what he is about to write is characteristic of the Epistles of this period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;">1Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1Thessalonians 4:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Our trouble which came to us in Asia.</span>--The allusion may possibly be to the Demetrius tumult of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-24.htm" title="For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;">Acts 19:24-41</a>, or to some like time of danger, such as that referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm" title="If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.">1Corinthians 15:32</a>. On the other hand, however, he would probably, in that case, have spoken of a definitely localised danger, as he does in the last reference as being "in Ephesus." The words "in Asia" suggest a wider range of suffering, such as we find referred to in the speech to the elders at Miletus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>), and the context leads us to think of bodily illness as well as of perils and anxieties.<p><span class= "bld">We were pressed out of measure.</span>--The adverbial phrase is specially characteristic of the Epistles of this period. We find it in the "exceedingly sinful" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm" title="Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.">Romans 7:13</a>; the "more excellent (or, <span class= "ital">transcending</span>) way" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1Corinthians 12:31</a>; and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;">2Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm" title="For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:">Galatians 1:13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Insomuch that we despaired even of life.</span>--The language is obviously more vividly descriptive of the collapse of illness than of any peril such as those referred to in the previous Note. St. Paul could hardly have despaired of life during the tumult of Acts 19.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant.</span> This is a favourite phrase with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>). Of our trouble; rather, <span class="accented">about our affliction</span>. He assumes that they are aware what the trouble was, and he does not specially mention it. What he wants them to know is that, by the help of their prayers and sympathy, God had delivered him out of this affliction, crushing as it was. <span class="cmt_word">Which came to us in Asia.</span> Most commentators refer this to the tumult at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>.); and since St. Paul's dangers, sicknesses, and troubles are clearly <span class="accented">understated</span> throughout the Acts, it is possible that the perils and personal maltreatment which were liable to occur during such a season of excitement may have brought on some violent illness; or, again, be may have suffered from some plots (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>, 32; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>) or shipwreck (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-4.htm">Romans 16:4</a> he alludes again to some extreme peril. But St. Paul seems systematically to have made light of external dangers and sufferings. All his strongest expressions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1-3</a>, etc.) are reserved for mental anguish and affliction. What he felt most keenly was the pang of lacerated affections. It is, therefore, possible that he is here alluding to the overpowering tumult of feelings which had been aroused by his anxiety as to the reception likely to be accorded to his first letter. To this and the accompanying circumstances he alludes again and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>, etc.). The sense of "comfort" resulting from the tidings brought by Titus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6, 7, 13</a>) is as strong as that expressed in these verses, and the allusion to this anguish of heart is specially appropriate here, because he is dwelling on the sympathetic communion between himself and his converts, both in their sorrows and their consolations. <span class="cmt_word">That we were pressed cut of measure, above strength;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that toe were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power</span>. The trial seemed too heavy for him to bear. The phrase here rendered "out of measure" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>; but is only found in this particular group of letters. <span class="cmt_word">Insomuch that we despaired even of life.</span> This rendering conveys the meaning. Literally it is, <span class="accented">so that we were even in utter perplexity</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>) <span class="accented">even about life</span>. "I fell into such agony of mind that I hardly hoped to survive." Generally, although he was often in perplexity, he succeeded in resisting despair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 We are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. The Lord is able to give peace to the troubled conscience, and to calm the raging passions of the soul. These blessings are given by him, as the Father of his redeemed family. It is our Saviour who says, Let not your heart be troubled. All comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts are in him. He speaks peace to souls by granting the free remission of sins; and he comforts them by the enlivening influences of the Holy Spirit, and by the rich mercies of his grace. He is able to bind up the broken-hearted, to heal the most painful wounds, and also to give hope and joy under the heaviest sorrows. The favours God bestows on us, are not only to make us cheerful, but also that we may be useful to others. He sends comforts enough to support such as simply trust in and serve him. If we should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet we may then trust God, who can bring back even from death. Their hope and trust were not in vain; nor shall any be ashamed who trust in the Lord. Past experiences encourage faith and hope, and lay us under obligation to trust in God for time to come. And it is our duty, not only to help one another with prayer, but in praise and thanksgiving, and thereby to make suitable returns for benefits received. Thus both trials and mercies will end in good to ourselves and others.</body></html>
