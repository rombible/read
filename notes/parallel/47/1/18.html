(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.">2Thessalonians 3:3</a>.) In other instances it is followed commonly by a statement as to some act or attribute of God. Here it is more of the nature of an oath: "As God is faithful in all His words, so my speech" (the vague term is used to include preaching, writing, personal intercourse) "is true and faithful also." There had been no "Yes" and "No" in the same breath; no saying one thing when he meant another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as God is true;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but God is faithful</span>, whatever man may be (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Our word towards you,</span> etc. The verse should be rendered, <span class="accented">But God is faithful, because</span> (faithful herein, that) <span class="accented">our preaching to you proved itself to be not yea and may</span>. Whatever you may say of my plans and my conduct, there was <span class="accented">one</span> thing which involved an indubitable "yea," namely, my preaching to you. In that, at any rate, there was nothing capricious, nothing variable, nothing vacillating. St. Paul, in a manner characteristic to his moods of deepest emotion, "goes off at a word." The Corinthians talked of his "yea" and "nay" as though one was little better than the other, and neither could be depended on; well, at any rate, <span class="accented">one thing</span>, and that the most essential, was as sure as the faithfulness of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
