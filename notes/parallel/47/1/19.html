The three names are joined together in the same order in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 1:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:">2Thessalonians 1:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Was not yea and nay, but in</span> <span class= "bld">him was yea.</span>--From the forensic point of view, this was, of course, hardly an adequate defence against the charge of inconsistency. The argument was, so to speak, one of ethical congruity. It was infinitely unlikely that one who preached Christ, the absolutely True Christ, who enforced every precept with the emphatic "Amen, Amen" (the word occurs thirty-one times in St. Matthew, fourteen times in St. Mark, seven times in St. Luke, and in its reduplicated form twenty-five times in St. John), "Verily, verily," should afterwards be shamelessly untruthful, and use words that paltered with a double sense.<p><span class= "bld">But</span> <span class= "bld">in</span> <span class= "bld">him was yea.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">but in him Yea has been and still is so,</span> as His great characterising word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. This is a proof of what he has just said. His preaching was as firm as a rock; for, tried by time, it had proved itself a changeless" yea," being a preaching of Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. <span class="cmt_word">By me and Silvanus and Timotheus.</span> They are mentioned because they had been his companions in the <span class="accented">first</span> visit to Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a>), and he wishes to show that his preaching of Christ had never wavered. "Silvanus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>) is the "Silas" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>. He disappears from the New Testament in this verse, unless he be the "Silvanus" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Was not yea and nay, but in him was yea</span>. "Became not (proved not to be) yes and no (in one breath, as it were, and therefore utterly untrustworthy), but in him there has been a yea." The perfect, "has become," means that in him the everlasting" yes" has proved itself valid, and still continues to be a changeless affirmation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
