The opening words of the Epistle are nearly identical with those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,">1Corinthians 1:1</a>. Timotheus, however, takes the place of Sosthenes, having apparently left Corinth before the arrival of the First Epistle, or, possibly, not having reached it. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) It is natural to think of him as acting in this instance, as in others where the Apostle joins his name with his own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm" title=" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,">Colossians 1:1</a>), as St. Paul's amanuensis.<p><span class= "bld">With all the saints.</span>--On the term "saints," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-13.htm" title="Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:">Acts 9:13</a>. The term Achaia, which does not occur in the opening of 1 Cor., includes the whole of the Roman province, and was probably used to take in the disciples of Cenchreae (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>) as well as those of Corinth, and possibly also those of Athens.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the will of God</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>). In the face of Judaizing opponents, it was essential that he should vindicate his independent apostolate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-15.htm">Acts 26:15-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Timothy.</span> Timothy had been absent from St. Paul when he wrote the First Epistle, and Sosthenes had taken his place, whether as amanuensis or merely as a sort of joint authenticator. Our brother; literally, <span class="accented">the brother</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>. The brotherhood applies both to St. Paul and to the Corinthians; there was a special bond of brotherhood between all members of "the household of faith." <span class="cmt_word">The saints</span>. Before the name "Christians" had come into general use, "saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-13.htm">Acts 9:13</a>) and "brethren" were common designations or' those who were "faithful in Christ Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In all Achaia.</span> In its classical sense Achaia means only the northern strip of the Peloponnesus; as a Roman province the name included both Hellas and the Peloponnesus. Hero St. Paul probably <span class="accented">uses</span> it in its narrower sense. The only <span class="accented">strictly</span> Achaian Church of which we know is Cenchrea, but doubtless there were little Christian communities along the coasts of the Corinthian gulf. To the Church at Athens St. Paul never directly alludes. This letter was not in any sense an encyclical letter; but even if it were not read in other communities, the Corinthians would convey to them the apostle's greeting. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 We are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. The Lord is able to give peace to the troubled conscience, and to calm the raging passions of the soul. These blessings are given by him, as the Father of his redeemed family. It is our Saviour who says, Let not your heart be troubled. All comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts are in him. He speaks peace to souls by granting the free remission of sins; and he comforts them by the enlivening influences of the Holy Spirit, and by the rich mercies of his grace. He is able to bind up the broken-hearted, to heal the most painful wounds, and also to give hope and joy under the heaviest sorrows. The favours God bestows on us, are not only to make us cheerful, but also that we may be useful to others. He sends comforts enough to support such as simply trust in and serve him. If we should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet we may then trust God, who can bring back even from death. Their hope and trust were not in vain; nor shall any be ashamed who trust in the Lord. Past experiences encourage faith and hope, and lay us under obligation to trust in God for time to come. And it is our duty, not only to help one another with prayer, but in praise and thanksgiving, and thereby to make suitable returns for benefits received. Thus both trials and mercies will end in good to ourselves and others.</body></html>
