The question meets us, however, When had the Corinthians heard of the plan thus detailed? It had been already abandoned, as we have seen, before the first Epistle was despatched. Had it been communicated in a lost letter (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1Corinthians 5:9</a>)? or was this what Timotheus, who started before the first letter was written (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1Corinthians 4:17</a>), had been authorised to announce? Either alternative is possible, and there is no evidence to enable us to decide which is most probable.<p><span class= "bld">Do I purpose according to the flesh . . .?</span>--The construction is somewhat involved. He may mean: (1) "Do I form my purposes after the flesh" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from worldly motives), "so as to catch the praise of consistency from those who harp on the rule that 'Yes should be yes, and No, no'?" or (2) "Am I weak and worldly in my purpose, changing my plans, and saying <span class= "ital">'</span>Yes' and 'No' in almost the same breath?" On the whole, (2) seems to give the better sense. It is obvious that the words on which he dwells had been used of him by others. Some teacher of the party of the circumcision had, apparently, quoted the rule of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-37.htm" title="But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no: for whatever is more than these comes of evil.">Matthew 5:37</a>) and of St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a>), and had asked, with a sneer, when the First Epistle came and showed that the original plan had been abandoned, whether this was the way in which St. Paul acted on it? The passage has accordingly the interest of being indirectly a reference to our Lord's teaching, showing, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>, that "the words of the Lord Jesus" were habitually cited as rules of life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I therefore was thus minded.</span> Without saying in so many words that all this plan was now given up, he proceeds to defend himself against the charges which had been evidently brought against him by his opponents. The Corinthians were aware that he no longer meant to come to them direct from Ephesus. They had certainly been informed of this by Titus, and he had indeed briefly stated it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>. Their disappointment had led some of them into angry criticisms upon the "indecision" of the apostle, the more so because he had (out of kindness, as he here shows) spared them the pain of expressing his <span class="accented">reasons</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Did I use lightness?</span> Was this change of plan a sign of "the levity" with which some of you charge me? <span class="cmt_word">Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,</span> etc.? Every phrase in this clause is of ambiguous meaning. For instance, the "or" may imply <span class="accented">another</span> charge, namely, that his purposes are <span class="accented">carnal</span>, and therefore capricious; or it may be the alternative view of his conduct, stated by way of self-defence - namely, "Does my change of plan imply that I am frivolous? or, on the contrary, are not my plans of necessity mere <span class="accented">human</span> plans, and therefore liable to be overruled by God's will?" Thus the meaning of the "or" is doubtful, and also the meaning of" <span class="accented">according to the flesh</span>." Generally this phrase is used in a bad sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-2.htm">2 Corinthians 10:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; but it may also be used to mean "in a human way," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay.</span> There is probably no clause in the New Testament of which the certain sense must be left so indeterminate as this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Authorized Version gives one way of taking the clause. The grammar equally admits of the rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">That with me the yea should be yea, and the nay nay</span>. Whichever rendering we adept, it may be explained in accordance with the view indicated in the last note. "I was not showing the levity which my opponents speak of, but my purposes are necessarily mere human purposes, and therefore my 'yes' and 'no' can be only 'yes' and 'no' when I make a plan. My 'yes' or 'no' may be overruled by the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>) or even hindered by Satan, and that more than once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>)." "With me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as far as I am concerned, I can only say "yes" or" no;" but <span class="accented">l'homme propose, Dieu dispose</span>. His intended double visit to them was prevented, not by any frivolity of his, but, as he afterwards shows, by their own unfaithfulness and his desire to spare them. There is yet a third way of taking it which involves a different meaning - "In order that with me the 'yea yea ' may be also ' nay nay,'" Am I inconsistent? or, are my purposes merely carnal purposes, in order that my "yes yes" may be, as far as I am concerned, no better than "no no" - like the mere shifting feebleness of an aimless man? A fourth way of taking the clause, adopted by St. Chrysostom and many others, is, "Do I plan after the flesh, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with carnal obstinacy, so that my ' yea' and 'nay' must be carried out at all costs?' This suggestion can hardly be right; for St. Paul was charged, not with obstinacy, but with indecision. The phrases, "yea" and "nay," as mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>, throw no light on the passage, unless indeed some one had misquoted against St. Paul our Lord's words as a reason for adhering inviolably to a plan once formed. Of these various methods I adopt the first, because it seems to be, on the whole, most in accordance with the context. For on that view of the passage he contents himself with the remark that it cannot be inconsistency or levity on his part to alter plans which are liable to all the chance and change of ordinary circumstances; and then tells them that there was one part of his teaching which has nothing to do with mere human weakness, but was God's everlasting , "yes;" after which he explains to them the reason why he decided not to come to them until he had first visited Macedonia, and so to give them one visit, not two. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
