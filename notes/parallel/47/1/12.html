With the feeling of jubilant thankfulness which has hitherto characterised his language there mingles another of a different character. It had, perhaps, been in the background of his thoughts all along. He had seemed, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1Corinthians 4:21</a>, to imply that he was coming to take strong measures against evil-doers ("Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love?"). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-2.htm" title="On the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.">1Corinthians 16:2-8</a> he had spoken yet more definitely, "I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia." And yet he had not come. Titus would seem to have told him what was said of this: "He was fickle, and changeable; said Yes one day, and No another. Perhaps he was afraid to come." He is eager to refute the charge without a formal pleading as in answer to it, and seems to cast about for an opening. He finds it in the words which he had just dictated. He has a right to assume that the Corinthians will pray and give thanks for him, for he can boast that he has never failed, conscience bearing him witness, in transparent sincerity to them.<p><span class= "bld">The testimony of our conscience.</span>--The words present an obviously undesigned coincidence with St. Paul's language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>, and again with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a>. To have nothing on his conscience, to "know nothing by (<span class= "ital">i.e., against</span>) himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.">1Corinthians 4:4</a>), was the great law of his life. And this was true, as of his whole life in relation to the Corinthians, so especially of the supposed change of purpose with which he had been taunted.<p><span class= "bld">In simplicity.</span>--The better MSS. give "holiness" instead of "simplicity." The Greek word for the latter is very characteristic of this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God.">2Corinthians 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;">2Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2Corinthians 11:3</a>), but then it is used in these passages in quite another sense, as of a single-minded generosity. The word for "holiness" is not a common one, but it appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-10.htm" title="For they truly for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.">Hebrews 12:10</a>. It was, however, the natural correlative of the term "saints" applied to all believers. St. Paul's conscience told him that he had not been false to the <span class= "ital">consecrated</span> character which that term involved.<p><span class= "bld">Godly sincerity.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">sincerity which is of God.</span> It is seldom satisfactory to tone down the bold vigour of the Greek, or perhaps Hebrew, idiom into the tameness of an English adjective. The sincerity which St. Paul claims had come to him as God's gift: he could submit it to God's judgment. The word for "sincerity" (literally, <span class= "ital">transparency of character,</span> or, perhaps, that which bore the test of the strongest light) had been used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in</span> or <span class= "ital">with</span> in both clauses. The words indicate the same line of thought as those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.">1Corinthians 2:1-6</a>. Men made invidious comparisons between his plainness of speech and the eloquent wisdom of some other teachers. That kind of "fleshly," <span class= "ital">i.e., worldly,</span> wisdom he disclaims. It was not that, but the favour or the "grace" of God which was the motive-force of his action, the sphere in which he lived and moved.<p><span class= "bld">We have had our conversation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">we conducted ourselves.</span> The tense of the Greek verb implies a special reference in thought to the time when he had been at Corinth. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to note that "conversation" means "conduct," but as the first occurrence of the word in the New Testament, it may be well to trace the several stages through which it has passed. On its appearance in English, as in Chaucer, it has its full etymological force as indicating, as it does here, habitual conduct. "Enquire of his <span class= "ital">conversation</span> and of his life before" (<span class= "ital">Tale of Melib?us</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> So in Wiclif's version of the Bible it is used, as in that of 1611, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm" title="For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:">Galatians 1:13</a>. In somewhat later writers, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in Sidney and Strype, the sense becomes that of "conduct <span class= "ital">with</span> others," "converse, intercourse," a sense still prominent in the familiar legal term for adultery. In Swift and Cowper it has come to be all but absolutely identified with the intercourse which is carried on by talking. In its fullest sense, the Apostle can say that he had striven to <span class= "ital">live</span> everywhere so as to avoid giving grounds for suspicion. Nowhere had he been more careful so to live than at Corinth, where men were suspicious in proportion to their own viciousness. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2Corinthians 7:1-2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> <span class="accented">- Vindication of his right to their sympathy</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For our rejoicing</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for our boasting is this</span>. My expression of confidence in your sympathy with me may sound like a boast, but my boast merely accords with the testimony of my conscience that I have been sincere and honest to all, and most of all to you. <span class="cmt_word">The testimony of our conscience.</span> To this St. Paul frequently appeals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In simplicity;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in holiness</span>. The best reading is <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, K), not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. "Holiness" seems to have been altered to "simplicity," both on dogmatic grounds and because it is a rare word, only occurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And godly sincerity;</span> literally, <span class="accented">sincerity of God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sincerity which is a gift of Divine grace (comp.

The grace of God was the atmosphere which the apostle breathed, the sphere in which he worked. <span class="cmt_word">We have had our conversation.</span> We lived and moved. The word "conversation" originally meant "mode of life," and is used to translate both <span class="accented">anastrophe</span> and <span class="accented">politeuma</span>, which means properly "citizenship." The exclusive modern sense of "conversation" is not earlier than the last century. <span class="cmt_word">In the world;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in my general life as regards all men. <span class="cmt_word">More abundantly to you-ward.</span> Sincerity, holiness, the signs of the grace of God, were specially shown by the apostle towards the Corinthians, because they were specially needed to guide his relations towards a Church which inspired him with deep affection, but which required special wisdom to guide and govern. The fact that, in spite of all his exceptional care, such bitter taunts could still be levelled at him, shows that he had not been mistaken in supposing that no Church required from him a more anxious watchfulness over all his conduct. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-14 Though, as a sinner, the apostle could only rejoice and glory in Christ Jesus, yet, as a believer, he might rejoice and glory in being really what he professed. Conscience witnesses concerning the steady course and tenor of the life. Thereby we may judge ourselves, and not by this or by that single act. Our conversation will be well ordered, when we live and act under such a gracious principle in the heart. Having this, we may leave our characters in the Lord's hands, but using proper means to clear them, when the credit of the gospel, or our usefulness, calls for it.</body></html>
