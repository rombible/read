At this point, to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>, he enters for the first time on the kindly reasons which had led him to forego his intended earlier visit. He uses a similar adjuration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; and although these appeals (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm">Galatians 1:20</a>) may be due in part to the emotional fervour of his temperament, yet he would hardly have resorted to them in this self defence, if the calumnies of his enemies had not gained much credence. The French proverb, <span class="accented">Qui s'excuse s'accuse</span>, is often grossly abused. The refutation of lies and slanders is often a duty, not because they injure us, but because, by diminishing our usefulness, they may injure others. <span class="cmt_word">Upon my soul.</span> Not "to take vengeance on my soul if I lie," but to confirm the appeal of its honesty and integrity. By the use of such "oaths for confirmation," St. Paul, no less than other apostles, shows that he understood our Lord's rule, "Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay," as applying to the principle of simple and unvarnished truthfulness of intercourse, which requires no further confirmation; but not as a rigid exclusion of the right to appeal to God in solemn cases and for good reasons. <span class="cmt_word">To spare you.</span> This postponement of the intended visit was a sign of .<span class="accented">forbearance</span>, for which they should have been grateful. After all that he had heard of <span class="accented">them</span>, if he had come at all, it could only have been "with a rod" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I came not as yet.</span> The rendering is erroneous. It literally means "I no longer came," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I forbore to come as I had intended. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.</body></html>
