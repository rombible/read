St. Paul continues his explanation. He did not wish to come again, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to make his second visit to Corinth, in grief, and if he had carried out his first plan that would have been the almost inevitable result. He consulted his own feelings (<span class= "ital">"for</span> myself") as well as theirs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I determined this</span>. The division of chapters is here unfortunate, since this and the next three verses belong to the paragraph which began at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>. The verb means, literally, "I judged," but is rightly rendered "determined," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-37.htm">1 Corinthians 7:37</a>. He is contrasting his <span class="accented">final decision</span> with his original <span class="accented">desire</span>, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm">2 Corinthians 1:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With myself;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for myself</span>; as the best course which I could take. <span class="cmt_word">That I would net come again to you in heaviness.</span> The "again" in the true reading is not placed immediately before the verb, but it seems (as Theodoret says) to belong to it, so that the meaning is <span class="accented">not</span> "that I would not pay you a <span class="accented">second</span> sad visit," but "that <span class="accented">my second visit to you</span> should not be a sad one." There have been interminable discussions, founded on this expression and on ch. 13:1, as to whether St. Paul had up to the time of writing this letter visited Corinth <span class="accented">twice</span> or only <span class="accented">once</span>. There is no question that only one visit is recorded in the Acts (Acts 18:1-18) previous to the one which he paid to this Church after this Epistle had been sent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2, 3</a>). If he paid them a second brief, sad, and unrecorded visit, it can only have been during his long stay in Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8, 10</a>). But the possibility of this does not seem to be recognized in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>, where he speaks of his work at Ephesus "night and day" during this period. The assumption of such a visit, as we shall see, is not necessitated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>, but in any case we know nothing whatever about the details of the visit, even if there was one, and the question, being supremely unimportant, is hardly worth the time which has been spent upon it. If he <span class="accented">had</span> paid such a visit, it would be almost unaccountable that there should be no reference to it in the First Epistle, and here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a> he refers only to one occasion on which he had preached Christ in Corinth. Each fresh review of the circumstances convinces me more strongly that the notion of <span class="accented">three</span> visits to Corinth, of which one is unrecorded, is a needless and mistaken inference, due to unimaginative literalism in interpreting one or two phrases, and encumbered with difficulties on every side. In <span class="accented">heaviness</span>. The expression applies as much to the Corinthians as to himself, he did not wish his second visit to Corinth to be a painful one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 The apostle desired to have a cheerful meeting with them; and he had written in confidence of their doing what was to their benefit and his comfort; and that therefore they would be glad to remove every cause of disquiet from him. We should always give pain unwillingly, even when duty requires that it must be given.</body></html>
