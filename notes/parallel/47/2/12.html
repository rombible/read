He returns to the train of thought which it had interrupted, and continues his narrative of what had passed after he had written the First Epistle. (On Troas, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-8.htm" title="And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.">Acts 16:8</a>.) A Church had probably been founded in that city by St. Luke, but St. Paul's first visit to it had been limited to a few days, and there are no traces of his preaching there. Now he comes "for the gospel's sake." That there was a flourishing Christian community some months later, we find from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">A door was opened unto me.</span>--Opportunities for mission-work, as we should call them, are thus described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm" title="For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.">1Corinthians 16:9</a>.

Not "the Troas." St. Paul had to do with the city, not with the district. The city (now <span class="accented">Eski Stamboul</span>), of which the name had been changed from <span class="accented">Antigonia Troas</span> to <span class="accented">Alexandria Troas</span>, was at this time a flourishing colony (<span class="accented">Colonia Juris Italici</span>), highly favoured by the Romans as representing ancient Troy, and therefore as being the mythological cradle of their race. He visited it on his being driven from Ephesus after the tumult, a little earlier than he would naturally have left it. He had visited Troas in his second missionary journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8-11</a>), but had left it in consequence of the vision which called him to Macedonia. He now stopped there on his journey through Macedonia to Corinth, which he had announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And a door was opened unto me of the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and a door had been opened to me in the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and I found there a marked opportunity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>) for work in Christ. Some commentators, in that spirit of superfluous disquisition and idle letter-worship which is the bane of exegesis, here venture to discuss whether St. Paul was justified in neglecting this opportunity or not. Such discussions are only originated by not observing characteristic modes of expression. St. Paul merely means" circumstances would <span class="accented">otherwise</span> have been very favourable for my preaching of Christ; but I was in such a state of miserable anxiety that I lacked the strength to avail myself of them." He was no more responsible for this state of mind, which belonged to his natural temperament, than he would have been responsible for a serious illness. To say that he <span class="accented">ought</span> to have had strength of mind enough to get the mastery over his feelings is only to say that Paul ought not to have been Paul. The neglect to use the opportunity was a "hindrance" which might in one sense be assigned to God, and in another to Satan. Moreover, that the opportunity was <span class="accented">not</span> wholly lost appears from the fact that St. Paul found a flourishing Christian community at Troas when he visit, d it on his return from this very journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6, 7</a>), and that he stayed there at least once again, shortly before his martyrdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-13.htm">2 Timothy 4:13</a>). Indeed, it was probably at Troas that his <span class="accented">final</span> arrest took place (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:569, 576). <span class="accented">Of the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the sphere of Christian work. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 A believer's triumphs are all in Christ. To him be the praise and glory of all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for a Christian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance of perfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation of Jesus, as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in every place. Unto some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. They reject it to their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of life unto life: as it quickened them at first when they were dead in trespasses and sins, so it makes them more lively, and will end in eternal life. Observe the awful impressions this matter made upon the apostle, and should also make upon us. The work is great, and of ourselves we have no strength at all; all our sufficiency is of God. But what we do in religion, unless it is done in sincerity, as in the sight of God, is not of God, does not come from him, and will not reach to him. May we carefully watch ourselves in this matter; and seek the testimony of our consciences, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that as of sincerity, so speak we in Christ and of Christ.</body></html>
