The Apostle's last move in that game had been to "give the sinner over to Satan" with a view to his ultimate deliverance. But what if Satan should outwit him, by tempting the sinner to despair or recklessness? To guard against that danger required, as it were, another move. Stratagem must be met by strategy. The man must be absolved that he may be able to resist the Tempter.<p><span class= "bld">We are not ignorant of his devices.</span>--The language comes from a wide and varied experience. St. Paul had been buffeted by a messenger of Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>); had once and again been hindered by him in his work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm" title="Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.">1Thessalonians 2:18</a>); was ever wrestling, not with flesh and blood, but with principalities and powers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>); and so he knew how the Tempter could turn even the rules of an ascetic rigour, or the remorse of a sin-burdened conscience, into an occasion of yet further and more irremediable sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest Satan should get an advantage over us;</span> literally, <span class="accented">lest we should be overreached by Satan</span>, which would have been the case if our severity had resulted in the desperation of the offender, and not in his deliverance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We are not ignorant of his devices.</span> So too in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a> we are told of the "crafty wiles of the devil." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The apostle desires them to receive the person who had done wrong, again into their communion; for he was aware of his fault, and much afflicted under his punishment. Even sorrow for sin should not unfit for other duties, and drive to despair. Not only was there danger last Satan should get advantage, by tempting the penitent to hard thoughts of God and religion, and so drive him to despair; but against the churches and the ministers of Christ, by bringing an evil report upon Christians as unforgiving; thus making divisions, and hindering the success of the ministry. In this, as in other things, wisdom is to be used, that the ministry may not be blamed for indulging sin on the one hand, or for too great severity towards sinners on the other hand. Satan has many plans to deceive, and knows how to make a bad use of our mistakes.</body></html>
