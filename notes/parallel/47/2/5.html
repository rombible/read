He will not name him. He is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1-5</a>, and here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.">2Corinthians 2:7</a>, "a man," "such a one." The abrupt introduction of the qualifying clause, "but in part," and the absence of any authoritative punctuation, makes the construction ambiguous. It admits of three possible explanations: (1) "If any have caused grief, it is not <span class= "ital">I</span> alone whom he hath grieved, but in part, to some extent--not to press the charge against <span class= "ital">him</span> too heavily--all of <span class= "ital">you"</span> They, the members of the Corinthian Church, were really the greatest sufferers from the scandal which brought shame upon it. (2) "If any have caused grief, h<span class= "ital">e</span> hath not grieved me, save in part" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> he is not the only offender), "that I may not press the charge against <span class= "ital">all of you</span>--so that I may not treat you as if you were all open to the same condemnation, or had all caused the same sorrow." (3) Combining parts of (1) and (2): "It is not <span class= "ital">I</span> whom he hath grieved, save in part, that I may not lay the blame on all of <span class= "ital">you."</span> Of these (1) seems the simplest and most natural. In any case, it is important to remember that the position of the pronoun in the Greek, "<span class= "ital">me</span> he hath not grieved," makes it specially emphatic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> <span class="accented">- The results of his letter in their treatment of the incestuous offender</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if any have caused grief.</span> The word "pain" or "grief" which has been so prominent in the last verses, naturally reminds St. Paul of the person whose misdoings had caused all this trouble. The "any" is in the singular. <span class="cmt_word">He hath not grieved me, but in part,</span> etc. Of the various ways of taking this verse, the most tenable seems to be this: "If any one has caused pain, he has not pained <span class="accented">me</span> but partly (not to weigh down too heavily) <span class="accented">all</span> of you. St. Paul is denying that the feelings with which he hat(written his severe letter were due to mere personal sorrow or indignation. In writing he felt for the wrong done to <span class="accented">them</span>, to the whole Corinthian Church, at least as much as for the smart of his own grief and disappointment. The word "partly" is introduced, as St. Chrysostom says, to soften the expression, "he has grieved <span class="accented">you all</span>." It will then mean "to a certain extent." The words, "that I may not overcharge," or rather, as in the Revised Version, "that I press not too heavily," assign the reason for the modifying clause, "in part." When St. Paul says that this man's conduct had <span class="accented">even</span> to <span class="accented">any extent</span> grieved the whole community, his words may seem to conflict with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; but he is thinking, not of the immediate condonation of the offender there alluded to, but of the agony of subsequent repentance which his letter had awoke in the whole (or practically the whole) community (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>). The phrase, "that I press not too heavily," refers then to the offender: "I will not say outright that he has grieved not <span class="accented">me, but all of you</span>, because I do not wish to bear too hard on him" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>), "but I will say that he has grieved you and me alike to some extent." The phrase, "in part," occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The apostle desires them to receive the person who had done wrong, again into their communion; for he was aware of his fault, and much afflicted under his punishment. Even sorrow for sin should not unfit for other duties, and drive to despair. Not only was there danger last Satan should get advantage, by tempting the penitent to hard thoughts of God and religion, and so drive him to despair; but against the churches and the ministers of Christ, by bringing an evil report upon Christians as unforgiving; thus making divisions, and hindering the success of the ministry. In this, as in other things, wisdom is to be used, that the ministry may not be blamed for indulging sin on the one hand, or for too great severity towards sinners on the other hand. Satan has many plans to deceive, and knows how to make a bad use of our mistakes.</body></html>
