Titus was to return to him at Troas. Not meeting him there, St. Paul, in his eager anxiety to hear something more than Timotheus had been able to tell him, left Troas, in spite of the opening which it presented for his work as a preacher of the gospel, and hastened on into Macedonia. Taking the route that he had taken before, he would probably go to Philippi, where he would find St. Luke; and we may conjecture, without much risk of error, that it was there that he and Titus met.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I had;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I have had</span>. The perfect vividly realizes the scene through which he had passed. I had no rest. St. Paul had evidently told Titus to come from his mission to Corinth and meet him at Troas. But either St. Paul reached the town earlier than he intended, or Titus had been delayed. Now, the apostle was so intensely eager to know how his rebukes had been received - the name of "Corinth" was so deeply engraven on his heart - he could so ill endure the thought of being on angry terms with converts which he so deeply loved, that the non-appearance of Titus filled him with devouring anxiety and rendered him incapable of any other work. <span class="cmt_word">In my spirit</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to my spirit</span>. It was the loftiest part of St. Paul's nature - his spirit - which was utterly incapacitated from effort by the restlessness of his miserable uncertainty about the Corinthian Church. The disclosure of such feelings ought to have had a powerful influence on the Corinthians. We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5, 9</a> that St. Paul yearned for tidings of his converts with an intensity which can hardly be realized by less fervent and self-devoted natures. <span class="cmt_word">I found not Titus my brother.</span> Not only "<span class="accented">the</span> brother," but "<span class="accented">my</span> brother;" the man whom in matters of this kind I most trusted as an affectionate and able fellow worker (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). Titus, though not mentioned in the Acts, is the most prominent person in this Epistle, and it is evident that St. Paul felt for him a warm affection and respect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-13.htm">2 Corinthians 7:13, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Taking my leave of them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the Christians in Troas.

He had doubtless told Titus to look out for him at Philippi, and expected to meet him there on his way to Troas. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 A believer's triumphs are all in Christ. To him be the praise and glory of all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for a Christian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance of perfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation of Jesus, as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in every place. Unto some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. They reject it to their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of life unto life: as it quickened them at first when they were dead in trespasses and sins, so it makes them more lively, and will end in eternal life. Observe the awful impressions this matter made upon the apostle, and should also make upon us. The work is great, and of ourselves we have no strength at all; all our sufficiency is of God. But what we do in religion, unless it is done in sincerity, as in the sight of God, is not of God, does not come from him, and will not reach to him. May we carefully watch ourselves in this matter; and seek the testimony of our consciences, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that as of sincerity, so speak we in Christ and of Christ.</body></html>
