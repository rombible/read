He had wished to avoid a visit that would cause sorrow to himself and others, and events had shown that he was right. But it might be said, perhaps had been said, that he didn't seem to care about giving pain when he wrote, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.">1Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1Corinthians 5:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?">1Corinthians 6:5-8</a>. "Yes," is his answer; "but then the pain which <span class= "ital">I</span> inflict" (the pronoun is emphatic) "gives to him who suffers it the power of giving me joy, and so works out an ample compensation;" a thought to which he returns in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.">2Corinthians 7:8</a>. The abruptness of the question and the use of the singular number shows that he has the one great offender, the incestuous adulterer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1</a>, before his mind's eye.

"For if I pain you, who then is it that gladdens me except he who is being pained by me?" The "<span class="accented">I"</span> being expressed in the original, is emphatic, and the verse has none of the strange selfish meaning which has been assigned to <span class="accented">it</span>, namely, that St. Paul thought "the grief which he had caused to be amply compensated for by the pleasure he received from that grief." It has the much simpler meaning that he was unwilling to pain those who gladdened him, and therefore would not pay them a visit which could only be <span class="accented">painful</span> on both sides, when the normal relation between them should be one of <span class="accented">joy</span> on both sides, as he has already said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-24.htm">2 Corinthians 1:24</a>). The singular, "he who is being pained by me<span class="accented"></span>," does not refer to the offender, but to the Corinthians collectively. <span class="cmt_word">Who is he then,</span> etc.? The "then" in the original is classically and elegantly expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, <span class="accented">and</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-4.htm">James 2:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 The apostle desired to have a cheerful meeting with them; and he had written in confidence of their doing what was to their benefit and his comfort; and that therefore they would be glad to remove every cause of disquiet from him. We should always give pain unwillingly, even when duty requires that it must be given.</body></html>
