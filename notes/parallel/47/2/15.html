Here the mind of the writer turns to the sterner, sadder side of the Roman triumph. Some who appeared in that triumph were <span class= "ital">on their way to deliverance,</span> some <span class= "ital">on their way to perish</span> (this is the exact rendering of the words translated <span class= "ital">saved</span> and <span class= "ital">lost</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and this also has its analogue in the triumph of Christ. He does not shrink from that thought. In his belief in the righteousness and mercy of Christ, he is content to leave the souls of all men to His judgment. He will not the less do his work as incense-bearer, and let the "sweet savour" of the knowledge of God be wafted through the words which it has been given him to utter. All things are for His glory, for His righteousness will be seen to have been working through all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ.</span> The undeveloped metaphor involved in these words is that "we and our preaching diffuse to God's glory the knowledge of Christ which is as a sweet savour." The apostles are identified with their work; they were as the incense, crushed and burned, but diffusing everywhere a waft of perfume. St. Paul is still thinking of the incense burnt in the streets of Rome during a triumph - "Dabimusque Divis Tura benignis" (Horace, 'Od.,' 4:2.51) - though his expression recalls the "odour of a sweet smell," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>); see on this passage the excellent note of Bishop Wordsworth. <span class="cmt_word">In them that are saved, and in them that perish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among those who are perishing and those who are being saved</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>). The odour is fragrant to God, though those who breathe it may be variously affected by it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 A believer's triumphs are all in Christ. To him be the praise and glory of all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for a Christian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance of perfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation of Jesus, as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in every place. Unto some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. They reject it to their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of life unto life: as it quickened them at first when they were dead in trespasses and sins, so it makes them more lively, and will end in eternal life. Observe the awful impressions this matter made upon the apostle, and should also make upon us. The work is great, and of ourselves we have no strength at all; all our sufficiency is of God. But what we do in religion, unless it is done in sincerity, as in the sight of God, is not of God, does not come from him, and will not reach to him. May we carefully watch ourselves in this matter; and seek the testimony of our consciences, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that as of sincerity, so speak we in Christ and of Christ.</body></html>
