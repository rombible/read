Even then the ways of error were manifold, and the way of truth was one. Among Judaisers, and the seekers after Greek wisdom, asserters of license for liberty, questioners of the resurrection: how few were those who preached the true word of God in its purity! The word for "corrupt," formed from a word which signifies "huckster" or "tavern-keeper," implies an adulteration like that which such people commonly practised. We, says St. Paul, play no such tricks of trade with what we preach; we do not meet the tastes of our hearers by prophesying deceits. The very fact that we know the tremendous issues of our work would hinder that. Comp. St. Peter's use of the same figure in "the sincere (the <span class= "ital">unadulterated</span>) milk of the <span class= "ital">reason"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-2.htm" title="As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:">1Peter 2:2</a>). It is doubtful whether the imagery of the triumph is still present to his thoughts. If it were, we may think of the word "corrupt" as connected with the thought of the sweet savour: "Our incense, at any rate, is pure. If it brings death it is through no fault of ours. It is not a poisoned perfume."<p><span class= "bld">As of sincerity, but as of God.</span>--The two clauses are half connected, half contrasted. To have said "of sincerity" alone would have been giving too much prominence to what was purely subjective. He could not feel sure that he was sincere unless he knew that his sincerity was given to him by God. (For the word "sincerity," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2Corinthians 1:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we are not as many;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as the many</span>. This clause is introduced to show how much courage and effort the work requires. "The many" might, by Greek idiom, mean "the majority." The apparent harshness of the assertion that the majority of teachers in the apostolic age dealt untruly with the Word of God, led to the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, the rest, in some manuscripts (D, E, F, G, L). But "the many" here means "the many antagonists of mine," who preach a different gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>). It must be remembered that conceit, Pharisaism, moral laxity, and factions were all at work in the Corinthian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Which corrupt.</span> The Word means who are merely" trafficking with," "adulterating<span class="accented"></span>," "huckstering<span class="accented"></span>," the Word of life. The word occurs in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>; Ecclus. 26:29; and Plato applies the same metaphor to the sophists, who peddle their wisdom about ('Protag.,' p. 313 d). The substantive <span class="accented">kapelos</span> means "a retail dealer," and especially a vintner, and the verb <span class="accented">kapeleuo is</span> always used in a bad sense, like the English "to huckster." Such deceitful dealers with the gospel are described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a>, and in one of the Ignatian letters they are called <span class="accented">Christemporoi</span>, Christ-traffickers. Such were those who altered the perspective of the gospel, lowered its standard, and adulterated it with strange admixtures. Their methods and their teaching are constantly alluded to in these Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-4</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>, etc.), <span class="cmt_word">But as of sincerity, but as of God.</span> lake one who speaks from the sincerity of his heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>) and by the inspiration of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">1 Corinthians 14:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Before God speak we in Christ.</span> The <span class="accented">sphere</span> of our teaching as of our life is Christ; and our work is done <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"As ever in our great Taskmaster's eye."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 A believer's triumphs are all in Christ. To him be the praise and glory of all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for a Christian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance of perfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation of Jesus, as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in every place. Unto some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. They reject it to their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of life unto life: as it quickened them at first when they were dead in trespasses and sins, so it makes them more lively, and will end in eternal life. Observe the awful impressions this matter made upon the apostle, and should also make upon us. The work is great, and of ourselves we have no strength at all; all our sufficiency is of God. But what we do in religion, unless it is done in sincerity, as in the sight of God, is not of God, does not come from him, and will not reach to him. May we carefully watch ourselves in this matter; and seek the testimony of our consciences, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that as of sincerity, so speak we in Christ and of Christ.</body></html>
