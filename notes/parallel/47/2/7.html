The time had come for words of pardon and comfort and counsel. What if he should be "swallowed up," and sink as in the great deep of sorrow? Suicide, madness, apostasy, seem to float before his mind as but too possible results.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Contrariwise</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> contrary to the line taken or to the view expressed by the severer portion of the community. <span class="cmt_word">Rather</span>. The word is omitted in A and B. <span class="cmt_word">To forgive him</span>. The word is used of the mutual attitude of gracious forbearance which ought to exist among Christians(Forgiving one another," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>), so that they might be not only Christians, but as Gentiles ignorantly called them, <span class="accented">Chrestians</span> (" kind-hearted," Ephesians 4:82). <span class="cmt_word">And comfort</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "strengthen," "encourage." The "him" is emitted in the Greek, with the same delicate, compassionate reticence which leads St. Paul to speak of this person "a man of such of a kind." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a> St. Paul suddenly breaks off the course of his remarks to give similar advice in a tone of peculiar solemnity; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a> he warns against any <span class="accented">excess</span> in the severity which he enjoins in the previous verse. <span class="cmt_word">Such a one</span>.

In the Greek it is compassionately placed last in the clause. <span class="cmt_word">Should be swallowed up</span>. The same metaphor, of being swallowed in an abyss, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> it is said that Satan is ever striving to "swallow up" men. <span class="cmt_word">With overmuch sorrow;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with the</span>, or <span class="accented">his, excessive grief</span>. Despair might drive the man to suicide, or apostasy, or the wretchlessness of unclean living. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The apostle desires them to receive the person who had done wrong, again into their communion; for he was aware of his fault, and much afflicted under his punishment. Even sorrow for sin should not unfit for other duties, and drive to despair. Not only was there danger last Satan should get advantage, by tempting the penitent to hard thoughts of God and religion, and so drive him to despair; but against the churches and the ministers of Christ, by bringing an evil report upon Christians as unforgiving; thus making divisions, and hindering the success of the ministry. In this, as in other things, wisdom is to be used, that the ministry may not be blamed for indulging sin on the one hand, or for too great severity towards sinners on the other hand. Satan has many plans to deceive, and knows how to make a bad use of our mistakes.</body></html>
