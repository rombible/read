Keeping the image of the triumph in his mind, he thinks of the widely different impression and effect which the odour of the incense would work in the two classes of the prisoners. To some it would seem to be as a breath from Paradise, giving life and health; to others its sweetness would seem sickly and pestilential, coming as from a charnel house, having in it the "savour of death," and leading to death as its issue.<p><span class= "bld">And who is sufficient for these things?</span>--The question forced itself on St. Paul's mind as it forces itself on the mind of every true teacher, Who can feel qualified for a work which involves such tremendous issues? If we ask how it was that he did not draw back from it altogether, the answer is found in other words of his: "God has made us able (<span class= "ital">sufficient</span>) ministers of the New Testament" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6</a>); "our sufficiency is of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;">2Corinthians 3:5</a>). It is obvious that even here he assumes his sufficiency, and gives in the next verse the ground of the assumption.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The savour of death unto death;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a savour from death to death</span>. To those who are perishing, the incense of the Name of Christ which our work enables them to breathe, seems to rise from death, and to lead to death. They (for here again the outlines of the metaphor shift) are like the doomed captives, who, as they breathed the incense on the day of triumph, knew where that triumph would lead them before the victors can climb the Capitol. To them it would seem to bring with it not "airs from heaven," but wafts from the abyss. So Christ was alike for the fall and for the rising again of many (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>). To some he was a Stone of stumbling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>), which grinds to powder those on whom it falls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>). This contrast between the intended effect of the gospel as the power and wisdom of God, and its <span class="accented">accidental</span> effect, through man's sin and blindness which converts it into a source of judgment, is often alluded to in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18, 23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>, etc.). St. Paul is fond of intensified expressions, like "from death unto death," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; "from faith to faith," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Savour of life unto life;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a savour from life</span>, as before. It came from the Source of life; it is issued in the sole reality of life. Similarly the rabbis spoke of the Law as "an aroma" alike of death and of life. "Why are the words of the Law likened to princes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>)? Because, like princes, <span class="accented">they have the power to kill and to give life</span>. Rays said to those that walk on its right, the Law is a medicine of life; to those that walk on the left side, a <span class="accented">medicine of death"</span> ('Shabbath,' f. 88, 2; 'Yoma,' f. 72, 2) Everything is as a two-edged sword. All Christian privileges are, as they are used, either blessings or banes (Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And who is sufficient for these things?</span> St. Paul always implies that nothing but the grace of God could enable him to discharge the great duty laid upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 A believer's triumphs are all in Christ. To him be the praise and glory of all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for a Christian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance of perfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation of Jesus, as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in every place. Unto some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. They reject it to their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of life unto life: as it quickened them at first when they were dead in trespasses and sins, so it makes them more lively, and will end in eternal life. Observe the awful impressions this matter made upon the apostle, and should also make upon us. The work is great, and of ourselves we have no strength at all; all our sufficiency is of God. But what we do in religion, unless it is done in sincerity, as in the sight of God, is not of God, does not come from him, and will not reach to him. May we carefully watch ourselves in this matter; and seek the testimony of our consciences, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that as of sincerity, so speak we in Christ and of Christ.</body></html>
