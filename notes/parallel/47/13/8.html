The first impression which the words convey is that he is asserting his own thoroughness as a champion of the truth, so that it was a moral impossibility for him to do anything against it. The true sequence of thought, however, though it does not exclude that meaning, compels us to read much more between the lines. "Yes," he says, "we are content to seem to fail, as regards the exercise of our apostolic power to chastise offenders; for the condition of that power is that it is never exercised against the truth, and therefore if you walk in the truth, there will be no opening for its exercise." The feeling is analogous to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a> : "I could wish myself accursed from Christ for my brethren's sake;" perhaps also to that of the Baptist: "He must increase, but I must decrease" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-30.htm" title="He must increase, but I must decrease.">John 3:30</a>); perhaps, yet again, to that of the patriot dying with the prayer, "May my name be without honour if only my country may be saved."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We can do nothing against the truth.</span> I am powerless against anything which is true, real, sincere; I can exercise no power except in the cause of the truth.

We have far more need to pray that we may not do evil, than that we may not suffer evil. The apostle not only desired that they might be kept from sin, but also that they might grow in grace, and increase in holiness. We are earnestly to pray to God for those we caution, that they may cease to do evil, and learn to do well; and we should be glad for others to be strong in the grace of Christ, though it may be the means of showing our own weakness. let us also pray that we may be enabled to make a proper use of all our talents.</body></html>
