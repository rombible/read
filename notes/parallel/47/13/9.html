We may think of the weakness of his bodily presence, of his physical infirmities, of the apparent failure of his supernatural powers because the condition of the Corinthian Church, as walking in faith and truth, presented no opening for their exercise. He can find cause for joy in all these, if only the disciples whom he loves are strong with the strength of God.<span class= "bld"><p>This also we wish, even your perfection.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">your restoration.</span> This is the only passage in the New Testament in which the word occurs; but the corresponding verb is found in the <span class= "ital">"mending</span> their nets" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm" title="And when he had gone a little farther there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.">Mark 1:19</a>, and in the "restore" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>. Its proper meaning is to bring back to completeness. This, then, was what the Apostle had been aiming at all along. In his seeming harshness and self-assertion, as in his overflowing tenderness, he was looking forward to their restoration to their first love and their first purity. He would rather threaten than act, even at the cost of the threat appearing an empty vaunt, if only he might be spared the necessity for acting.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When we are weak, and ye are strong</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-8.htm">1 Corinthians 4:8-10</a>). <span class="accented">Strong</span>; "powerful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We wish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">we pray. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Your perfection;</span> rather, <span class="accented">your perfect union</span>; "the <span class="accented">readjustment</span> of your disordered elements."

We have far more need to pray that we may not do evil, than that we may not suffer evil. The apostle not only desired that they might be kept from sin, but also that they might grow in grace, and increase in holiness. We are earnestly to pray to God for those we caution, that they may cease to do evil, and learn to do well; and we should be glad for others to be strong in the grace of Christ, though it may be the means of showing our own weakness. let us also pray that we may be enabled to make a proper use of all our talents.</body></html>
