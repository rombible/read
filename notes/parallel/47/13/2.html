The chief objects of this rigour were to be those whom he had described previously as "having sinned beforehand" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2Corinthians 12:21</a>); but he adds that his work as judge will extend to <span class= "ital">all the rest</span> of the offenders. What he has in view is obviously passing a sentence of the nature of an excommunication on the offenders, "delivering them to Satan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1Timothy 1:20</a>), with the assured confidence that that sentence would be followed by some sharp bodily suffering. In that case men would have, as he says in the next verse, a crucial <span class= "ital">test</span> whether Christ was speaking in him, and learn that he whom they despised as <span class= "ital">infirm</span> had a reserve-force of spiritual power, showing itself in supernatural effects even in the regions of man's natural life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I told you before;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have told you before. <span class="cmt_word"></span>As if I were present, the second time.</span> The meaning seems to be, "You must understand this announcement as distinctly as if I were with you, and uttered it by word of mouth." <span class="cmt_word">And being absent now I write;</span> rather, <span class="accented">so now being absent.</span> The verb "I write" is almost certainly an explanatory gloss. <span class="cmt_word">And to all other;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and to the rest, all of them.</span> Namely, to those who, though they may not have fallen into gross sin, still rejected St. Paul's authority, and said that he was afraid to come in person. <span class="cmt_word">I will not spare</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; 2 Corinthians 4:19, 21). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet he will not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare those who remain obstinate and impenitent. Christ at his crucifixion, appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.</body></html>
