"Rejoice--let that be our last word to you."<p><span class= "bld">Be perfect.</span>--Better, as before, <span class= "ital">restore yourselves to completeness; amend yourselves.</span> In the words "be of good comfort" (better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">be comforted,</span> with the implied thought that the comfort comes through accepting his word of counsel--see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,">Acts 4:36</a>) we trace an echo of what he had said in the opening of the Epistle, as to the "comfort" which had been given to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted of God.">2Corinthians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.">2Corinthians 1:7</a>). <span class= "ital">Paraclesis</span> in its two-fold aspect is, in fact, the key-note of the whole Epistle. Taking the verb and the noun together, the word occurs twenty-eight times in it.<p><span class= "bld">Be of one mind.</span>--The phrase was one specially characteristic of St. Paul's teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm" title="That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm" title="Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.">Philippians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2</a>). His thoughts are apparently travelling back to the schisms over which he had grieved in 1 Corinthians 1-3, and to which he had referred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2Corinthians 12:20</a>. What he seeks is the restoration of unity of purpose, and with that of inward and outward peace. If these conditions were fulfilled, the "God of love and peace would assuredly be with them," for peace rests ever upon the son of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-6.htm" title="And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on it: if not, it shall turn to you again.">Luke 10:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Finally, brethren, farewell.</span> His concluding words are marked by great gentleness, as though to heal the effects of the sharp rebuke and irony to which he has been compelled to have recourse.

God is the Author of peace and Lover of concord; he hath loved us, and is willing to be at peace with us. And let it be our constant aim so to walk, that separation from our friends may be only for a time, and that we may meet in that happy world where parting will be unknown. He wishes that they may partake all the benefits which Christ of his free grace and favour has purchased; the Father out of his free love has purposed; and the Holy Ghost applies and bestows.</body></html>
