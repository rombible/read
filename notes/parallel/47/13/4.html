For He too lived encompassed with the infirmities of man's nature, and the possibility of the crucifixion flowed from that fact, as a natural sequel.<p><span class= "bld">For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him.</span>--The thought that underlies the apparently hard saying is that the disciples of Christ share at once in their Lord's weakness and in His strength. "We, too, are weak," the Apostle says; "we have our share in infirmities and sufferings, which are ennobled by the thought that they are ours because we are His; but we know that we shall live in the highest sense, in the activities of the spiritual life, which also we share with Him, and which comes to us by the power of God; and this life will be manifested in the exercise of our spiritual power towards you and for your good." To refer the words "we shall live" to the future life of the resurrection, though the thought is, of course, true in itself, is to miss the special force of the words in relation to the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For though.</span> The "though" should be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Through weakness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">out of weakness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a result of that human weakness of our nature which he took upon him, and which rendered him liable to agony and death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But we shall live with him... toward you.</span> This thought of participation alike in Christ's humiliation and his glory, alike in his weakness and his might, was very familiar to St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19, 20</a>), Here, however, the following words," toward you," <span class="accented">i.e."</span> with reference to you," show that the life of which he is thinking is the vigorous reestablishment of his spiritual authority in Christ over the Church of Corinth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet he will not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare those who remain obstinate and impenitent. Christ at his crucifixion, appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.</body></html>
