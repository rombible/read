Apply a test to <span class= "ital">yourselves.</span> Try <span class= "ital">yourselves</span> whether you are living and moving in that faith in Christ which you profess" (the objective and subjective senses of faith melting into one without any formal distinction). "Subject <span class= "ital">yourselves</span> to the scrutiny of your own conscience." The latter word had been used in a like sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm" title="But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.">1Corinthians 11:28</a>. So far as we can distinguish between it and the Greek for "examine," the one suggests the idea of a special test, the other a general scrutiny.<p><span class= "bld">How that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</span>--On the last word see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>. Here its exact meaning is defined by the context as that of failing to pass the scrutiny to which he calls them: "Christ is in you" (the central thought of the Apostle's teaching; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>), "unless the sentence, after an impartial scrutiny by yourselves, or by a judge gifted with spiritual discernment, is that there are no tokens of His presence." The ideas which Calvinistic theology has attached to the word "reprobate" are, it need hardly be said, foreign to the true meaning of the word, both here and elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prove year ownselves.</span> In other words, "test your own sincerity." <span class="cmt_word">Jesus Christ is in you.</span> To this truth - that the body of every Christian is a temple of the Holy Spirit of Christ - St. Paul returns again and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). We find the same truth frequently in St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Except ye be reprobates.</span> The Greek word <span class="accented">adokimoi</span> - from the same root as the verb "to test" - means tried and found to be worthless. "<span class="accented">Reprobate</span> silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-30.htm">Jeremiah 6:30</a>). The word is found almost exclusively in St Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>). The only other passage of the New Testament where it occurs is <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>; and the reader must not read Calvinistic horrors into an expression which gives no sanction to them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet he will not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare those who remain obstinate and impenitent. Christ at his crucifixion, appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.</body></html>
