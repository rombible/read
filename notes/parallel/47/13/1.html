The latter interpretation falls in best with the known facts of the case, and is in entire accordance both with his language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.">2Corinthians 12:14</a>, and with his mode of expressing his intentions, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1Corinthians 16:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</span>--There seems no adequate reason for not taking these words in their simple and natural meaning. The rule, quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm" title="Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.">Numbers 35:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, was of the nature of an axiom of Jewish, one might almost say of natural, law. And it had received a fresh prominence from our Lord's reproduction of it in giving directions as for the discipline of the society which He came to found. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>.) What more natural than that St. Paul should say, "When I come, there will be no more surmises and vague suspicions, but every offence will be dealt with in a vigorous and full inquiry"? There seems something strained, almost fantastic, in the interpretation which, catching at the accidental juxtaposition of "the <span class= "ital">third</span> time" and the "<span class= "ital">three</span> witnesses," assumes that the Apostle personifies his actual or intended visits, and treats them as the witnesses whose testimony was to be decisive. It is a fatal objection to this view that it turns the judge into a prosecutor, and makes him appeal to his own reiteration of his charges as evidence of their truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the third time I am coming to you</span>.

It has been explained as a reference to <span class="accented">examinations</span> which he intended to hold on his arrival at Corinth. It is much more probable that St. Paul is representing his separate visits as separate <span class="accented">attestations</span> to the truths which he preaches. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet he will not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare those who remain obstinate and impenitent. Christ at his crucifixion, appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.</body></html>
