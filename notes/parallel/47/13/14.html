Liturg.</span> i. 251). It may be noted that it did not gain its present position in the Prayer Book of the Church of England till the version of A.D. 1662, not having appeared at all till A.D. 1559, and then only at the close of the Litany.<p>The order of the names of the three Divine Persons is itself significant. Commonly, the name of the Father precedes that of the Son, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.">2Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm" title="To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.">1Corinthians 1:3</a>. Here the order is inverted, as though in the Apostle's thoughts there was no "difference or inequality" between them, the question of priority being determined by the sequence of thought, and not by any essential distinction. To those who trace that sequence here there will seem sufficient reason for the order which we actually find. St. Paul had spoken of the comfort brought to his own soul by the words which he heard in vision from the lips of the Lord Jesus, "My <span class= "ital">grace</span> is sufficient for thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.">2Corinthians 12:9</a>). He had spoken of that <span class= "ital">grace</span> as showing itself in self-abnegation for the sake of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.">2Corinthians 8:9</a>). What more natural than that the first wish of his heart for those who were dear to him should be that that grace might be with them, working on them and assimilating them to itself? But the "favour," or "grace," which thus flowed through Christ was derived from a yet higher source. It was the love of God in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18-20</a>), the love of the Eternal Father that was thus manifested in the "grace" of the Son. Could he separate those divine acts from that of Him whom he knew at once as the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.">1Corinthians 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>.) Was it not through their participation, their fellowship in that Spirit (the phrase meets us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,">Philippians 2:1</a>) shedding down the love of God in their hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>) that the grace of Christ and the love of the Father were translated from the region of abstract thoughts or mere empty words into the realities of a living experience?<span class= "note">[60]<p>[60] The note, added by some unknown transcriber, though having no shadow of authority, is, probably, in this instance, as has been shown in the Notes on </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.">2Corinthians 8:16-22</a><span class= "note">, a legitimate inference from the <span class= "ital">data</span> furnished by the Epistle.</span><p>And so the Epistle ends, not, we may imagine, if we may once picture to ourselves the actual <span class= "ital">genesis</span> of the letter, without a certain sense of relief and of repose. It had been a hard and difficult task to dictate it. The act of dictation had been broken by the pauses of strong emotion or physical exhaustion. The Apostle had had to say things that went against the grain, of which he could not feel absolutely sure that they were the right things to say. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.">2Corinthians 11:17</a>.) And now all is done. He can look forward to coming to the Corinthian Church, not with a rod, but in love and in the spirit of meekness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1Corinthians 4:21</a>). What the actual result of that visit was we do not know in detail, but there are at least no traces of disappointment in the tone of the Epistle to the Romans, which was written during that visit. He has been welcomed with a generous hospitality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>). He has not been dis-appointed in the collection for the saints (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>) either in Macedonia or Achaia. If we trace a reminiscence of past conflicts in the warning against those who cause divisions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm" title="For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.">Romans 16:18</a>), it is rather with the calmness of one who looks back on a past danger than with the bitterness of the actual struggle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The grace of our Lord,</span> etc. This is the only place where the full apostolic benediction occurs, and is alone sufficient to prove the doctrine of the Trinity. St. Paul seems to feel that the fullest benediction is needed at the close of the severest letter. <span class="cmt_word">With you all.</span> The word "all" is here introduced with special tenderness and graciousness. Some have sinned before; some have not repented; yet he has for them all one prayer and one blessing and one "seal of holy apostolic love? The superscription, though of no authority, may here correctly state that the letter was written at Philippi, and conveyed thence to Corinth by Titus and (possibly) Luke (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16-22</a>). These are the last recorded words addressed by St. Paul to the Corinthian Church. The results produced by the letter and by his visit of three months (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2, 3</a>) were probably satisfactory, for we hear no more of any troubles at Corinth during his lifetime, and the spirit in which he writes the letter to the Romans from Corinth seems to have been unwontedly calm. He had been kindly welcomed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm">Romans 15:23</a>), and the collection, about which he had been so anxious, seems to have fully equalled his expectations, for as we know (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), he conveyed it to Jerusalem in person with the delegates of the Churches. We gain a subsequent glimpse of the Corinthian Church. Some thirty-five years later, when a letter, which is still extant, was addressed to them by St. Clement of Rome, they were still somewhat inclined to be turbulent, disunited, and sceptical (see 'Ep. ad Corinthians,' 3, 4, 13, 14, 37, etc.); but still there are some marked signs of improvement. About A.D. they were visited by Hegesippus (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 4:22), who spoke very favourably of them, especially of their obedience and liberality. Their bishop, Dionysius, was at that time exercising a widespread influence (Eusebius 'Hist. Eccl.,' 4:23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:11-14 Here are several good exhortations. God is the Author of peace and Lover of concord; he hath loved us, and is willing to be at peace with us. And let it be our constant aim so to walk, that separation from our friends may be only for a time, and that we may meet in that happy world where parting will be unknown. He wishes that they may partake all the benefits which Christ of his free grace and favour has purchased; the Father out of his free love has purposed; and the Holy Ghost applies and bestows.</body></html>
