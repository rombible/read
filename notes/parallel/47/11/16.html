He protests against the justice of the taunt. He pleads that, even if they think him "insane" (this, rather than mere foolishness, is probably the meaning of the word), they will give him the attention which, even in that case, most men would give--which they, at least, were giving to men to whom that term might far more justly be applied.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-33.</span> <span class="accented">- Apology by contrast</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say again.</span> St. Paul evidently feels an almost invincible repugnance to begin to speak of his own works.
