"They didn't come for what they could get." St. Paul, we know, more than most men, had acted on the law of which they boasted as their special distinction, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1-18</a>, in the discussion on the question of eating things sacrificed to idols, had dwelt with a pardonable fulness on his own conduct in this matter, as an example of foregoing an abstract right for the sake of a greater good. His enemies were compelled to admit this as far as his life at Corinth was concerned; but they had detected what they looked on as a grave inconsistency. He had accepted help from the churches of Macedonia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>), and in this they found ground for a two-fold charge: "He wasn't above taking money from other churches--he was only too proud to take it from that of Corinth;" and this was made matter of personal offence. To take money at all was mean; not to take it from them was contemptuous.<p>He does not deny the facts. He repeats the irritating epithet, <span class= "ital">"</span>abasing myself"; he adds the familiar antithesis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-12.htm" title="And whoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.">Matthew 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-52.htm" title="He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.">Luke 1:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm" title="For whoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11</a>), "Yes, but I did it that you might be exalted," perhaps with reference to elevation in spiritual knowledge, perhaps, because the fact that he laboured for them without payment was the greatest proof of disinterested love for them which could be given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have I?</span> literally, <span class="accented">or have I?</span> An ironical exception to his manifestation of knowledge; "unless you think that I committed a sin in refusing to accept maintenance at your hands." It is clear that even this noble generosity had been made the ground for a charge against the apostle. "If he had not been conscious," they said, "that he has no real claims, he would not have preached for nothing, when he had a perfect right to be supported by his converts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abasing myself.</span> The trade of tentmaker was despised, tedious, and mechanical, and it did not suffice to provide even for Paul's small needs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye might be exalted;</span> namely, by spiritual gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The gospel... freely.</span> Some of them would feel the vast contrast between the words.

The apostle would not give room for any to accuse him of worldly designs in preaching the gospel, that others who opposed him at Corinth, might not in this respect gain advantage against him. Hypocrisy may be looked for, especially when we consider the great power which Satan, who rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience, has upon the minds of many. And as there are temptations to evil conduct, so there is equal danger on the other side. It serves Satan's purposes as well, to set up good works against the atonement of Christ, and salvation by faith and grace. But the end will discover those who are deceitful workers; their work will end in ruin. Satan will allow his ministers to preach either the law or the gospel separately; but the law as established by faith in Christ's righteousness and atonement, and the partaking of his Spirit, is the test of every false system.</body></html>
