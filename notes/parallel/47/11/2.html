There is probably an implied contrast between the true jealousy which thus worked in his soul and the false jealousy of which he speaks in the passage just referred to.<p><span class= "bld">For I have espoused you . . .</span>--The word is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. It appears in this sense in the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-14.htm" title="House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.">Proverbs 19:14</a> : "A man's wife is espoused to him from the Lord." Strictly speaking, it is used of the act of the father who gives his daughter in marriage; and this, rather than the claim to act as "the friend of the bridegroom" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>), is probably the idea here. He claims the office as the "father" of the Corinthian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1Corinthians 4:15</a>). The underlying idea of the comparison is that the Church at large, and every separate portion of it, is as the bride of Christ. On the earlier appearances of this thought, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm" title="The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,">Matthew 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>; and, for its more elaborated forms, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9</a>). What the Apostle now urges is that it is as natural for him to be jealous for the purity of the Church which owes its birth to him, as it is for a father to be jealous over the chastity of the daughter whom he has betrothed as to a kingly bridegroom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.

My jealousy is not the poor earthly vice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-14.htm">Numbers 5:14</a>; Ecclus. 9:1), but a heavenly zeal of love. <span class="cmt_word">For I have espoused you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">betrothed you</span>; at your conversion. I acted as the paranymph, or "bridegroom's friend" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>), in bringing you to Christ, the Bridegroom. The metaphor is found alike in the Old and New Testaments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To one husband</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15</a>).
