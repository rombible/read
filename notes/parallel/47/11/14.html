The thought is rather that Satan is ever so transforming himself. If we are to look for any special allusion, we may find a possible explanation in the words "though we, or an angel from heaven," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm" title="But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:8</a>. They suggest the thought, as at least a probable inference, that the Judaising teachers had claimed the authority of an angelic message for the gospel which they preached, and set this against the authority of the angelic visions which St. Luke had recorded in the case of Cornelius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-2.htm" title="A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.">Acts 10:2</a>). It is probable, we may add, that the Christ-party at Corinth, as distinct from that of Cephas, had affinities with the Jewish sect of the Essenes, and they, we know, were addicted to the worship of angels (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 8, ? 6), and made much of revelations conveyed through their ministry. On this supposition St. Paul may, in his allusive way, mean to imply that they were mistaking a satanic for an angelic apparition. Something of the kind is obviously implied in the stress which St. Paul lays on his own visions and revelations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2Corinthians 12:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even Satan ... angel of light.</span> This is one of Satan's devices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>). The allusion may be to the temptation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8, 9</a>); or to the appearances of Satan with the angels before God in the Book of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>); or perhaps to the Jewish <span class="accented">hagadah</span>, that the "angel" who wrestled with Jacob was in reality Satan. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:5-15 It is far better to be plain in speech, yet walking openly and consistently with the gospel, than to be admired by thousands, and be lifted up in pride, so as to disgrace the gospel by evil tempers and unholy lives. The apostle would not give room for any to accuse him of worldly designs in preaching the gospel, that others who opposed him at Corinth, might not in this respect gain advantage against him. Hypocrisy may be looked for, especially when we consider the great power which Satan, who rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience, has upon the minds of many. And as there are temptations to evil conduct, so there is equal danger on the other side. It serves Satan's purposes as well, to set up good works against the atonement of Christ, and salvation by faith and grace. But the end will discover those who are deceitful workers; their work will end in ruin. Satan will allow his ministers to preach either the law or the gospel separately; but the law as established by faith in Christ's righteousness and atonement, and the partaking of his Spirit, is the test of every false system.</body></html>
