In the term "false apostles" we have the explanation of the "apostles extraordinary" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.">2Corinthians 11:5</a>. These "<span class= "ital">crafty</span> workers" were carrying on a system of imposture, trying to assume the character of being, in a higher sense than he was, "Apostles of Christ." This again throws light both on the words "if any man trusts that he is Christ's" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.">2Corinthians 10:7</a>, and on the "I am of Christ" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For such are false apostles.</span> This, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>, is one of St. Paul's most passionate outbursts of plain speaking. "Now at length" says Bengel, "he calls a spade a spade." They were "false apostles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>), because a true apostle delivers the message of another, while these cared only for self (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Deceitful workers.</span> Workmen who cheat their employers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Transforming themselves.</span> The verb is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>, and does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:5-15 It is far better to be plain in speech, yet walking openly and consistently with the gospel, than to be admired by thousands, and be lifted up in pride, so as to disgrace the gospel by evil tempers and unholy lives. The apostle would not give room for any to accuse him of worldly designs in preaching the gospel, that others who opposed him at Corinth, might not in this respect gain advantage against him. Hypocrisy may be looked for, especially when we consider the great power which Satan, who rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience, has upon the minds of many. And as there are temptations to evil conduct, so there is equal danger on the other side. It serves Satan's purposes as well, to set up good works against the atonement of Christ, and salvation by faith and grace. But the end will discover those who are deceitful workers; their work will end in ruin. Satan will allow his ministers to preach either the law or the gospel separately; but the law as established by faith in Christ's righteousness and atonement, and the partaking of his Spirit, is the test of every false system.</body></html>
