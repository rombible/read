Here that meaning is excluded by the fact that perils of that nature had been already specified, and that he now manifestly speaks of something differing in kind as well as in degree. But there is, as our modern phraseology shows, such a thing as a "rush" of business almost as trying as the "ugly rush" of a crowd, and that is manifestly what he means here. The daily visits of inquirers, the confessions of sin-burdened souls, the craving of perplexed consciences for guidance, the reference of quarrels of the household or the church to his arbitration as umpire, the arrival of messengers from distant churches, each with their tidings of good or evil--this is what we have to think of as present to St. Paul's thoughts as the daily routine of his life; and the absence of any conjunction between the two clauses clearly points to the fact that, in his mind, "the care (or <span class= "ital">anxiety</span>) of all the churches" was all but identical with the "rush" of which he had just spoken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Those things that are without</span>.

It may either mean "trials that come to me from external and extraneous sources (<span class="accented">quae extrinsecus accedunt</span>) or things in addition to these (<span class="accented">praeterea</span>), which I here leave unmentioned." The latter meaning is (as St. Chrysostom saw) almost certainly the correct one. <span class="cmt_word">That which cometh upon me.</span> The word thus rendered is either <span class="accented">episustasis</span> (J, K), which means "hostile attack" or "tumult," as we talk of "a rush of trouble or business;" or <span class="accented">epistasis</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, D, E, F, G), which may imply "halting, lingering thoughts; "attention," and so "anxiety" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-12.htm">Acts 24:12</a>, where there is the same various reading). <span class="cmt_word">Of all the Churches.</span> No doubt he is thinking of his own Churches, the Churches of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.</body></html>
