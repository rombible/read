They were "ministers of Christ" in a nearer and a higher sense than others. This again falls in with all that has been said as to the nature and pretensions of those who said, "I am of Christ." (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.">2Corinthians 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I speak as a fool.</span>--The form of the Greek verb is slightly varied, and means, more emphatically than before, <span class= "ital">I speak as one who is insane; I speak deliriously.</span> In this instance, as before, we must believe that the Apostle is using, in a tone of indignant irony, the very words of insult which had been recklessly flung at him.<p><span class= "bld">In labours . . .</span>--All that follows up to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-28.htm" title="Beside those things that are without, that which comes on me daily, the care of all the churches.">2Corinthians 11:28</a>, inclusive, is a proof of his claim to call himself a minister of Christ. The word "labours" is, of course, too vague to admit of more than a general comparison with the picture of his life presented in the Acts of the Apostles. The more specific statements show us that the writer of that book tends to understate rather than exaggerate the labours and sufferings of the Apostle. It tells us, up to this time, only of one imprisonment, at Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm" title="And when they had laid many stripes on them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:">Acts 16:23</a>), and leaves us to conjecture where and under what circumstances we are to look for the others. In the "deaths oft," we trace an echo of the "sentence of death," the "dying daily" (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead:">2Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10</a>); but the words probably include dangers to life of other kinds as well as those arising from bodily disease.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak as a fool.</span> Not merely as before <span class="accented">aphron</span>, but <span class="accented">paraphronon</span>," I speak as a madman." It is downright insanity on my part to enter into this contest of rival egotism. The verb does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament; the substantive is used of "downright infatuation" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I am more.</span> I may claim to be something beyond an ordinary servant of Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>). This is the "frantic" boast which he proceeds to justify in a fragment of biography which must ever be accounted as the most remarkable and unique in the world's history. And when St. Paul lived the life was, as Dean Stanley says, "hitherto without precedent in the history of the world." No <span class="accented">subsequent</span> life of saint or martyr has ever surpassed St. Paul's, as here sketched, in self-devotion; and no previous life even remotely resembled it. The figure of the Christian missionary was, until then, unknown. <span class="cmt_word">In labours more abundant;</span> literally, <span class="accented">more abundantly</span>. The best comment is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In stripes above measure.</span> The expression is partly explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">In prisons.</span> St. Clement of Rome says that St. Paul was imprisoned seven times. The only imprisonment <span class="accented">up to this date</span> recorded in the Acts is that at Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>). The imprisonments in Jerusalem, Caesarea, and Rome all took place later. He says later," The Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city that bonds and imprisonment await me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In deaths oft.</span> He alludes to the incessant opposition, peril, and anguish which make him say in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>, "I die daily" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-11.htm">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-36.htm">Romans 8:36</a>). With the whole passage we may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4, 5</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.</body></html>
