"Weariness and painfulness" appear first in the Geneva version; <span class= "ital">toil and trouble</span> is, perhaps, the best English equivalent. From the use of the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2Thessalonians 3:8</a>, it probably refers chiefly to St. Paul's daily labour as a tent-maker. The "watchings" indicate the sleepless nights spent in anxiety, or pain, or prayer. "Hunger and thirst" are named as privations incident to his journeys or his labours. "Fastings," as distinguished from these, can hardly mean anything but times of self-chosen abstinence, of which we have at least two instances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2-3</a>, and which would be natural in St. Paul both as a Pharisee (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm" title="Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm" title="I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.">Luke 18:12</a>) and as a disciple of Christ (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.">Matthew 9:15</a>). "Cold and nakedness" seem to speak not only of lonely journeys, thinly clad and thinly shod, on the high passes from Syria into Asia Minor, but also of lodgings without fire, and of threadbare garments. The whole passage reminds us of the narrative given by an old chronicler of the first appearance of the disciples of Francis of Assisi in England, walking with naked and bleeding feet through ice and snow, clothed only with their one friar's cloak, shivering and frost-bitten (Eccleston, <span class= "ital">De Adventu Minorum</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> He obviously contrasts this picture of his sufferings with what the Corinthians knew of the life of his rivals, who, if they were like their brethren of Judaea, walked in long robes, and loved the uppermost places at feasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-6.htm" title="And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,">Matthew 23:6</a>). It had become a Jewish proverb that "the disciples of the wise had a right to a goodly house, a fair wife, and a soft couch" (Ursini. <span class= "ital">Antiqq. Hebr.</span> c. 5, in Ugolini's <span class= "ital">Thesaurus,</span> vol. xxi.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In weariness and painfulness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in toil and travail</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>).

It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.</body></html>
