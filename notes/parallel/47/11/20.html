They reproduced, in their worst form, the vices of the Pharisaism of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-4.htm" title="For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.">Matthew 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore you shall receive the greater damnation.">Matthew 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-25.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.">Matthew 23:25</a>). They enslaved the consciences of men (the same word is used of the same class of men in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>) by pressing on them an iron code of rules which left no room for the free play of conscience and of reason in those over whom they claimed to act as directors.<p><span class= "bld">If a man devour you.</span>--The word again reminds us of our Lord's denunciation of the teachers who "devoured widows' houses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore you shall receive the greater damnation.">Matthew 23:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">If a man take of you . . .</span>--The words in italics are wrongly supplied, and turn this clause into a feeble repetition of the preceding.

We have an earlier instance of its application in the action of Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm" title="But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?">1Kings 22:24</a>). That it had found its way into the Christian Church in the apostolic time is seen in St. Paul's rule that a bishop should be no "striker" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;">1Timothy 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>). It is obvious that he had heard of an instance in which this had actually been done at Corinth, and he taunts them with the tameness of their submission. Did he forget, or had he not as yet heard the law of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm" title="But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.">Matthew 5:39</a>; or was he, knowing it, for a time unmindful of it, in this rush of emotion which he himself feels to be simply human, and therefore not inspired?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage.</span> The verse gives us an unexpected and painful glimpse of the enslaving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>), greed-loving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16.htm">Romans 16</a>;18), gain-hunting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2, 3</a>), domineering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm">3 John 1:9</a>). and even personally violent and insulting character of these teachers; whom yet, strange to say, the Corinthians seem to take at their own estimate, and to tolerate any extreme of insolence from them, while they were jealously suspicious of the disinterested, gentle, and humble apostle. <span class="cmt_word">If a man devour you.</span> As the Pharisees "devoured" widows' houses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Take of you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">seize you</span>; makes you his captives. The verb is the same as "caught you," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Smite you on the face.</span> They must have brought their insolence with them from Jerusalem, where, as we see, not only from the details of our Lord's various mockeries, but from the accounts of the priests in Josephus and the Talmud, the priests made free use of their fists and staves! The fact that so many of the converts were downtrodden slaves and artisans would make them less likely to resent conduct to which they were daily accustomed among the heathen. Neither Greeks nor Orientals felt to anything like the same extent as ourselves the disgrace of a blow. That sense of disgrace rises flora the freedom which Christianity has gradually wrought for us, and the deep sense of the dignity of human nature, which it has inspired Christ had been so smitten, and so was Paul himself long afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>), and he had to teach even Christian bishops that they must be "no strikers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>). The "syllogism of violence" has, alas! been in familiar use among religious teachers in all ages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-25.htm">Nehemiah 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-4.htm">Isaiah 58:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:16-21 It is the duty and practice of Christians to humble themselves, in obedience to the command and example of the Lord; yet prudence must direct in what it is needful to do things which we may do lawfully, even the speaking of what God has wrought for us, and in us, and by us. Doubtless here is reference to facts in which the character of the false apostles had been shown. It is astonishing to see how such men bring their followers into bondage, and how they take from them and insult them.</body></html>
