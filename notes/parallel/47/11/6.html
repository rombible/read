This, then, had also been said of him by some at Corinth. It might seem at first as if the contemptuous criticism was likely to have come from the Hellenic or paganising party of culture, who despised the Apostle because he was without the polish and eloquence of the rhetoric in which they delighted. The context, however, makes it clear that the opponents now under the lash are the Judaising teachers, the "apostles-extraordinary." They apparently affected to despise him because he had abandoned, or had never mastered, the subtleties of Rabbinic casuistry, the wild allegories of Rabbinic interpretation. "He talks," we hear them saying, "of others as 'laymen,' or 'unlearned.' What right has he so to speak who is practically but a 'layman' himself? How can a man who is cutting and stitching all day be a 'doctor of the law'? <span class= "ital">Ne sutor ultra crepidam."</span> Side by side with the recognition of the dignity of labour in some Jewish proverbs (such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as that the father who did not teach his son to work taught him to be a thief), there was among the later Rabbis something like the feeling of an aristocracy of scholarship. Even the Son of Sirach, after describing the work of the ploughman and the carpenter and the potter, excludes them from the higher life of wisdom. "They shall not be sought for in public counsel . . . they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/38-33.htm" title="They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.">Ecclesiasticus 38:33</a>). The word for "rude" was probably used as the equivalent for the Hebrew term by which the Pharisees held up the working classes to contempt as "the people of the earth."<p><span class= "bld">But we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.</span>--The readings vary, some of the better MSS. giving the active form of the verb, <span class= "ital">having made </span>(<span class= "ital">it</span>)<span class= "ital"> manifest in everything among all men.</span> The apparent awkwardness of having a transitive verb without an object probably led to the substitution of the passive participle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rude in speech;</span> literally, <span class="accented">a laic in discourse</span>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-13.htm">1 Corinthians 2:13</a>; and, for the word <span class="accented">idiotes</span>, a private person, and so "one who is untrained," as contrasted with a professor, see the only other places where it occurs in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16, 23, 24</a>). St. Paul did not profess to have the trained oratorical skill of Apollos.

The rendering will then be, <span class="accented">In everything making it</span> (my knowledge) <span class="accented">manifest among all men towards you</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:5-15 It is far better to be plain in speech, yet walking openly and consistently with the gospel, than to be admired by thousands, and be lifted up in pride, so as to disgrace the gospel by evil tempers and unholy lives. The apostle would not give room for any to accuse him of worldly designs in preaching the gospel, that others who opposed him at Corinth, might not in this respect gain advantage against him. Hypocrisy may be looked for, especially when we consider the great power which Satan, who rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience, has upon the minds of many. And as there are temptations to evil conduct, so there is equal danger on the other side. It serves Satan's purposes as well, to set up good works against the atonement of Christ, and salvation by faith and grace. But the end will discover those who are deceitful workers; their work will end in ruin. Satan will allow his ministers to preach either the law or the gospel separately; but the law as established by faith in Christ's righteousness and atonement, and the partaking of his Spirit, is the test of every false system.</body></html>
