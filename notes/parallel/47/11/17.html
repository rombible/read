From one point of view the distinction drawn is the same as that which we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.">1Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a>. There is, however, a marked difference in the subject-matter of the two cases. There he distinguishes a private opinion from a principle or rule which he feels to be divine. Here he draws the line of demarcation between human feelings and a divine inspiration. It is, of course, easy to raise questions which would be hard, if they were not also frivolous and foolish. Are we to class what he places on the lower side of the boundary-line as inspired or uninspired teaching? If the former, are we not contradicting what he writes as inspired? If the latter, are we not depriving what follows of the authority of an inspired writing? Are we not, in so doing, admitting the principle of recognising a human element mingling with the divine in other parts of Scripture as well as this? The answer to these questions, so far as they need an answer, is best found in taking St. Paul's words in their plain and natural sense, believing that his words have just the authority which he claims for them, and no more. Speaking apart from these questions, there is something almost pathetic in the consciousness which he feels that self-vindication can never, as such, come from the Spirit of God, and that it is, at the best, a pardonable human weakness. It is not wrong, or else his conscience would have forbidden it. It is not the note of the highest or noblest temper, or else he would have felt the Spirit's guidance in it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not after the Lord.</span> "Boasting," or what might be stigmatized as such, may become a sort of painful necessity, necessitated by human baseness; but in itself it cannot be "after the Lord." There is nothing Christ-like in it. It is human, not Divine; an earthly necessity, not a heavenly example; a sword of the giant Philistine, which yet David may be forced to use. <span class="cmt_word">Confidence</span>; <span class="accented">hypostasis</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>, where exactly the same phrase occurs. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:16-21 It is the duty and practice of Christians to humble themselves, in obedience to the command and example of the Lord; yet prudence must direct in what it is needful to do things which we may do lawfully, even the speaking of what God has wrought for us, and in us, and by us. Doubtless here is reference to facts in which the character of the false apostles had been shown. It is astonishing to see how such men bring their followers into bondage, and how they take from them and insult them.</body></html>
