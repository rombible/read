If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.">2Corinthians 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.">2Corinthians 10:11</a>, to an individual teacher who had made himself conspicuously prominent. The words throw light on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/1-7.htm" title="Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.">Galatians 1:7-8</a>. The false teachers in Galatia and those at Corinth were doing the same thing. In the absence of fuller knowledge of what they taught, it is difficult to define accurately what precise form of error is alluded to. One thing, at least, is clear--that their Jesus was not his Jesus--not the Friend and Brother of mankind who had died for all men, that He might reconcile them to God. Reasoning from probabilities, we may, perhaps, infer that they spoke of Him as the head of a Jewish kingdom, requiring circumcision and all the ordinances of the Law as a condition of admission to it.<p><span class= "bld">If ye receive another spirit.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a different spirit,</span> as showing that the word is not the same as in the previous clause. The words point, it is clear, to a counterfeit inspiration, perhaps like that of those who had interrupted the praises of the Church with the startling cry, "Anathema to Jesus!" (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1Corinthians 12:3</a>.) Such as these were the "false prophets" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1John 4:3</a>, simulating the phenomena of inspiration, perhaps thought of by the Apostles as really acting under the inspiration of an evil spirit.<p><span class= "bld">Which ye have not received.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">did not receive,</span> as referring definitely to the time of their conversion.<p><span class= "bld">Another gospel, which ye have not accepted.</span>--Better, as before, <span class= "ital">a different gospel, which ye did not accept</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> different from that which you did accept from me. His gospel, he seems to say, was one of pardon through faith working by love: theirs was based on the old Pharisaic lines of works, ritual, ceremonial and moral precepts, standing in their teaching on the same footing.<p><span class= "bld">Ye might well bear with him.</span>--Better, the adverb being emphatic, and intensely ironical, <span class= "ital">nobly would ye bear with him.</span> He means, of course, that they have done much more than tolerate the preachers of the false gospel, and have paid them an extravagant deference. On a like use of irony in our Lord's teaching, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-9.htm" title="And he said to them, Full well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.">Mark 7:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that cometh.</span> Apparently an allusion to some recent and rival teacher. <span class="cmt_word">Another Jesus</span>. The intruder preaches, not a <span class="accented">different</span> Jesus (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) or a different gospel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-8</a>), but ostensibly the same Jesus whom St. Paul had preached. <span class="cmt_word">Another spirit... another gospel;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a different spirit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)... <span class="accented">a different</span> gospel. The Jesus preached was the same; the gospel accepted, the Spirit received, were supposed to remain unaltered. Ye might well bear with him. This is not without a touch of irony. You are all set against me; and yet the newcomer does not profess to preach to you another Jesus, or impart a different Spirit! Had he done so, you might have had some excuse (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) for listening to him. Now there is none; for it was I who first preached Jesus to you, and from me you first received the Spirit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-4 The apostle desired to preserve the Corinthians from being corrupted by the false apostles. There is but one Jesus, one Spirit, and one gospel, to be preached to them, and received by them; and why should any be prejudiced, by the devices of an adversary, against him who first taught them in faith? They should not listen to men, who, without cause, would draw them away from those who were the means of their conversion.</body></html>
