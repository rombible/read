The accuracy of the Apostle in referring to this form of suffering, where we can compare it with the history, may fairly be urged as evidence of a like accuracy in his other statements.<p><span class= "bld">Thrice I suffered shipwreck.</span>--Again we have a picture of unrecorded sufferings, which we must refer either to the period of his life between his departure from Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm" title="Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.">Acts 9:30</a>) and his arrival at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>), or to voyages among the islands of the 'gean Sea during his stay at Corinth or at Ephesus, or to that from Ephesus to Caesarea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a>.<p><span class= "bld">A night and a day I have been in the deep.</span>--Taken in their natural sense the words probably point to one of the shipwrecks just mentioned, in which, either swimming or with the help of a plank (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-44.htm" title="And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.">Acts 27:44</a>), he had kept himself floating for nearly a whole day, beginning with the night. They have, however, been referred by some writers to a dungeon pit, like that into which Jeremiah was cast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm" title="Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), in which the Apostle was either thrown or hid himself after the stoning at Lystra. Bede (<span class= "ital">Qucest.</span> iii. 8) relates, on the authority of Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury--whose evidence, as a native of Tarsus, has here a special interest--that there was such a dungeon known by the name of <span class= "ital">Bythos</span> (the word used here for "deep") in his time at Cyzicus, and, if so, it is probable enough that the same use of the word may have prevailed in other cities. So at Athens there was a dungeon known as the <span class= "ital">barathron</span>--a word used also for a "gulf." On the whole, however, though the conjecture is interesting enough to deserve mention, there seems no adequate reason for adopting it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thrice was I beaten with rods.</span> This alludes to scourgings inflicted by Gentile magistrates with the <span class="accented">vitis</span>, or vine stick, of soldiers, or with the fasces of lictors. Only one of these horrible scourgings, which likewise often ended in death, is narrated in the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22</a>). We do not know when the others were inflicted. In any case they were egregious violations of St. Paul's right of Roman citizenship; but this claim (as we see in Cicero's various orations) was often set at nought in the provinces. <span class="cmt_word">Once was I stoned</span>. At Lystra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thrice I suffered shipwreck.</span> Not one of these shipwrecks is narrated in the Acts. The shipwreck of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, took place some years later. <span class="cmt_word">A night and a day I have been in the deep.</span> An allusion, doubtless, to his escape from one of the shipwrecks by floating for twenty-four hours on a plank in the stormy sea. We have no right to assume that the deliverance was <span class="accented">miraculous</span>. The perfect tense shows St. Paul's vivid reminiscence of this special horror. "In the deep" means "floating on the deep waves." Theophylact explains the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1ff7;</span> to mean "in Bythos," and says that it was a place near Lystra, apparently like the Athenian <span class="accented">Barathrum</span> and the Spartan Caeadas - a place where the bodies of criminals were thrown. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.</body></html>
