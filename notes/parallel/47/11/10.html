He speaks here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a>, in the consciousness that the truth of Christ (the objective sense of the truth revealed in Christ seems almost merged in the subjective sense of the truthfulness that was of the essence of His nature) dwells in him, and that therefore he cannot but speak "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."<p><span class= "bld">No man shall stop me of this boasting.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">This boast shall not be stopped for me.</span> The verb for "stop" means primarily to "hedge round," or "fence." In the New Testament, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm" title="Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.">Romans 3:19</a>, it is always used of "stopping the mouth." Here, with something like a personification, he says that his boast shall not have its mouth thus sealed.<p><span class= "bld">In the region of Achaia.</span>--The word (<span class= "ital">klima</span>) is peculiar to St. Paul among the writers of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm" title="Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;">Galatians 1:21</a>). Like our word "climate," which is derived from it, it was originally a term of science, and had passed gradually into colloquial usage. He names the province and not the city--probably to include Cenchreae. There is no evidence of his having preached in any other locality south of the Isthmus of Corinth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the truth of Christ is in me.</span> The strength of St. Paul's feelings on the subject has already been expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>. We have a similar appeal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1</a>. The "as" is not in the original, but evidently the words are meant for a solemn asseveration - "The truth of Christ is in me, that," etc. <span class="cmt_word">No man shall stop me of this boasting;</span> literally, <span class="accented">this shall not be stopped as concerns me</span>. The verb means literally, "shall be fenced," and with that tendency to over elaboration which is frequent in commentators, some suppose that St. Paul referred to the projected wall across the isthmus of Corinth, etc. But the same word is used for simply stopping the mouth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the regions of Achaia</span>. He would not apply the rule to Corinth only, but seems to have felt the need for the utmost circumspection, and for cutting off every handle for suspicion or slander among these subtle, loquacious, intellectual Greeks. He could act more freely among the more frank and generous Macedonians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:5-15 It is far better to be plain in speech, yet walking openly and consistently with the gospel, than to be admired by thousands, and be lifted up in pride, so as to disgrace the gospel by evil tempers and unholy lives. The apostle would not give room for any to accuse him of worldly designs in preaching the gospel, that others who opposed him at Corinth, might not in this respect gain advantage against him. Hypocrisy may be looked for, especially when we consider the great power which Satan, who rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience, has upon the minds of many. And as there are temptations to evil conduct, so there is equal danger on the other side. It serves Satan's purposes as well, to set up good works against the atonement of Christ, and salvation by faith and grace. But the end will discover those who are deceitful workers; their work will end in ruin. Satan will allow his ministers to preach either the law or the gospel separately; but the law as established by faith in Christ's righteousness and atonement, and the partaking of his Spirit, is the test of every false system.</body></html>
