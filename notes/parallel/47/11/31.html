It is used to preface what was perhaps intended to be a definite sketch of the most perilous incidents and trials of his life, which would have been to us of inestimable value. This awful attestation of his truthfulness was necessary, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because even the very little which we do know shows us that the tale would have been "passing strange;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because his base and shameless calumniators had evidently insinuated that he was not straightforward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>). (On the phrases used, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.</body></html>
