Some of them may be referred to journeys (as above) before his arrival at Antioch; some, probably, to that from Antioch to Ephesus through the interior of Asia Minor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1</a>); some to excursions from Ephesus. The "perils of waters" (better, <span class= "ital">rivers</span>) point to the swollen torrents that rush down in spring from the mountain heights of the Taurus and other ranges, and render the streams unfordable. "Robbers" infested, then as now, well-nigh every high-road in Syria and Asia Minor, as in the parable of the Good Samaritan (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-30.htm" title="And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.">Luke 10:30</a>), and the story of St. John and the young robber, as reported from Clement of Alexandria by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> iii. 23). Of the "perils from his own countrymen," we have instances enough up to this time at Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-23.htm" title="And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:">Acts 9:23</a>), at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-29.htm" title="And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.">Acts 9:29</a>), at Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, and Lystra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/14-5.htm" title="And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them spitefully, and to stone them,">Acts 14:5-19</a>), at Thessalonica, and at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>). Of "perils from the heathen" we find examples at Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm" title="And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,">Acts 16:20</a>) and Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23</a>). City and wilderness (possibly the Arabian desert of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17</a>; possibly the high table-lands of Armenia and Asia Minor) and sea were alike fruitful in dangers. As if with something like a climax he reserves the word "false brethren," such as those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>, as the last and worst of his trials.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In journeyings often.</span> In those days and in those countries journeys were not only perilous and fatiguing, but also accompanied with many severe hardships and discomforts. <span class="cmt_word">In perils of waters;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of rivers</span>.

In the wilderness. As, for instance, in travelling through the wild waste tracts of land between Perga and Antioch in Pisidia, or thence to Lystra and Derbe; or over the mountain chains of Taurus to the cities of Galatia. <span class="cmt_word">In the sea.</span> Storms, leaks, pirates, mutinies, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Among false brethren.</span> The word only occurs elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.</body></html>
