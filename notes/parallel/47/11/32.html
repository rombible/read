There was, we can well imagine, an element of the ludicrous--something that gave occasion to jests and sneers--in the way in which the Apostle's escape On the historical facts connected with this incident, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-24.htm" title="But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.">Acts 9:24-25</a>. The additional details which we learn from St. Paul are--(1) that Damascus was under the immediate control, not of the Governor of Syria, but of a governor or an <span class= "ital">ethnarch;</span> (2) that the ethnarch was appointed, not by the Roman emperor, but by Aretas (the name was hereditary, and was the Greek form of the Arabic <span class= "ital">Haret</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> the King of the Nabathaean Arabs, who had his capital at Petra, who was the father of the first wife of Herod Antipas (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-1.htm" title="At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,">Matthew 14:1</a>); (3) that the ethnarch lent himself to the enmity of the Jews, and stationed troops at each gate of the city to prevent St. Paul's escape. "Ethnarch," it may be noted, was about this time the common title of a subordinate provincial governor. It had been borne by Judas Maccabaeus (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/14-47.htm" title="Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be high priest, and captain and governor of the Jews and priests, and to defend them all.">1 Maccabees 14:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/15-1.htm" title="Moreover Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent letters from the isles of the sea unto Simon the priest and prince of the Jews, and to all the people;">1 Maccabees 15:1-2</a>) and by Archelaus (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> ii. 6, ? 3).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In Damascus.</span> (For the incident referred to, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-22.htm">Acts 9:22-25</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The governor;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the ethnarch</span>. This is obviously the title given to the commandant of the city (whether an Arabian or a Jew), left in charge by Aretas.

He had either seized the city during his war with Herod, to avenge the insult offered to his daughter by Herod's adultery with Herodias; or it may have been assigned to him by Caligula.

It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.</body></html>
