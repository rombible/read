St. Paul either takes for granted that the disciples at Corinth will recognise the "serpent" as the symbol of the great Tempter, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm" title="And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.">Revelation 12:9</a>; or, without laying stress on that identification, simply compares the work of the rival teachers to that of the serpent.
