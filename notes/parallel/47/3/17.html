We apply the term "Lord," it is true, as a predicate of the Holy Spirit when we speak, as in the Nicene Creed, of the Holy Ghost as "the Lord, and Giver of life," or say, as in the pseudo-Athanasian, that "the Holy Ghost is Lord;" but using the term "the Lord" as the subject of a sentence, those who have been trained in the theology of those creeds would hardly say, "The Lord" (the term commonly applied to the Father in the Old Testament, and to the Son in the New) "is the Spirit." We have, accordingly, to remember that St. Paul did not contemplate the precise language of these later formularies. He had spoken, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.">2Corinthians 3:16</a>, of Israel's "turning to the Lord;" he had spoken also of his own work as "the ministration of the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-8.htm" title="How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?">2Corinthians 3:8</a>). To turn to the Lord--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to the Lord Jesus--was to turn to Him whose essential being, as one with the Father, was Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm" title="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.">John 4:24</a>), who was in one sense, <span class= "ital">the</span> Spirit, the life-giving energy, as contrasted with the letter that killeth. So we may note that the attribute of "quickening," which is here specially connected with the name of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6</a>), is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a> connected also with the names of the Father and the Son. The thoughts of the Apostle move in a region in which the Lord Jesus, not less than the Holy Ghost, is contemplated as Spirit. This gives, it is believed, the true sequence of St. Paul's thoughts. The whole verse may be considered as parenthetical, explaining that the "turning to the Lord" coincides with the "ministration of the Spirit." Another interpretation, inverting the terms, and taking the sentence as "the Spirit is the Lord," is tenable grammatically, and was probably adopted by the framers of the expanded form of the Nicene Creed at the Council of Constantinople (A.D. 380). It is obvious, however, that the difficulty of tracing the sequence of thought becomes much greater on this method of interpretation.<p><span class= "bld">Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</span>--The Apostle returns to the more familiar language. To turn to the Lord, who is Spirit, is to turn to <span class= "ital">the</span> Spirit which is His, which dwelt in Him, and which He gives. And he assumes, almost as an axiom of the spiritual life, that the presence of that Spirit gives freedom, as contrasted with the bondage of the letter--freedom from slavish fear, freedom from the guilt and burden of sin, freedom from the tyranny of the Law. Compare the aspect of the same thought in the two Epistles nearly contemporary with this:--the Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God, those children being partakers of a glorious liberty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16-21</a>); the connection between walking in the Spirit and being called to liberty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13-16</a>). The underlying sequence of thought would seem to be something like this: "Israel, after all, with all its seeming greatness and high prerogatives, was in bondage, because it had the letter, not the Spirit; we who have the Spirit can claim our citizenship in the Jerusalem which is above and which is free" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.">Galatians 4:24-31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Lord is that Spirit.</span> The "but" (Authorized Version, "now") introduces an explanation. To whom shall they turn? To the Lord. "But the Lord is the Spirit." The word "spirit" could not be introduced thus abruptly and vaguely; it must refer to something already said, and therefore to the last mention of the word "spirit" in ver. 3. The Lord is the Spirit, who giveth life and freedom, in antithesis to the spirit of death and legal bondage (see ver. 6; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). The best comment on the verse is <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>, "For the law of the <span class="accented">spirit of life in Christ Jesus</span> hath made me free from the law of sin and death." All life and all religion had become to St. Paul a vision of all things in Christ. He has just said that the spirit giveth life, and, after the digression about the moral blindness which prevented the Jews from being emancipated from the bondage of the letter, it was quite natural for him to add, "Now the Lord <span class="accented">is</span> the Spirit to which I alluded." The connection in which the verse stands excludes a host of untenable meanings which have been attached to it. <span class="cmt_word">There is liberty.</span> The liberty of confidence (ver. 4), and of frank speech (ver. 12), and of sonship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>), and of freedom from guilt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>); so that the Law itself, obeyed no longer in the mere letter but also in the spirit, becomes a royal law of liberty, and not a yoke which gendereth to bondage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-12.htm">James 2:12</a>) - a service, indeed, but one which is perfect freedom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to use great plainness, or clearness, of speech. The Old Testament believers had only cloudy and passing glimpses of that glorious Saviour, and unbelievers looked no further than to the outward institution. But the great precepts of the gospel, believe, love, obey, are truths stated as clearly as possible. And the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, is made as plain as human language can make it. Those who lived under the law, had a veil upon their hearts. This veil is taken away by the doctrines of the Bible about Christ. When any person is converted to God, then the veil of ignorance is taken away. The condition of those who enjoy and believe the gospel is happy, for the heart is set at liberty to run the ways of God's commandments. They have light, and with open face they behold the glory of the Lord. Christians should prize and improve these privileges. We should not rest contented without knowing the transforming power of the gospel, by the working of the Spirit, bringing us to seek to be like the temper and tendency of the glorious gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and into union with Him.
