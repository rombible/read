Here, again, we have to read between the lines. Titus has told St. Paul what has been said of him at Corinth. Referring, probably, to what he had said in his First Epistle as to the "wisdom" which he preached (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>), his having "laid the foundation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10</a>), his dwelling on his sufferings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;">1Corinthians 4:11</a>), his preaching without payment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1Corinthians 9:15</a>) as a thing he gloried in, they had sneered at him as always "commending himself." They had added that it was no wonder that he did so when he had no authoritative letters of commendation from other churches, such as were brought by other teachers. As soon as the words "We are not as the many" had passed his lips, the thought occurs that the same will be said again. He <span class= "ital">hears</span> it said, as it were, and makes his answer.<p><span class= "bld">Need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you?</span>--We are left to conjecture who are thus referred to. Possibly some of the Apollos party had contrasted the letters which he had brought from Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-27.htm" title="And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:">Acts 18:27</a>) with St. Paul's want of them. Possibly the Judaising teachers who meet us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2Corinthians 11:13</a> had come with credentials of this nature from the Church of Jerusalem. The indignant tone in which St. Paul speaks indicates the latter view as the more probable. The "letters of commendation" deserve notice as an important element in the organisation of the early Church. A Christian travelling with such a letter from any Church was certain to find a welcome in any other. They guaranteed at once his soundness in the faith and his personal character, and served to give a reality to the belief in the "communion" of saints, as the necessary sequel to the recognition of a Catholic or universal Church. It is significant of the part they had played in the social victory of the Christian Church that Julian tried to introduce them into the decaying system which he sought to galvanise into an imitative life (Sozomen. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> v. 16).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">St</span>. <span class="accented">Paul's ministry is his sufficient letter of commendation</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do we begin again to commend ourselves?</span> The last verse of the last chapter might be seized upon by St. Paul's opponents to renew their charge - that he was always praising himself. He anticipates the malignant and meaning smiles with which they would hear such words. The word "again" implies that this charge had already been brought against him, perhaps in consequence of such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-18.htm">1 Corinthians 14:18</a>, etc. Such passages might be called self-laudatory and egotistical, were it not that (as St. Paul here explains) they arose only from a sense of the grandeur of his office, of which he was the almost involuntary agent, used by God as it seemed best to him. Hence he says later on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7.htm">2 Corinthians 7</a>:18) that self-praise is no commendation, and that the true test of a man is God's commendation. The verb "I commend," technically used in the same sense as our "commendatory letters," occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Or need we,</span> etc.? The reading, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, thus translated, is better supported than <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, unless, which would have a somewhat ironical force. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the reading <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> implies, "Can you possibly think that we need," etc.? Generally, when a stranger came to some Church to which he was not personally known, he carried with him some credentials in the form of letters from accredited authorities. St. Paul treats it as absurd to suppose that he or Timothy should need such letters, either <span class="accented">from</span> the Corinthians or to them. <span class="cmt_word">As some</span>. He will not name them, but he refers to the Judaists, who vaunted of their credentials in order to disparage St. Paul, who was too great to need and too independent to use them. We can hardly, perhaps, realize the depth and bitterness of antagonism concealed under that word "some" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>. It is not meant that there was anything discreditable in using such letters (for Apollos had used them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>), but the disgraceful thing was that St. Paul should be disparaged for not bringing them. <span class="cmt_word">Epistles of commendation.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "introductory letters" - was familiar in later Greek. In days when there were few public hostels, and when it was both a duty and a necessity for small and persecuted communities like those of the Jews and Christians to practise hospitality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>. etc.), it was customary both for synagogues and Churches to provide their friends and emissaries with authentic testimonials. Otherwise they might have been deceived by wandering impostors, as, in fact, the Christians were deceived by the vagabond quack Peregrinus. We can easily see how the custom of using such letters might be abused by idle, restless, and intriguing persons, who have never found it very difficult to procure them. We find traces of their <span class="accented">honest</span> use by Phoebe, by Silas and Jude, by Apollos, by Mark, and by Zenas, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; and of their unfair use by certain Judaists, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> and Galatians 2:12. Nothing can more forcibly illustrate the necessity for St. Paul's protest against the idle vaunt of possessing such letters, than the fact that, <span class="accented">more than a century afterwards</span>, we find malignant innuendoes aimed at St. Paul in the pseudo-Clementines, under the name of" the enemy" and "Simon Magus" and "a deceiver." He is there spoken of as using letters from the high priest (which, indeed, St. Paul had done as Saul of Tarsus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1, 2</a>); and the Churches are warned never to receive any one who cannot bring credentials from James; so deep-rooted among the Judaists was the antagonism to the independent apostolate and daring originality of the apostle of the Gentiles! Dr. Plumptre quotes Sozomen ('H.E.', 5:16) for the curious fact that the Emperor Julian tried to introduce the system of "commendatory letters" into his revived paganism. <span class="cmt_word">Or letters of commendation from you.</span> The substitution of "letters" for "epistles" is an instance of the almost childish fondness for unnecessary synonyms, which is one of the defects of the Authorized Version. The true reading probably is "to you or from you" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C). The word "commendatory" (<span class="accented">sustatikon</span>) is omitted in A, B, C. <span class="accented">Or from you</span>. It was worse than absurd to suppose that St. Paul should need those <span class="accented">literae formatae</span> to a Church of which he was the thunder; and nothing but the boundless "inflation" which characterized the Corinthians could have led them to imagine that he needed letters <span class="accented">from</span> them to other Churches, as though, forsooth, they were the primary Church or the only church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-36.htm">1 Corinthians 14:36</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.</body></html>
