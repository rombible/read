(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm" title="But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:">2Corinthians 3:7</a>.) What was the object of this putting on of the veil? The English version of that text suggests that it was to hide the brightness from which they shrank. But the interpretation which St. Paul follows presents a very different view. Moses put the veil over his face that <span class= "ital">they might not see the end, the fading away</span> of that transitory glory. For them it was as though it were permanent and unfading. They did not see--this is St. Paul's way of allegorising the fact stated--that the whole system of the Law, as symbolised by that brightness, had but a fugitive and temporary being.<p><span class= "bld">Could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">look on the end of that which was perishing.</span> Literally, the words state the fact, they could not see how the perishing glory ended. In the interpretation of the parable St. Paul seems to say that what was true of those older Israelites was true also of their descendants. They could not see the true end of the perishing system of the Law, its aim, purport, consummation. There is, perhaps, though most recent commentators have refused to recognise it, a half-allusive reference to the thought expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>, that "Christ is the <span class= "ital">end</span> of the law for righteousness;" or, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1Timothy 1:5</a>, that "the <span class= "ital">end</span> of the commandment is love out of a pure heart." Had their eyes been open, they would have seen in the fading away of the old glory of the decaying "letter" the dawn of a glory that excelled it. And in the thought that this was the true "end" of the Law we find the ground for the Apostle's assertion that he used great plainness of speech. He had no need to veil his face or his meaning, for he had no fear lest the glory of the gospel of which he was a minister should fade away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And not as Moses.</span> We need not act, as Moses was obliged to do, by putting any veil upon our faces while we speak. And here the image of "the veil" as completely seizes St. Paul's imagination as the image of the letter does in the first verses. <span class="cmt_word">Put a veil;</span> literally, <span class="accented">was putting</span>, or, <span class="accented">used to put</span>, a veil on his face when he had finished speaking to the people. <span class="cmt_word">That the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that the children of Israel might not gaze on the end of what was passing away</span>. The object of the veil, according to St. Paul, was to prevent the Israelites from gazing on <span class="accented">the last gleam of the covenant</span>. In other words, he did not wish them to be witnesses of a <span class="accented">fading</span> glory. It is preposterous to imagine that St. Paul is here casting any blame on the conduct of Moses, as though he acted fraudulently or delusively. Moses was aware, and even told the people, float his legislation was not final (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15 -19</a>), but it would be quite natural that he should not wish the people to witness the gradual dimming of the lustre which, in St. Paul's view, was typical of that transitoriness. It seems, however, that St. Paul is here either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> following a different reading or rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33</a>; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> is adopting some Jewish <span class="accented">hagadah</span>; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is giving his own turn to the narrative, as the rabbis habitually did, by way of <span class="accented">midrash</span>, or exposition. For from the narrative of Exodus we should not gather that it was the object of Moses to hide the disappearance of the splendour, but rather to render the light endurable. In our Authorized Version the verse runs, "till Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face;" but the meaning of the original may be, "after he had done speaking with them," as the LXX. takes it and the Vulgate. <span class="accented">The end</span>. To interpret this of <span class="accented">Christ</span>, because of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>, is an instance of the superstitious and unintelligent way in which systems are made out of a mosaic of broken texts. The foolish character of the interpretation is shown when we consider that it involves the inference that Moses put a veil on his face in order to prevent the Israelites from seeing Christi But this attempt to illustrate Scripture by catching at a similar, expression applied in a wholly different way in another part of Scripture, is one of the normal follies of scriptural interpretation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to use great plainness, or clearness, of speech. The Old Testament believers had only cloudy and passing glimpses of that glorious Saviour, and unbelievers looked no further than to the outward institution. But the great precepts of the gospel, believe, love, obey, are truths stated as clearly as possible. And the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, is made as plain as human language can make it. Those who lived under the law, had a veil upon their hearts. This veil is taken away by the doctrines of the Bible about Christ. When any person is converted to God, then the veil of ignorance is taken away. The condition of those who enjoy and believe the gospel is happy, for the heart is set at liberty to run the ways of God's commandments. They have light, and with open face they behold the glory of the Lord. Christians should prize and improve these privileges. We should not rest contented without knowing the transforming power of the gospel, by the working of the Spirit, bringing us to seek to be like the temper and tendency of the glorious gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and into union with Him. We behold Christ, as in the glass of his word; and as the reflection from a mirror causes the face to shine, the faces of Christians shine also.</body></html>
