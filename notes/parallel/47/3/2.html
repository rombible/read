They, the Corinthian converts, are written on his heart. In his thoughts and prayers for them he finds his true commendatory letter, and this a letter which is patent to the eyes of all men. In "known and read" we find the familiar play on the two words, <span class= "ital">epiginoskein</span> and <span class= "ital">anaginoskein.</span> (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-13.htm" title="For we write none other things to you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;">2Corinthians 1:13</a>.) All who knew St. Paul could read what was there written.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are our epistle.</span> Their very existence as a Church was the most absolute "commendatory letter" of St. Paul, both <span class="accented">from</span> them and <span class="accented">to</span> them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm">1 Corinthians 9:2</a>, "The seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord "). <span class="cmt_word">Written in our hearts.</span> The expression has no connection with the fact that the high priest bore the names of Israel graven on the jewelled Urim, which he wore upon his breast. St. Paul means that others may bring their "letters of commendation" in their hands. <span class="accented">His</span> letter of commendation is the very name and existence of the Church of Corinth written on his heart. <span class="cmt_word">Known and read of all men.</span> The metaphor is subordinated to the <span class="accented">fact</span>. All men may recognize the autograph, and in it were read the history of the Corinthian converts, which was written on the apostle's heart, and which therefore rendered the notion of any other letter of commendation to or from them superfluous and even absurd. The play on words (<span class="accented">epigignosko</span> and <span class="accented">anagignosko</span>) is similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-13.htm">2 Corinthians 1:13</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.</body></html>
