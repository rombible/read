And who is sufficient for these things?">2Corinthians 2:16</a>, in the English as in the Greek, <span class= "ital">sufficient ministers.</span> The noun is used as carrying out the thought implied in the "ministered by us" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2Corinthians 3:3</a>. In the "new covenant"--new, as implying <span class= "ital">freshness</span> of life and energy--we have a direct reference, both to our Lord's words, as cited in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.">1Corinthians 11:25</a>, and given in the Gospel narrative of the Last Supper (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>), and to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>. The Greek omits the article before all three words, "of a new covenant, one not of a written letter, but of spirit." The idea of "spirit" comes from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-26.htm" title="A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span>--The word "letter" (<span class= "ital">gramma</span>) stands, not for what we call the literal meaning of Scripture, as contrasted with one which is allegorical or spiritual, but for the whole written code or law of Judaism. St. Paul does not contrast the literal meaning of that code with the so-called mystical exposition of it (a view which has often led to wild and fantastic interpretations), but speaks of the written code as such. So the plural "the writings, the Scriptures" (<span class= "ital">grammata</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> are used of the sacred Books of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-47.htm" title="But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?">John 5:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 3:15</a>), and the scribes (<span class= "ital">grammateis</span>) were those who interpreted the writings. The contrast between the "letter" in this sense and the "spirit" is a familiar thought with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-27.htm" title="And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?">Romans 2:27-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>). Of this written code St. Paul says that it "killeth." The statement seems startlingly bold, and he does not here stop to explain its meaning. What he means is, however, stated with sufficient fulness in the three Epistles written about this time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm" title="The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.">1Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm" title="For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.">Galatians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-9.htm" title="For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.">Romans 7:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-2.htm" title="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.">Romans 8:2-3</a>, the references being given in the chronological order of the Epistles). The work of the Law, from St. Paul's view, is to make men conscious of sin. No outward command, even though it come from God, and is "holy, and just, and good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>), can, as such, do more than that. What was wanting was the life-giving power of the Spirit. The word here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm" title="And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?">Romans 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>) appears to hover between the sense of "spirit" as representing any manifestation of the Divine Life that gives life--in which sense the words of Christ are "spirit and life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>), and Christ Himself is a "quickening spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1Corinthians 15:45</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2Corinthians 3:17</a> of this chapter)--and the more distinctly personal sense in which St. Paul speaks of "the Spirit," the Holy Spirit, and to which we commonly limit our use of the name of "the Holy Ghost" in His relation to the Father and Son. Of that Spirit St. Paul says that "it quickens:" it can rouse into life not only the slumbering conscience, as the Law had done, but the higher spiritual element in man--can give it strength to will, the healthy energy of new affections, new prayers, new impulses. If we cannot suppose St. Paul to have been acquainted with our Lord's teaching, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a> (where see Note), the coincidence of thought is, at any rate, singularly striking.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who also.</span> Either, "And he it is who;" or, "Who besides <span class="accented">this</span> power, has made us adequate ministers." <span class="cmt_word">Hath made us able ministers;</span> rather, <span class="accented">made us sufficient ministers</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Of the new testament;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of a fresh covenant</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>). The "new testament" has not the remotest connection with what we call "The New Testament," meaning thereby the book - which, indeed, had at this time no existence. The word "testament" means a will, and in this sense implies neither the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span> nor the Greek <span class="accented">diatheke</span>, both of which mean "covenant." In one passage only of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-16.htm">Hebrews 9:16, 17</a>) does <span class="accented">diatheke</span> mean a "testament" or "will." For the thought, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11, 12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Not of the letter, but of the spirit.</span> In other words, "not of the Law, but of the gospel;" not of that which is dead, but of that which is living; not of that which is deathful, but of that which is life-giving; not of bondage, but of freedom; not of mutilation, but of self-control; not of the outward, but of the inward; not of works, but of grace; not of menace, but of promise; not of curse, but of blessing; not of wrath, but of love; not of Moses, but of Christ. This is the theme which St. Paul develops especially in the Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">Not of the letter</span>. Not, that is, of the Mosaic Law regarded as a yoke of externalism; a hard and unhelpful "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not;" a system that possessed no life of its own and inspired no life into others; a "categoric imperative," majestic, indeed, but unsympathetic and pitiless. Both the Law and the gospel were <span class="accented">committed to writing</span>; each covenant had its own <span class="accented">book</span>; but in the case of the Mosaic Law there was the book and nothing more; in the case of the gospel the book was nothing compared to the spirit, and nothing without the spirit. <span class="accented">Out of the spirit</span>. That is, of the gospel which found its pledge and consummation in the gift of the Spirit. The Law, too, was in one sense "spiritual" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>), for it was given by God, who is a Spirit, and it was a holy Law; but though such in itself (<span class="accented">in se</span>) it was relatively (<span class="accented">per aceidens</span>) a cause of sin and death, because it was addressed to a fallen nature, and inspired no spirit by which that nature could be delivered (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-25</a>). But in the gospel the spirit is everything; the mere letter is as nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span> This is one of the very numerous "texts" which have been first misinterpreted and have then been made, for whole centuries, the bases of erroneous systems. On this text more than any other, Origen, followed by the exegetes of a thousand years, built his dogma that the Scripture must be interpreted allegorically, not literally, because "the letter" of the Bible kills. The misinterpretation is extravagantly inexcusable, and, like many others, arose solely from rending words away from their context and so reading new senses into them. The contrast is not between "the outward" and the inward sense of Scripture at all. "The letter" refers exclusively to "the Law," and therefore has so little reference to "the Bible" that it was written before most of the New Testament existed, and only touches on a small portion of the Old Testament. <span class="accented">Killeth</span>. Two questions arise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">What</span> and <span class="accented">whom</span> does it <span class="accented">kill?</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">how</span> does it <span class="accented">kill?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The answers seem to be that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the letter - the Law regarded as an outward letter - passes the sentence of <span class="accented">death on those who disobey it</span>. It says, "He who doeth these things shall live in them;" and therefore implies, as well as often says, that he who disobeys them shall be cut off. It is, therefore, a deathful menace. For none <span class="accented">can</span> obey this Law with perfect obedience. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sting of death being sin, the Law kills by directly leading to sin, in that it stirs into existence the principle of concupiscence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10, 21</a>). <span class="accented">But the spirit giveth life</span>. This contrast between a dead and a living covenant is fundamental, and especially in the writings of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-8.htm">Galatians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). The Law stones the adulteress; the gospel says to her, "Go, and sin no more." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.</body></html>
