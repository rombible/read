Moses removed the veil when he went into the tabernacle to commune with the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-35.htm" title="And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.">Exodus 34:35</a>); so, in the interpretation of the parable, the veil shall be taken away when the heart of Israel shall turn, in the might of a real conversion, to the Lord of Israel. The very word for "turn" is taken from the same context: "Moses called them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation <span class= "ital">turned</span> to him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-31.htm" title="And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him: and Moses talked with them.">Exodus 34:31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When it shall turn to the Lord.</span> The nominative of the verb is not expressed. Obviously the most natural word to supply is the one last alluded to, namely, "the heart of Israel." The verb may have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-31.htm">Exodus 34:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be taken away;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is in course of removal</span>. The tenses imply that "the moment the heart of Israel shall have turned to the Lord, the removal of the veil begins." Then "they shall look on him whom they pierced" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>); "He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to use great plainness, or clearness, of speech. The Old Testament believers had only cloudy and passing glimpses of that glorious Saviour, and unbelievers looked no further than to the outward institution. But the great precepts of the gospel, believe, love, obey, are truths stated as clearly as possible. And the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, is made as plain as human language can make it. Those who lived under the law, had a veil upon their hearts. This veil is taken away by the doctrines of the Bible about Christ. When any person is converted to God, then the veil of ignorance is taken away. The condition of those who enjoy and believe the gospel is happy, for the heart is set at liberty to run the ways of God's commandments. They have light, and with open face they behold the glory of the Lord. Christians should prize and improve these privileges. We should not rest contented without knowing the transforming power of the gospel, by the working of the Spirit, bringing us to seek to be like the temper and tendency of the glorious gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and into union with Him. We behold Christ, as in the glass of his word; and as the reflection from a mirror causes the face to shine, the faces of Christians shine also.</body></html>
