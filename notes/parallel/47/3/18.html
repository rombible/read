"We," says the Apostle, after the parenthesis of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2Corinthians 3:17</a>, "are free, and therefore we have no need to cover our faces, as slaves do before the presence of a great king. There is no veil over our hearts, and therefore none over the eyes with which we exercise our faculty of spiritual vision. We are as Moses was when he stood before the Lord with the veil withdrawn." If the <span class= "ital">Tallith</span> were in use at this time in the synagogues of the Jews, there might also be a reference to the contrast between that ceremonial usage and the practice of Christian assemblies. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7</a>; but see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2Corinthians 3:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord.</span>--The Greek participle which answers to the first five words belongs to a verb derived from the Greek for "mirror" (identical in meaning, though not in form, with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>). The word is not a common word, and St. Paul obviously had some special reason for choosing it, instead of the more familiar words, "seeing," "beholding," "gazing stedfastly;" and it is accordingly important to ascertain its meaning. There is no doubt that the active voice signifies to "make a reflection in a mirror." There is as little doubt that the middle voice signifies to look at one's self in a mirror. Thus Socrates advised drunkards and the young to "look at themselves in a mirror," that they might learn the disturbing effects of passion (<span class= "ital">Diog. Laert.</span> ii. 33; iii. 39). This meaning, however, is inapplicable here; and the writings of Philo, who in one passage (<span class= "ital">de Migr. Abrah.</span> p. 403) uses it in this sense of the priests who saw their faces in the polished brass of the lavers of purification, supply an instance of its use with a more appropriate meaning. Paraphrasing the prayer of Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a>, he makes him say: "Let me not <span class= "ital">behold</span> Thy form (<span class= "ital">idea</span>)<span class= "ital"> mirrored</span> (using the very word which we find here) in any created thing, but in Thee, the very God" (2 <span class= "ital">Allegor.</span> p. 79). And this is obviously the force of the word here. The sequence of thought is, it is believed, this:--St. Paul was about to contrast the veiled vision of Israel with the unveiled gaze of the disciples of Christ; but he remembers what he had said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a> as to the limitation of our present knowledge, and therefore, instead of using the more common word, which would convey the thought of a fuller knowledge, falls back upon the unusual word, which exactly expresses the same thought as that passage had expressed. "We behold the glory of the Lord, of the Jehovah of the Old Testament, but it is not, as yet, face to face, but as mirrored in the person of Christ." The following words, however, show that the word suggested yet another thought to him. When we see the sun as reflected in a polished mirror of brass or silver, the light illumines us: we are, as it were, transfigured by it and reflect its brightness. That this meaning lies in the word itself cannot, it is true, be proved, and it is, perhaps, hardly compatible with the other meaning which we have assigned to it; but it is perfectly conceivable that the word should suggest the fact, and the fact be looked on as a parable.<p><span class= "bld">Are changed into the same image.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">are being transfigured into the same image.</span> The verb is the same (<span class= "ital">metemorphothe</span>) as that used in the account of our Lord's transfiguration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm" title="And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.">Matthew 17:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-2.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and leads them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.">Mark 9:2</a>; and it may be noted that it is used of the transformation (a <span class= "ital">metamorphosis</span> more wondrous than any poet had dreamt of) of the Christian into the likeness of Christ in the nearly contemporary passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>). The thought is identical with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a> : "Conformed to the likeness" (or <span class= "ital">image</span>) "of His Son." We see God mirrored in Christ, who is "the image of the invisible God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>), and as we gaze, with our face unveiled, on that mirror, a change comes over us. The image of the old evil Adam-nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-49.htm" title="And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.">1Corinthians 15:49</a>) becomes less distinct, and the image of the new man, after the likeness of Christ, takes its place. We "faintly give back what we adore," and man, in his measure and degree, becomes, as he was meant to be at his creation, like Christ, "the image of the invisible God." Human thought has, we may well believe, never pictured what in simple phrase we describe as growth in grace, the stages of progressive sanctification, in the language of a nobler poetry.<p><span class= "bld">From glory to glory.</span>--This mode of expressing completeness is characteristic of St. Paul, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, "from faith to faith "; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm" title="To the one we are the smell of death to death; and to the other the smell of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?">2Corinthians 2:16</a>, "of death to death." The thought conveyed is less that of passing from one stage of glory to another than the idea that this transfiguring process, which begins with glory, will find its consummation also in glory. The glory hereafter will be the crown of the glory here. The beatific vision will be possible only for those who have been thus transfigured. "We know that we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1John 3:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</span>--The Greek presents the words in a form which admits of three possible renderings. (1) That of the English version; (2) that in the margin, "as of the Lord the Spirit"; (3) as of the Lord <span class= "ital">of</span> the Spirit. The exceptional order in which the two words stand, which must be thought as adopted with a purpose, is in favour of (2) and (3) rather than of (1), and the fact that the writer had just dictated the words "the Lord is the Spirit" in favour of (2) rather than (3). The form of speech is encompassed with the same difficulties as before, but the leading thought is clear: "The process of transformation originates with the Lord (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> with Christ), but it is with Him, not 'after the flesh' as a mere teacher and prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-16.htm" title="Why from now on know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now from now on know we him no more.">2Corinthians 5:16</a>), not as the mere giver of another code of ethics, another 'letter' or writing, but as a spiritual power and presence, working upon our spirits. In the more technical language of developed theology, it is through the Holy Spirit that the Lord, the Christ, makes His presence manifest to our human spirit." (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-22.htm" title="Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?">John 14:22-26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But we all.</span> An appeal to personal experience in evidence of the freedom. <span class="cmt_word">With open face;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with unveiled face</span>; as Moses himself spoke with God, whereas the Jews could not see even the <span class="accented">reflected</span> splendour on the face of Moses till he had shrouded it with a veil. <span class="cmt_word">Beholding as in a glass.</span> This is <span class="accented">at least</span> as likely to be the true meaning as "reflecting as a mirror," which the Revised Version (following Chrysostom and others) has substituted for it. No other instance occurs in which the verb in the middle voice has the meaning of "reflecting," and the words, "With unveiled face," imply the image of "beholding." They are, in fact, a description of "the beatific vision." An additional reason for retaining the translation of our Authorized Version is that the verb is used in <span class="accented">this</span> sense by Philo ('Leg. Alleg.,' 3:33). <span class="cmt_word">The glory of the Lord.</span> Namely, him who is "the Effulgence of God's glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), the true Shechinah, "the Image of the invisible God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are changed into the same image.</span> The present tense implies a <span class="accented">gradual</span> transfiguration, a mystical and spiritual change which is produced in us while we contemplate Christ. <span class="cmt_word">From glory to glory.</span> Our spiritual assimilation to Christ comes <span class="accented">from</span> his glory and issues in a glory like his (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; comp." from strength to strength," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>). (For the thought, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>.) As by the Spirit of the Lord. This rendering (which is that of the Vulgate also) can hardly be correct. The natural meaning of the Greek is "as <span class="accented">by the</span> [or, <span class="accented">from</span>] <span class="accented">the Lord the Spirit</span>." <span class="accented">Our</span> change into glory comes from the Lord, who, as St. Paul has already explained, is the Spirit of which he has been speaking. No such abstract theological thought is here in his mind as that of the "<span class="accented">hypostatic</span> union," of the Son and the Holy Spirit. He is still referring to the contrast between the letter and the spirit, and his identification of this "spirit" in its highest sense with the quickening life which, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, we receive from Christ, and which is indeed identical with "the Spirit of Christ." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to use great plainness, or clearness, of speech. The Old Testament believers had only cloudy and passing glimpses of that glorious Saviour, and unbelievers looked no further than to the outward institution. But the great precepts of the gospel, believe, love, obey, are truths stated as clearly as possible. And the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, is made as plain as human language can make it. Those who lived under the law, had a veil upon their hearts. This veil is taken away by the doctrines of the Bible about Christ. When any person is converted to God, then the veil of ignorance is taken away. The condition of those who enjoy and believe the gospel is happy, for the heart is set at liberty to run the ways of God's commandments. They have light, and with open face they behold the glory of the Lord. Christians should prize and improve these privileges. We should not rest contented without knowing the transforming power of the gospel, by the working of the Spirit, bringing us to seek to be like the temper and tendency of the glorious gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and into union with Him. We behold Christ, as in the glass of his word; and as the reflection from a mirror causes the face to shine, the faces of Christians shine also.</body></html>
