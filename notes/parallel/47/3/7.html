For "was glorious," more accurately, <span class= "ital">came into being with glory.</span> The thoughts of the Apostle have travelled to the record of the circumstances connected with the giving of the Law as the foundation of the first covenant, and of them he proceeds to speak fully. We can almost picture him to ourselves as taking up his LXX. version of the Law, and reproducing its very words and thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">So that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold . . .</span>--The narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29-35</a> records that when Moses came down from the mount with the second tables of stone, "the skin of his face shone," and the "people were afraid to draw nigh unto him." The English version--that "<span class= "ital">till</span> Moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his face," and that "when he went in before the Lord he took it off until he came out"--suggests the thought that he appeared to the people, after the first manifestation of the unconscious glory, as a veiled prophet. It is doubtful, however, whether this is the natural meaning of the Hebrew, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-35.htm" title="And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.">Exodus 34:35</a> repeats the statement that the Israelites saw the glory. The LXX., Vulgate, and most modern versions give, "When he ceased speaking he put a veil on his face." They saw the brightness, they shrank from it in awe, they were not allowed to watch it to the end and gaze on its disappearance. This was the sequence of facts that St. Paul had in his thoughts, and which he certainly found in the LXX.; and it is of this, accordingly, that he speaks. The children of Israel could not bear to look on the glory, even though it was perishing and evanescent. The English rendering, "which glory was to be done away," reads into the participle a gerundial force that does not properly belong to it; and it may be noted that it is the first of the great English versions that does so, the others giving, "which is made void," or "which is done away." It would be better expressed, perhaps, by, <span class= "ital">which was in the act of passing away.</span> The Greek word is the same as that on which our translators have rung so many changes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1Corinthians 13:8-11</a>. It was a favourite word with St. Paul at this period of his life, occurring twenty-two times in 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans, and three times only in his other Epistles.<p>It may be noted that the Vulgate rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29</a>, "<span class= "ital">ignorabat quod cornuta esset facies ejus</span>" (<span class= "ital">"</span>he knew not that his face was horned"), has given rise to the representations of Moses with horns, or rays of light taking the place of horns, as in Michael Angelo's statue in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli at Rome, and pictorial representations generally.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ministration of death.</span> The ministration, that is, of the Law, of "the letter which killeth." St. Paul here begins one of the arguments <span class="accented">a minori ad majus</span> which are the very basis of the Epistle to the Hebrews. <span class="cmt_word">Written and engraven in stones;</span> literally, <span class="accented">engraved in letters on stones</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). The reference shows that, in speaking of "the letter," St. Paul was only thinking of the Mosaic Law, and indeed specifically of the Decalogue. <span class="cmt_word">Was glorious;</span> literally, <span class="accented">occurred in glory</span>, or, <span class="accented">proved itself glorious</span>. In itself the Law was "holy, just, and good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), and given "at the disposition of angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>); and its transitory glory was illustrated by the lustre which the face of Moses caught by reflection from his intercourse with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>). St. Paul has been led quite incidentally into this digression in the course of defending himself by describing the nature of his ministry; but it bore very definitely on his general purpose, because his chief opponents were Judaists, whose one aim it was to bind upon the Church the yoke of Mosaism. That they could not "behold" the face of Moses is the <span class="accented">hagadah</span>, or traditional legend, derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a>, which says that "they were afraid to <span class="accented">draw nigh</span> to him. The reader may recall the beautiful lines of Cardinal Newman- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Lord l grant me this abiding grace -<br />Thy words and saints to know;<br />To pierce the veil on Moses' face,<br />Although his words be slow."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Because of the glory of his countenance.</span> This circumstance is so often alluded to as to have become identified with the conception of Moses. The Hebrew words for "a ray of light" and "a horn" are identical; hence, instead of saying that his face was "irradiated," the Vulgate says, <span class="accented">Cornnta erat ejus facies</span>; and even in our version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a> we find "And he had <span class="accented">horns</span> [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. 'rays of light'] coming out of his hand." To this is due the mediaeval symbol of Moses with horns, as in the matchless statue by Michael Angelo. <span class="cmt_word">Which glory was to be done away.</span> The Greek might be expressed by "the glory - the evanescing glory - of his countenance." It was not "to <span class="accented">be</span> done away," but from the first moment they saw it it began to vanish. The verb "to do away," implying annulment, and the being abrogated as invalid, is a characteristic word in this group cf Epistles, in which it occurs twenty-two times. This illustrates the prominence in St. Paul's thoughts of the fact that the Law was now "antiquated" and "near its obliteration" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). But in dwelling on the brief and transient character of this radiance, St. Paul seizes on a point which (naturally) is not dwelt upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34.htm">Exodus 34</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.</body></html>
