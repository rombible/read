It is not only as written in his heart, but as seen and known by others, that they (the Corinthians) are as a letter of commendation. They are as a letter which Christ had written as with the finger of God. That letter, he adds, was "ministered by us." He had been, that is, as the <span class= "ital">amanuensis</span> of that letter, but Christ was the real writer.<p><span class= "bld">Written not with ink.</span>--Letters were usually written on papyrus, with a reed pen and with a black pigment (<span class= "ital">atramentum</span>) used as ink. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-12.htm" title="Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.">2John 1:12</a>.) In contrast with this process, he speaks of the Epistle of Christ as written with the "Spirit of the living God." It is noteworthy that the Spirit takes here the place of the older "finger of God" in the history of the two tables of stone in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>. So a like substitution is found in comparing "If I with the finger of God cast out devils," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-20.htm" title="But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.">Luke 11:20</a>, with "If I by the Spirit of God," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>. Traces of the same thought are found in the hymn in the Ordination service, in which the Holy Spirit is addressed as "the finger of God's hand."<p><span class= "bld">Not in tables of stone.</span>--The thought of a letter written in the heart by the Spirit of God brings three memorable passages to St. Paul's memory:--(1) the "heart of flesh" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-26.htm" title="A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>; (2) the promise that the law should be written in the heart, which was to be the special characteristic of the new covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>); and (3) the whole history of the circumstances of the first, or older, covenant; and, from this verse to the end of the chapter, thought follows rapidly on thought in manifold application of the images thus suggested.<p><span class= "bld">But in fleshy tables of the heart.</span>--The better MSS. give <span class= "ital">in tables</span> (or, <span class= "ital">tablets</span>)<span class= "ital">, which are hearts of flesh,</span> reproducing the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:">Ezekiel 11:19</a>. The thought of the letter begins to disappear, and that of a law written on tablets takes its place, as one picture succeeds another in a dissolving view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Manifestly declared.</span> The fame and centrality of Corinth gave peculiar prominence to the fact of their conversion. <span class="cmt_word">The epistle of Christ ministered by us.</span> The Corinthians are the epistle; it is written on the hearts of St. Paul and his companions; Christ was its Composer; they were its amanuenses and its conveyers. The development of the metaphor <span class="accented">as a metaphor</span> would be somewhat clumsy and intricate, but St. Paul only cares to shadow forth the essential fact which he wishes them to recognize. Not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not with visible or perishable materials, but spiritual in its origin and character. The notion of "the finger of God" naturally recalled the notion of "the Spirit of God" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>). Not in tables of stone. God's writing by means of the Spirit on the heart reminds him of another writing <span class="accented">of God</span> on the stone tablets of the Law, which he therefore introduces with no special regard to the congruity of the metaphor about "an epistle." <span class="cmt_word">But in fleshy tables of the heart.</span> The overwhelming preponderance of manuscript authority supports the reading "but in fleshen tablets - hearts." St. Paul is thinking of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, "I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>, "I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh." The tablets were not hard and fragile, but susceptible and receptive. Our letters of introduction are inward not outward, spiritual not material, permanent not perishable, legible to all not only by a few, written by Christ not by man. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.</body></html>
