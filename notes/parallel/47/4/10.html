He was, as it were, dragging about with him what it was scarcely an exaggeration to call a "living corpse;" and this he describes as "the dying" (or <span class= "ital">death-state</span>) "of the Lord Jesus." The thought implied in these words is not formally defined. What seems implied is that it brought him nearer to the likeness of the Crucified; he was thus made a sharer in the sufferings of Christ, filling up what was lacking in the measure of those sufferings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>), dying as He died, crucified with Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>). It may be noted that Philo (2 <span class= "ital">Alleg.</span> p. 73) uses almost the same word to express the natural frailty and weakness of man's body--"What, then, is our life but the daily carrying about of a corpse?"<p><span class= "bld">That the life also of Jesus . . .</span>--The life of Jesus is the life of the new man, "created in righteousness and true holiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>). It is not that the Apostle is merely looking forward to the resurrection life, when we shall bear the image of the heavenly; he feels that the purpose of his sufferings now is that the higher life may, even in this present state, be manifested in and through them; and accordingly, as if to guard against the possibility of any other interpretation, he changes the phrase in the next verse, and for "our body" substitutes "our mortal flesh."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dying of the Lord Jesus;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the putting to death</span> (Vulgate, <span class="accented">mortificatio</span>). This is even stronger than <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>. It is not only "the sufferings," but even "the dying," of Christ of which his true followers partake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-36.htm">Romans 8:36</a>, "For thy sake are we killed all the day long"). St. Paul, who was "in deaths oft" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>), was thus being made conformable unto Christ's death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). Philo, too, compares life to "the daily carrying about of a corpse," and the Cure d'Ars used to speak of his body as "ce cadavre." <span class="cmt_word">That the life also of Jesus,</span> etc. The thought is exactly the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a>, "If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-12 The apostles were great sufferers, yet they met with wonderful support. Believers may be forsaken of their friends, as well as persecuted by enemies; but their God will never leave them nor forsake them. There may be fears within, as well as fightings without; yet we are not destroyed. The apostle speaks of their sufferings as a counterpart of the sufferings of Christ, that people might see the power of Christ's resurrection, and of grace in and from the living Jesus. In comparison with them, other Christians were, even at that time, in prosperous circumstances.</body></html>
