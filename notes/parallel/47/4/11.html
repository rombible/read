We are delivered as to a daily execution." The words are often interpreted--but, it is believed, wrongly--of the dangers and sufferings caused by persecution. The whole tenor of the Epistle suggests rather (see Note on preceding verse) the thought of the daily struggle with the pain and weakness of disease. It has been urged that the words "for Jesus' sake" determine the sense of the context as referring to the trials of persecution. The position is, however, scarcely tenable. The words, of course, as such, include the idea of such trials; but a man who laboured ceaselessly, as St. Paul laboured, as in a daily struggle with death, and yet went on working for the gospel of Christ, might well describe himself as bearing what he bore "for Jesus' sake."<p><span class= "bld">In our mortal flesh.</span>--The reason for the change in the last two words has been given in the Note on the preceding verse. The very "flesh" which, left to itself, is the source of corruption, moral and physical, is by the "excellence of the power of God" made the vehicle of manifesting the divine life. As has been well said: "God exhibits DEATH in the <span class= "ital">living</span> that He may also exhibit LIFE in the <span class= "ital">dying"</span> (Alford).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Jesus' sake.</span> St. Paul, as Bengel says, constantly thus repeats the name of Jesus, as one who felt its sweetness. The verse contains a reassertion and amplification of what he has just said. <span class="cmt_word">In our mortal flesh</span>. This is added almost by way of climax. The life of Jesus is manifested, not only "in our <span class="accented">body</span>," but even by way of triumph in its lowest and poorest element. God manifests life in our dying, and death in our living (Alford). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-12 The apostles were great sufferers, yet they met with wonderful support. Believers may be forsaken of their friends, as well as persecuted by enemies; but their God will never leave them nor forsake them. There may be fears within, as well as fightings without; yet we are not destroyed. The apostle speaks of their sufferings as a counterpart of the sufferings of Christ, that people might see the power of Christ's resurrection, and of grace in and from the living Jesus. In comparison with them, other Christians were, even at that time, in prosperous circumstances.</body></html>
