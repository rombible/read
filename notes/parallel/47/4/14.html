It is clear that he speaks here not of any deliverance from danger or disease, but of the resurrection of which he had spoken so fully in 1 Corinthians 15. The better MSS. give <span class= "ital">with Jesus,</span> the Received text having apparently originated in a desire to adapt the words to the fact that Christ had already risen. St. Paul's thoughts, however, dwell so continually on his fellowship with Christ that he thinks of the future resurrection of the body, no less than of the spiritual resurrection which he has already experienced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>), as not only wrought <span class= "ital">by</span> Him but associated <span class= "ital">with</span> Him; and in this hope of his he includes the Corinthians to whom he writes. It will then be seen, he trusts, that "life" has indeed been "working" in them. The verb "present," as describing the work of Christ, and, we may add, his own work as a minister of Christ, under this aspect, is a favourite one with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which raised up the Lord Jesus</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Shall raise up us also. The thought is again expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>. As he is here alluding mainly to the resurrection from the dead, it is clear that he contemplated the <span class="accented">possibility</span> of dying before Christ's second coming (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By Jesus.</span> The reading supported by nearly all the best manuscripts is "with Jesus" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, D, E, F, G), which perhaps appeared unsuitable to the copyists. But Christians are "risen with Christ" here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>); and in another sense also we rise <span class="accented">with</span> him, because the Church is "the body of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall present us with you.</span> So St. Jude speaks of "God our Saviour" as able "to present us" before the presence of his glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-24.htm">Jude 1:24, 25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 The grace of faith is an effectual remedy against fainting in times of trouble. They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrection was an earnest and assurance of theirs. The hope of this resurrection will encourage in a suffering day, and set us above the fear of death. Also, their sufferings were for the advantage of the church, and to God's glory. The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as their preaching and conversation, are for the good of the church and the glory of God. The prospect of eternal life and happiness was their support and comfort. What sense was ready to pronounce heavy and long, grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be light and short, and but for a moment. The weight of all temporal afflictions was lightness itself, while the glory to come was a substance, weighty, and lasting beyond description. If the apostle could call his heavy and long-continued trials light, and but for a moment, what must our trifling difficulties be! Faith enables to make this right judgment of things. There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen. And there is this vast difference between them; unseen things are eternal, seen things but temporal, or temporary only. Let us then look off from the things which are seen; let us cease to seek for worldly advantages, or to fear present distresses. Let us give diligence to make our future happiness sure.</body></html>
