The "look" is that of one who contemplates this or that as the end or goal for which he strives. The "things that are seen" are, of course, all the incidents and circumstances of the present life; the "things that are not seen" (the very phrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a>) are the objects of faith, immortality, eternal life, the crown of righteousness, the beatific vision. These things are subject to no time-limits, and endure through all the ages of God's purposes. The others are but for a brief season, and then are as though they had not been. Striking as the words are, they find an echo in the words of a contemporary seeker after wisdom: "These things (the things which most men seek after)," says Seneca (<span class= "ital">Ep.</span> lix.), "are but objects of the imagination, and present a show of being but for a time . . . Let us give our minds to the things which are eternal."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While we look not at the things which are seen.</span> The Greek suggests more of a reason, "Since we are not gazing at things visible" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Things which are not seen.</span> The negative is the <span class="accented">subjective</span> negative. It expresses not only the fact that now these things are not seen, but that it is their <span class="accented">nature</span> to be unseen by the bodily eyes. <span class="cmt_word">Temporal</span>. That is, temporary, transitory, phantasmal, a passing world; for which reason we do not fix our gaze or our aim upon it. But the things which are not seen are eternal The clause is important, as showing that eternity is not a mere extension of time, but a condition qualitatively different from time. The "things eternal" exist as much now as they will ever do. We are as much living in eternity now as we ever shall be. The only difference will be that we shall then see him who is now unseen, and realize the things which now are only visible to the eye of faith. This is one of the passages of St. Paul which finds a close parallel in Seneca ('Ep.,' 59). "<span class="accented">Invisibilia non decipiunt"</span> was, as Bishop Wordsworth tells us, the inscription put at the end of his garden arcade by Dr. Young, the poet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 The grace of faith is an effectual remedy against fainting in times of trouble. They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrection was an earnest and assurance of theirs. The hope of this resurrection will encourage in a suffering day, and set us above the fear of death. Also, their sufferings were for the advantage of the church, and to God's glory. The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as their preaching and conversation, are for the good of the church and the glory of God. The prospect of eternal life and happiness was their support and comfort. What sense was ready to pronounce heavy and long, grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be light and short, and but for a moment. The weight of all temporal afflictions was lightness itself, while the glory to come was a substance, weighty, and lasting beyond description. If the apostle could call his heavy and long-continued trials light, and but for a moment, what must our trifling difficulties be! Faith enables to make this right judgment of things. There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen. And there is this vast difference between them; unseen things are eternal, seen things but temporal, or temporary only. Let us then look off from the things which are seen; let us cease to seek for worldly advantages, or to fear present distresses. Let us give diligence to make our future happiness sure.</body></html>
