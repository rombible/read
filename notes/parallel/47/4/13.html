And then, as if pleading that this faith must find utterance, he falls back on the words that are in his mind, almost as an axiom, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-10.htm" title="I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:">Psalm 116:10</a> : "I believed, and therefore I spoke." It will be noted that the context of the words quoted is eminently in harmony with the feelings to which the Apostle has just given expression: "The sorrows of death compassed me; the pains of hell gat hold of me. I found trouble and heaviness . . . I was brought low . . . Thou hast delivered my soul from death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/116-3.htm" title="The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell got hold on me: I found trouble and sorrow.">Psalm 116:3-8</a>). It is as though that Psalm had been his stay and comfort in the midst of his daily conflict with disease.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We</span>; rather, <span class="accented">But we</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The same spirit of faith.</span> The spirit manifested by the psalmist in the quotation which follows. It is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a>, a psalm which corresponded with St. Paul's mood because it was written in trouble sustained by faith. And this faith inspires him with the conviction that, after "the body of this death," and after this death in life, there should begin for him also the life in death. St. Paul says nothing as to the authorship of the psalm, which probably belongs to a period far later than that of David. The words are from the LXX., and seem fairly to represent the disputed sense of the original. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 The grace of faith is an effectual remedy against fainting in times of trouble. They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrection was an earnest and assurance of theirs. The hope of this resurrection will encourage in a suffering day, and set us above the fear of death. Also, their sufferings were for the advantage of the church, and to God's glory. The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as their preaching and conversation, are for the good of the church and the glory of God. The prospect of eternal life and happiness was their support and comfort. What sense was ready to pronounce heavy and long, grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be light and short, and but for a moment. The weight of all temporal afflictions was lightness itself, while the glory to come was a substance, weighty, and lasting beyond description. If the apostle could call his heavy and long-continued trials light, and but for a moment, what must our trifling difficulties be! Faith enables to make this right judgment of things. There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen. And there is this vast difference between them; unseen things are eternal, seen things but temporal, or temporary only. Let us then look off from the things which are seen; let us cease to seek for worldly advantages, or to fear present distresses. Let us give diligence to make our future happiness sure.</body></html>
