The god of this world did his work of blinding; the true God called light out of darkness.

The word for "give light" is the same as that rendered "radiance" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2Corinthians 4:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who commanded the light to shine out of darkness.</span> The argument of the verse is that God, who created the material light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>) and who is the Father of lights (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>) and sent his Son to be the Light of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), did not shine in our hearts for our sakes only, or that we might hide the light under a bushel for ourselves, but that we might transmit and reflect it. There is an implied comparison between the creation of light and the dawn of the gospel light, and each of these was meant for the good of all the world. The verse should be rendered, if we follow the best manuscripts, "Because it is God, who said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shone in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God." <span class="cmt_word">In the face of Jesus Christ</span> (see ch. 2:10; 3:7). Probably, however, there is a reference to the glory of God, not as <span class="accented">reflected</span> from the face of Christ, but as concentrated in and beaming from it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The best of men would faint, if they did not receive mercy from God. And that mercy which has helped us out, and helped us on, hitherto, we may rely upon to help us even to the end. The apostles had no base and wicked designs, covered with fair and specious pretences. They did not try to make their ministry serve a turn. Sincerity or uprightness will keep the favourable opinion of wise and good men. Christ by his gospel makes a glorious discovery to the minds of men. But the design of the devil is, to keep men in ignorance; and when he cannot keep the light of the gospel of Christ out of the world, he spares no pains to keep men from the gospel, or to set them against it. The rejection of the gospel is here traced to the wilful blindness and wickedness of the human heart. Self was not the matter or the end of the apostles' preaching; they preached Christ as Jesus, the Saviour and Deliverer, who saves to the uttermost all that come to God through him. Ministers are servants to the souls of men; they must avoid becoming servants to the humours or the lusts of men. It is pleasant to behold the sun in the firmament; but it is more pleasant and profitable for the gospel to shine in the heart. As light was the beginning of the first creation; so, in the new creation, the light of the Spirit is his first work upon the soul. The treasure of gospel light and grace is put into earthen vessels. The ministers of the gospel are subject to the same passions and weaknesses as other men. God could have sent angels to make known the glorious doctrine of the gospel, or could have sent the most admired sons of men to teach the nations, but he chose humbler, weaker vessels, that his power might be more glorified in upholding them, and in the blessed change wrought by their ministry.</body></html>
