The world which "lieth in wickedness," perhaps <span class= "ital">in the evil one</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm" title="And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.">1John 5:19</a>), worships the spirit of hate and falsehood and selfishness, and in so doing it practically deifies the devil. And the work of that god of this world is directly in antagonism to that of God. He seeks to lead men back from light to darkness. "<span class= "ital">He blinded</span>" (the Greek tense indicates an act in past time without necessarily including the idea of its continuance in the present) "the minds of the <span class= "ital">unbelievers."</span> The noun is probably used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.">1Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-27.htm" title="If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and you be disposed to go; whatever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.">1Corinthians 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-22.htm" title="Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.">1Corinthians 14:22-24</a>, with a special reference to the outside heathen world. Their spiritual state was, St. Paul seems to say, lower than that of Israel. The veil was over the heart of the one; the very organs of spiritual perception were blinded in the other.<p><span class= "bld">Lest the light of the glorious gospel.</span>--Better <span class= "ital">to the end that the radiance</span> (or, <span class= "ital">light-giving power</span>)<span class= "ital"> of the gospel of the glory of God . . .</span> The words describe not merely a purpose, but a result. The word for "light" here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.">2Corinthians 4:6</a>, is not the simple noun commonly used, but a secondary form, derived from the verb "to give light" or "illumine." The English version "glorious," though a partial equivalent for the Greek idiom of the genitive of a characteristic attribute, lacks the vigour and emphasis of the original, which expresses the thought that the gospel is not only glorious itself, but shares in the glory of Christ, and has that for its theme and object. But even that gospel may fail of its purpose. The blind cannot see even the brightness of the noon-day sun. The eye of the soul has to receive sight first. So, in the mission to the Gentiles given to the Apostle on his conversion, his first work was "to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Christ, who is the image of God.</span>--The Greek word is used in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a> for the image of God, after which man was created. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7</a> man is spoken of as "the image and glory of God." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a> it stands as intermediate between the object and the shadow, far plainer than the latter, yet not identical with the former, however adequately representing it.<p><span class= "bld">Should shine unto them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">should irradiate,</span> or, <span class= "ital">cast its beams upon them.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The god of this world;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the god of this age</span>. It is, as Bengel says, "a great and horrible description of the devil." He is not, however, here called a god of the kosmos, but only of the <span class="accented">olam hazzeh</span>, the present dispensation of things as it exists among those who refuse to enter that kingdom in which the power of Satan is brought to nought. The melancholy attempt to get rid of Manichean arguments by rendering the verse "in whom God blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers of this world" is set aside by the fact that the terrible description of Satan as "another god" (<span class="accented">El acheer</span>) was common among the rabbis. They knew that his power was indeed a derivative power, trot still that it was permitted to be great (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a> (John 14:30) our Lord speaks of him as "the ruler of the kosmos." <span class="cmt_word">Hath blinded;</span> rather, <span class="accented">blinded</span>. The verb here has no other meaning than "to blind," and is quite different from the verb "to harden," rendered by "to blind" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a> with the same substantive. They are blind from lack of faith, and so being "unbelieving" they are" perishing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>), seeing that they "walk in darkness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and are in Satan's power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>). Blindness of heart," says St. Augustine, "is both a sin and a punishment of sin and a cause of sin." <span class="cmt_word">The light of the glorious gospel of Christ</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the illumination of the gospel of the glory of the Christ</span>. The word <span class="accented">photismos</span> in later ecclesiastical Greek was used for "baptism." <span class="cmt_word">Who is the image of God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Should shine unto them;</span> or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">should dawn upon them</span>. The other rendering, "that they should not <span class="accented">see</span> the illumination," gives to the verb <span class="accented">augazo</span>, a rarer sense, only found in poetry, and not known to the LXX. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The best of men would faint, if they did not receive mercy from God. And that mercy which has helped us out, and helped us on, hitherto, we may rely upon to help us even to the end. The apostles had no base and wicked designs, covered with fair and specious pretences. They did not try to make their ministry serve a turn. Sincerity or uprightness will keep the favourable opinion of wise and good men. Christ by his gospel makes a glorious discovery to the minds of men. But the design of the devil is, to keep men in ignorance; and when he cannot keep the light of the gospel of Christ out of the world, he spares no pains to keep men from the gospel, or to set them against it. The rejection of the gospel is here traced to the wilful blindness and wickedness of the human heart. Self was not the matter or the end of the apostles' preaching; they preached Christ as Jesus, the Saviour and Deliverer, who saves to the uttermost all that come to God through him. Ministers are servants to the souls of men; they must avoid becoming servants to the humours or the lusts of men. It is pleasant to behold the sun in the firmament; but it is more pleasant and profitable for the gospel to shine in the heart. As light was the beginning of the first creation; so, in the new creation, the light of the Spirit is his first work upon the soul. The treasure of gospel light and grace is put into earthen vessels. The ministers of the gospel are subject to the same passions and weaknesses as other men. God could have sent angels to make known the glorious doctrine of the gospel, or could have sent the most admired sons of men to teach the nations, but he chose humbler, weaker vessels, that his power might be more glorified in upholding them, and in the blessed change wrought by their ministry.</body></html>
