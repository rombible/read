He has defended himself against the charge of "fickleness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?">2Corinthians 1:17</a>), but another charge, more disturbing still, had also been brought against him. Men had talked, so he had been told, of his "craftiness" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm" title="But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.">2Corinthians 12:16</a>), and to that imputation, perhaps also to another covered by the same general term (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-12.htm" title="For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.">Ephesians 5:12</a>, and Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2Corinthians 7:1-2</a>), he now addresses himself. The English word "dishonesty" is used in its older and wider sense. So in Wiclif we have "honest" members of the body in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-23.htm" title="And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.">1Corinthians 12:23</a>, and in Shakespeare and old English writers generally, and in popular usage even now, "honesty" in a woman is equivalent to chastity. The context shows, however, that St. Paul speaks chiefly not of sensual vices, nor yet of dishonesty in the modern sense of the word, but of subtlety, underhand practices, and the like. Men seem to have tried to fasten his reputation on the two horns of a dilemma. Either his change of plan indicated a discreditable fickleness, or if not that, something more discreditable still.<p><span class= "bld">Nor handling the word of God deceitfully.</span>--The word is nearly equivalent to the "corrupting" or "adulterating" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>. In "commending ourselves" we trace a return to the topic of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>. Yes, he acknowledged that he did "commend himself," but it was by the manifestation of truth as the only means that he adopted; and he appealed not to men's tastes, or prejudices, or humours, but to that in them which was highest--their conscience, their sense of right and wrong; and in doing this he felt that he was speaking and acting in the presence of the great Judge, who is also the searcher of hearts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But have renounced;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but we renounced</span>. We renounced them once and forever at our baptism. <span class="cmt_word">The hidden things of dishonesty;</span> literally, <span class="accented">of shame</span>; meaning, of course, of all that causes shame. Disgraceful as may be calunmies of my Jewish opponents, I have said farewell forever to everything for which a good man would blush. "Honest" was originally like the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, a general expression for moral excellence, as in Pope's line - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"An honest man's the noblest work of God."</span> Fletcher's - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Man is his own star, and the soul that can<br />Be honest is the only perfect man."</span> <span class="cmt_word">In craftiness.</span> The word implies all subtle, cunning, underhand dealing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>), and it is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a> that St. Paul had been charged with such conduct. The word is both used and illustrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-23.htm">Luke 20:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Handling the word of God deceitfully.</span> He has already repudiated this charge by implication in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>, and he was always anxious to maintain an attitude of transparent sincerity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>) by uttering the truth and the whole truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>), and not adulterating it. He had to meet such insinuations even in his first extant letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By manifestation of the truth</span>. The constant recurrence to this thought shows the apostle's anxiety to remove the suspicion, created by the attacks of his opponents, that he had an <span class="accented">esoteric</span> teaching for some (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-13.htm">2 Corinthians 1:13</a>), kept some of his doctrines "The truth" cannot be preached by the aid of lies. The prominence of the word "manifest" in this Epistle is remarkable. St. Paul seems to be haunted by it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-6.htm">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Commending ourselves.</span> This is the only form of self-commendation or of "commendatory letter" for which I care. There is evidently a reference to the same verb used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Before God</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm">Galatians 1:20</a>). These solemn appeals are meant to show that it would be morally impossible for him to act as he was charged with acting. If he can assert his own integrity he will do so only as consciously in the presence of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The best of men would faint, if they did not receive mercy from God. And that mercy which has helped us out, and helped us on, hitherto, we may rely upon to help us even to the end. The apostles had no base and wicked designs, covered with fair and specious pretences. They did not try to make their ministry serve a turn. Sincerity or uprightness will keep the favourable opinion of wise and good men. Christ by his gospel makes a glorious discovery to the minds of men. But the design of the devil is, to keep men in ignorance; and when he cannot keep the light of the gospel of Christ out of the world, he spares no pains to keep men from the gospel, or to set them against it. The rejection of the gospel is here traced to the wilful blindness and wickedness of the human heart. Self was not the matter or the end of the apostles' preaching; they preached Christ as Jesus, the Saviour and Deliverer, who saves to the uttermost all that come to God through him. Ministers are servants to the souls of men; they must avoid becoming servants to the humours or the lusts of men. It is pleasant to behold the sun in the firmament; but it is more pleasant and profitable for the gospel to shine in the heart. As light was the beginning of the first creation; so, in the new creation, the light of the Spirit is his first work upon the soul. The treasure of gospel light and grace is put into earthen vessels. The ministers of the gospel are subject to the same passions and weaknesses as other men. God could have sent angels to make known the glorious doctrine of the gospel, or could have sent the most admired sons of men to teach the nations, but he chose humbler, weaker vessels, that his power might be more glorified in upholding them, and in the blessed change wrought by their ministry.</body></html>
