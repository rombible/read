The treasure is "the knowledge of the glory of God" as possessed by the Apostle. It was the practice of Eastern kings, who stored up their treasures of gold and silver, to fill jars of earthenware with coin or bullion (Herod. iii. 103. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-14.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.">Jeremiah 32:14</a>). "So," St. Paul says, in a tone of profound humility, "it is with us. In these frail bodies of ours--'earthen vessels'--we have that priceless treasure." The passage is instructive, as showing that the "vessels of wood and of earth" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-20.htm" title="But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.">2Timothy 2:20</a> are not necessarily identical with those made for dishonour. The words have probably a side glance at the taunts that had been thrown out as to his bodily infirmities. "Be it so," he says; "we admit all that can be said on that score, and it is that men may see that the excellence of the power which we exercise comes from God, and not from ourselves." The words that follow, contrasting sufferings and infirmities in their manifold variety with the way in which they were borne through God's strengthening grace, show this to be the true underlying sequence of thought.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-15.</span> <span class="accented">- Glory of the ministry in the midst of its weakness and suffering</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In earthen vessels.</span> The glorious light which we have to show to the world is, like Gideon's torches, carried in earthen pitchers. The word <span class="accented">skenos</span>, vessel, is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-16.htm">Mark 11:16</a>, and "vessels of earthenware" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>. St. Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, is called "a vessel of election," whence Dante calls him <span class="accented">lo vas d</span> <span class="accented">elezione</span>. Man can never be more than an earthen vessel, being frail and humble, and the metaphor specially suits an apostle of Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a>). But when he takes the Word of life from the earthen pitcher and waves it in the air, it illuminates all on whom the light shines. No commentator seems to have seen the probable allusion to Gideon's pitchers. It is the "light," of which he has been speaking exclusively in the last verses, which constitutes the "treasure." Those who suppose that the "treasure" is gold or silver or something else of value, refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a>, and Herod., 3:103; Pers., 'Sat.,' 2:10. <span class="cmt_word">The excellency</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the excess</span> or <span class="accented">abundance</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Of God, and not of us;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of God, and not from us</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The best of men would faint, if they did not receive mercy from God. And that mercy which has helped us out, and helped us on, hitherto, we may rely upon to help us even to the end. The apostles had no base and wicked designs, covered with fair and specious pretences. They did not try to make their ministry serve a turn. Sincerity or uprightness will keep the favourable opinion of wise and good men. Christ by his gospel makes a glorious discovery to the minds of men. But the design of the devil is, to keep men in ignorance; and when he cannot keep the light of the gospel of Christ out of the world, he spares no pains to keep men from the gospel, or to set them against it. The rejection of the gospel is here traced to the wilful blindness and wickedness of the human heart. Self was not the matter or the end of the apostles' preaching; they preached Christ as Jesus, the Saviour and Deliverer, who saves to the uttermost all that come to God through him. Ministers are servants to the souls of men; they must avoid becoming servants to the humours or the lusts of men. It is pleasant to behold the sun in the firmament; but it is more pleasant and profitable for the gospel to shine in the heart. As light was the beginning of the first creation; so, in the new creation, the light of the Spirit is his first work upon the soul. The treasure of gospel light and grace is put into earthen vessels. The ministers of the gospel are subject to the same passions and weaknesses as other men. God could have sent angels to make known the glorious doctrine of the gospel, or could have sent the most admired sons of men to teach the nations, but he chose humbler, weaker vessels, that his power might be more glorified in upholding them, and in the blessed change wrought by their ministry.</body></html>
