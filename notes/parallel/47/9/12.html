In classical Greek it stands for any public service rendered to the State. In the LXX. version it, and its cognate verb and adjective, are used almost exclusively of the ritual and sacrificial services of the Tabernacle and the Temple, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-25.htm" title="And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above on it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1Chronicles 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-30.htm" title="And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.">1Chronicles 26:30</a>; and in this sense it appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.">Luke 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm" title="Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.">Hebrews 9:21</a>; and with the same shade of meaning, used figuratively, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Philippians 2:17</a>. That meaning survives in the ecclesiastical term "liturgy," applied, as it was at first, exclusively to the service of the celebration of the Lord's Supper. Here, probably, the thought is implied that a large and liberal gift to Christ's poor, and for His sake, is the most acceptable of all forms of "service" in the liturgical sense of that word. So understood it implies the same truth as that stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">James 1:27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Not only supplieth the want of the saints.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">fills up the things that were lacking.</span> The wants of the "saints," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the disciples of Jerusalem, were, we must remember, very urgent. They had never quite recovered from the pressure of the famine foretold by Agabus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>), and the lavish generosity of the first days of the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-44.htm" title="And all that believed were together, and had all things common;">Acts 2:44-45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm" title="And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.">Acts 4:32</a>) had naturally exhausted its resources.<p><span class= "bld">But is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">overflows, by means of many thanksgivings, to God:</span> the latter noun standing in a closer connection with the verb than the English version suggests.

Generally it means "religious service" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>).

It <span class="accented">overflows</span> as it were in the form of thanksgivings to Galatians <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-15 Money bestowed in charity, may to the carnal mind seem thrown away, but when given from proper principles, it is seed sown, from which a valuable increase may be expected. It should be given carefully. Works of charity, like other good works, should be done with thought and design. Due thought, as to our circumstances, and those we are about to relieve, will direct our gifts for charitable uses. Help should be given freely, be it more or less; not grudgingly, but cheerfully. While some scatter, and yet increase; others withhold more than is meet, and it tends to poverty. If we had more faith and love, we should waste less on ourselves, and sow more in hope of a plentiful increase. Can a man lose by doing that with which God is pleased? He is able to make all grace abound towards us, and to abound in us; to give a large increase of spiritual and of temporal good things. He can make us to have enough in all things; and to be content with what we have. God gives not only enough for ourselves, but that also wherewith we may supply the wants of others, and this should be as seed to be sown. We must show the reality of our subjection to the gospel, by works of charity. This will be for the credit of our profession, and to the praise and glory of God. Let us endeavour to copy the example of Christ, being unwearied in doing good, and deeming it more blessed to give than to receive. Blessed be God for the unspeakable gift of his grace, whereby he enables and inclines some of his people to bestow upon others, and others to be grateful for it; and blessed be his glorious name to all eternity, for Jesus Christ, that inestimable gift of his love, through whom this and every other good thing, pertaining to life and godliness, are freely given unto us, beyond all expression, measure, or bounds.</body></html>
