The word so translated (<span class= "ital">hypostasis</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> literally, "that which stands under, the base or ground of anything," has the interest of a long subsequent history in metaphysical and theological controversies, of which we find, perhaps, the first trace in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>, where it appears as "person," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a>, where it is rendered "substance." (See Notes on those passages.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a>, it has the same meaning as in this passage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They of Macedonia;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Macedonians</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any friends from Macedonia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). Shall Achaians have to blush before Macedonians? <span class="cmt_word">We, that we say not ye.</span> Nothing can exceed the delicacy of this touch. St. Paul asks them to be ready with their contributions for <span class="accented">his</span> sake, not for their own; that <span class="accented">he</span> may not have to blush for his generous words respecting them, whereas really the discredit would be simply theirs. <span class="cmt_word">Confident boasting;</span> rather, <span class="accented">confidence</span>. The reading "of boasting" is not genuine here. For the word <span class="accented">hypostasis</span> in the sense of "confidence," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-4.htm">Hebrews 3:4</a>. The use of the word to represent the "Persons" of the Blessed Trinity is later. The other sense of the word, "substance" (or underlying base of attributes), is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 When we would have others do good, we must act toward them prudently and tenderly, and give them time. Christians should consider what is for the credit of their profession, and endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. The duty of ministering to the saints is so plain, that there would seem no need to exhort Christians to it; yet self-love contends so powerfully against the love of Christ, that it is often necessary to stir up their minds by way of remembrance.</body></html>
