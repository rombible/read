Originally it expressed the act of one who undertook to defray the expenses of the chorus of a Greek theatre. As this was an act of somewhat stately generosity, the verb got a wider range, and was applied to any such act, and was so transferred in like manner by the Apostle, probably, as far as we can trace, for the first time, to the divine bounty. It may be noted that it was not so used by the LXX. translators. The word indeed occurs but once in that version, in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/25-22.htm" title="A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach.">Ecclesiasticus 25:22</a> ("if a woman <span class= "ital">maintain</span> her husband"). In its higher sense it becomes a somewhat favourite word with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>), and is used by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:11</a>) after he had become acquainted with St. Paul's Epistles, and possibly enriched his vocabulary through them.<p>The phrase "seed to the sower" occurs, with a different verb, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm" title="For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:">Isaiah 55:10</a>. In the words that follow, "the fruits of righteousness," there is an obvious reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm" title="Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness on you.">Hosea 10:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm" title="Shall horses run on the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for you have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:">Amos 6:12</a>. The phrase occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Philippians 1:11</a>. The construction, according to the better MSS., varies somewhat from that of the Authorised version. <span class= "ital">He that bounteously giveth seed to the sower and bread for food</span> (the beneficence of God thought of, as shown both in seed-time and harvest) <span class= "ital">shall give bounteously, and multiply your seed, and increase the produce of your righteousness.</span> "Righteousness" is taken, as before, as specially presented under the aspect of alms-giving.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that ministereth.</span> The verb used is <span class="accented">epichoregein</span>, to furnish abundantly. At Athens a <span class="accented">choragus</span> was one who furnished a chorus, and as this was a <span class="accented">leitourgia</span> (or "public service"), involving great expense, and often discharged with extreme munificence, the verb came to imply "provide abundantly." St. Paul may (so to speak) have "picked up the word" at Athens. <span class="cmt_word">Seed to the sower</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Both minister.</span> The true reading almost certainly is "<span class="accented">will</span> both supply bread for food, and <span class="accented">will</span> multiply your seed for sowing, and <span class="accented">will</span> increase the fruits of your righteousness" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>, LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">The fruits of your righteousness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>, LXX.). In "righteousness," as in all things else, it is God only who "gives the increase" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-15 Money bestowed in charity, may to the carnal mind seem thrown away, but when given from proper principles, it is seed sown, from which a valuable increase may be expected. It should be given carefully. Works of charity, like other good works, should be done with thought and design. Due thought, as to our circumstances, and those we are about to relieve, will direct our gifts for charitable uses. Help should be given freely, be it more or less; not grudgingly, but cheerfully. While some scatter, and yet increase; others withhold more than is meet, and it tends to poverty. If we had more faith and love, we should waste less on ourselves, and sow more in hope of a plentiful increase. Can a man lose by doing that with which God is pleased? He is able to make all grace abound towards us, and to abound in us; to give a large increase of spiritual and of temporal good things. He can make us to have enough in all things; and to be content with what we have. God gives not only enough for ourselves, but that also wherewith we may supply the wants of others, and this should be as seed to be sown. We must show the reality of our subjection to the gospel, by works of charity. This will be for the credit of our profession, and to the praise and glory of God. Let us endeavour to copy the example of Christ, being unwearied in doing good, and deeming it more blessed to give than to receive. Blessed be God for the unspeakable gift of his grace, whereby he enables and inclines some of his people to bestow upon others, and others to be grateful for it; and blessed be his glorious name to all eternity, for Jesus Christ, that inestimable gift of his love, through whom this and every other good thing, pertaining to life and godliness, are freely given unto us, beyond all expression, measure, or bounds.</body></html>
