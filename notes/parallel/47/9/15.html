We are left to conjecture to what gift the Apostle refers: whether to the love of God as manifested in Christ, or to the spirit of love poured into men's hearts. The use of the word in the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.">Acts 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-45.htm" title="And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 10:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm" title="For as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?">Acts 11:17</a>) is in favour of referring it to the gift of the Holy Ghost; that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a>, to the gift of pardon or righteousness. Probably it did not enter into his thoughts to subject the jubilant utterance of praise to a minute analysis.<p>At this stage there was manifestly another pause, of greater or less length, in the act of dictating. Fresh thoughts of a different kind are working in his mind, and rousing feelings of a very different kind from those which had been just expressed. At last he again breaks silence and begins anew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thanks be unto God.</span> Nothing ever seems so much to disburden the full heart of St. Paul after deep emotion as an utterance of thanksgiving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm">1 Timothy 1:17</a>). The thanksgiving here is like a great sigh of relief. The subject of it is perfectly general. It is not a mere "Amen" uttered, as it were, by St. Paul at the end of the thanksgivings of the saints at Jerusalem which he has been presupposing; but an offering of thanks to God for the issues of grace in general, all summed up in one act of "inestimable love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-15 Money bestowed in charity, may to the carnal mind seem thrown away, but when given from proper principles, it is seed sown, from which a valuable increase may be expected. It should be given carefully. Works of charity, like other good works, should be done with thought and design. Due thought, as to our circumstances, and those we are about to relieve, will direct our gifts for charitable uses. Help should be given freely, be it more or less; not grudgingly, but cheerfully. While some scatter, and yet increase; others withhold more than is meet, and it tends to poverty. If we had more faith and love, we should waste less on ourselves, and sow more in hope of a plentiful increase. Can a man lose by doing that with which God is pleased? He is able to make all grace abound towards us, and to abound in us; to give a large increase of spiritual and of temporal good things. He can make us to have enough in all things; and to be content with what we have. God gives not only enough for ourselves, but that also wherewith we may supply the wants of others, and this should be as seed to be sown. We must show the reality of our subjection to the gospel, by works of charity. This will be for the credit of our profession, and to the praise and glory of God. Let us endeavour to copy the example of Christ, being unwearied in doing good, and deeming it more blessed to give than to receive. Blessed be God for the unspeakable gift of his grace, whereby he enables and inclines some of his people to bestow upon others, and others to be grateful for it; and blessed be his glorious name to all eternity, for Jesus Christ, that inestimable gift of his love, through whom this and every other good thing, pertaining to life and godliness, are freely given unto us, beyond all expression, measure, or bounds.</body></html>
