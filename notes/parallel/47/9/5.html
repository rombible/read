There were to be no hurried and unsatisfactory collections then.<p><span class= "bld">Your bounty, whereof ye had notice before.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">your bounty, announced before.</span> He is not referring to any notice that he had given, whether in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1-2</a> or elsewhere, but to the announcement that he himself had made to the churches of Macedonia. The word for "bounty" (<span class= "ital">eulogia</span>) has, like that for "confidence" in the preceding verse, the interest of an ecclesiastical history attaching to it. Literally, it means a "blessing;" then, as in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-11.htm" title="No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.">Genesis 23:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-15.htm" title="And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.">Judges 1:15</a>, it was used for the "gift," which is the outward token or accompaniment of a blessing. In liturgical language, as connected with the "cup of <span class= "ital">blessing,"</span> it was applied--(1) to the consecrated bread and wine of the Lord's Supper generally; (2) specially to those portions which were reserved to be sent to the sick and other absentees; (3) when that practice fell into disuse, to the unconsecrated remains; and (4) to gifts of bread or cake to friends or the poor, as a residuum of the old distributions at the Agapae, or Feasts of Charity.<p><span class= "bld">As a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</span>--The bearing of the last word is not quite obvious. Probably what is meant is this:--"Let your gift be worthy of what you call it, a 'blessing' expressed in act, not the grudging gift of one who, as he gives, is intent on gaining some advantage through his seeming generosity." So understood, it expresses the same thought as Shakespeare's well-known lines:--<p>"The quality of mercy is not strained,<p>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes."<p>It is possible, however, that the word "covetousness" had been applied tauntingly to St. Paul himself, as always "asking for more," always "having his hand" (as is sometimes said of active organising secretaries in our own time) "in people's pockets," and that this is his answer to that taunt. The use of the corresponding verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2Corinthians 12:17-18</a>, is strongly in favour of this view. "Don't look on this business," he seems to say, "as a self-interested work of mine. Think of it as, in every sense of the word, a blessing both to givers and receivers."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they would go before unto you.</span> The triple repetition of the word "before" shows how earnest St. Paul is in the matter. The Corinthians had promised largely; it was evident that there had been, or that there was ground for fearing that there might be, some slackness of performance. St. Paul was so unwilling to have seemed inaccurate in what, he had said about them in Macedonia that he wished to give them ample notice before the Macedonian delegates arrived. <span class="cmt_word">Your bounty, whereof ye had notice before;</span> <span class="accented">your previously promised blessing, bounty</span>; literally, <span class="accented">blessing</span>. The mere word should have acted as an inducement to generosity. See the use of the word to express a generous gift in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>, etc. (LXX.); <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>. In this sense it resembles the Hebrew <span class="accented">berachah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">As a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness;</span> <span class="accented">as a blessing, and not as an extortion</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a free gift of your own, and not as something which I had wrung from you, or "got out of you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-17.htm">2 Corinthians 12:17, 18</a>). It is less likely that the word <span class="accented">pleonexia</span> refers to the "parsimony" of the Corinthians, as though the <span class="accented">smallness</span> of their gift would show their greed for large gains. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 When we would have others do good, we must act toward them prudently and tenderly, and give them time. Christians should consider what is for the credit of their profession, and endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. The duty of ministering to the saints is so plain, that there would seem no need to exhort Christians to it; yet self-love contends so powerfully against the love of Christ, that it is often necessary to stir up their minds by way of remembrance.</body></html>
