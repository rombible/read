He had come from Troas full of anxiety and agitation. He arrived in Macedonia. Much remained the same. His body was still suffering from want of rest, even though his spirit had found relief in the thought that the coming of Titus could not now be far off. (Comp. "our <span class= "ital">flesh"</span> here, with "I had no rest for my <span class= "ital">spirit</span>" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.">2Corinthians 2:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Without were fightings, within were fears.</span>--We have no knowledge to what the first clause refers. It is natural to think either of dangers and persecutions from the heathen, or, probably, of conflicts with the party of the circumcision, or, as he calls them in Philippians 3, of the "concision," at Philippi. The "fears" manifestly refer to his alarm and anxiety about the effect produced by his first Epistle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For, when we were come into Macedonia.</span> "For <span class="accented">even</span> when we came." The word "affliction" reminds St. Paul to resume the thread of the narrative which makes this letter almost <span class="accented">like an itinerary</span>. He has spoken of his trials in Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>) and in the Troad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12, 13</a>), and now he tells them that <span class="accented">even</span> in Macedonia he was no less troubled and agitated. <span class="cmt_word">Our flesh had no rest.</span> <span class="accented">External</span> troubles assailed him as well as inward anxiety. "Had" seems here to be the best reading (B, F, G, K); not "has had," which may be borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>. <span class="accented">Rest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remission, respite</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>But we were troubled on every side;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but in everything being afflicted</span>. The style, in its picturesque irregularity, almost seems as though it were broken by sobs. <span class="cmt_word">Without were fightings, within were fears.</span> "From without battles, from within fears." No light is thrown on these "battles." The Acts of the Apostles has no details to give us of this brief stay in Macedonia. The "fears" were doubtless still connected with anxiety as to the reception of Titus, and of his First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-20.htm">1 Corinthians 12:20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:5-11 There were fightings without, or continual contentions with, and opposition from Jews and Gentiles; and there were fears within, and great concern for such as had embraced the Christian faith. But God comforts those who are cast down. We should look above and beyond all means and instruments, to God, as the author of all the consolation and good we enjoy. Sorrow according to the will of God, tending to the glory of God, and wrought by the Spirit of God, renders the heart humble, contrite, submissive, disposed to mortify every sin, and to walk in newness of life. And this repentance is connected with saving faith in Christ, and an interest in his atonement. There is a great difference between this sorrow of a godly sort, and the sorrow of the world. The happy fruits of true repentance are mentioned. Where the heart is changed, the life and actions will be changed. It wrought indignation at sin, at themselves, at the tempter and his instruments. It wrought a fear of watchfulness, and a cautious fear of sin. It wrought desire to be reconciled with God. It wrought zeal for duty, and against sin. It wrought revenge against sin and their own folly, by endeavours to make satisfaction for injuries done thereby. Deep humility before God, hatred of all sin, with faith in Christ, a new heart and a new life, make repentance unto salvation. May the Lord bestow it on every one of us.</body></html>
