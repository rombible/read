In each there is the contrast between the high ideal to which the believer in Christ is called and the infinite debasement into which he may possibly sink. St. John characteristically presents the law of the spiritual life as a generalised fact of experience: "Every man who has the hope actually does purify himself." The word for "filthiness" does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. In <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/1-27.htm" title="Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliver them that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God.">2 Maccabees 1:27</a>, it is used of the "pollution" of idolatry; in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm" title="I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.">Jeremiah 23:14</a> (where the English version gives "a horrible thing," and the margin "filthiness") of the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. The cognate verb is used of sexual impurity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm" title="These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.">Revelation 14:4</a>, and probably with the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm" title="You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.">Revelation 3:4</a>, and this is manifestly what St. Paul has in his thoughts here. The two thoughts--idolatry and impurity--were inextricably blended in his mind. He had been warning men against the feasts that were held in the idol's temple. He cannot close his eyes to the "hidden things of shame" that were their constant and inevitable accompaniments. But that contagion of impurity might spread to the inward parts. Mind and conscience might be defiled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-15.htm" title="To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.">Titus 1:15</a>). The literature of the Empire, as seen in Catullus and Martial and Juvenal, shows only too terribly what St. Paul meant by "filthiness of the spirit." The very element in man by which he is raised above the brute creatures that lead a simply animal or natural life--his imagination, fancy, discernment of analogies--sinks him to an infinite depth below them.<p><span class= "bld">Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</span>--The word for "holiness" involves the idea of consecration, and grows out of the thought that the "saints" of God make up collectively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2Corinthians 6:16</a>, the Temple in which He dwells. As the former clause of the verse presents the negative aspect of purity, abstinence from all that desecrates, this presents the positive, the perfect consecration, and this is wrought out in its completeness, in "the fear of God"--the reverential awe before the thought of God's presence. The word is the same as that mis-translated "terror" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.">2Corinthians 5:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having then these promises.</span> The promises of God's indwelling and fatherly love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Dearly beloved.</span> Perhaps the word is added to soften the sternness of the preceding admonition. <span class="cmt_word">Let us cleanse ourselves.</span> Every Christian, even the best, has need of daily cleansing from his daily assoilment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>), and this cleansing depends on the purifying activity of moral effort maintained by the help of God's grace. Similarly St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1-3</a>), after speaking of God's fatherhood and the hopes which it inspires, adds, "And every man that hath this hope <span class="accented">in him purifieth himself</span> even as he is pure" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From all filthiness;</span> rather, <span class="accented">from all defilement</span>. Sin leaves on the soul the moral stain of guilt, which was typified by the ceremonial defilements of the Levitical Law (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25, 26</a>). The word used for "filth" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> is different. <span class="cmt_word">Of the flesh and spirit.</span> From everything which outwardly pollutes the body and inwardly the soul; the two being closely connected together, so that what defiles the flesh inevitably also defiles the soul, and what defiles the spirit degrades also the body. Uncleanness, for instance, a sin of the flesh, is almost invariably connected with pride and hate and cruelty, which degrade the soul. <span class="cmt_word">Perfecting holiness.</span> This is the goal and aim of the Christian, though in this life it cannot be finally attained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the fear of God.</span> There is, indeed, one kind of fear, a base and servile fear, which is cast out by perfect love; but the fear of reverential awe always remains in the true and wisely instructed Christian, who will never be guilty of the profane familiarity adopted by some ignorant sectarians, or speak of God "as though he were some one in the next street" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-4 The promises of God are strong reasons for us to follow after holiness; we must cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit. If we hope in God as our Father, we must seek to be holy as he is holy, and perfect as our Father in heaven. His grace, by the influences of his Spirit, alone can purify, but holiness should be the object of our constant prayers. If the ministers of the gospel are thought contemptible, there is danger lest the gospel itself be despised also; and though ministers must flatter none, yet they must be gentle towards all. Ministers may look for esteem and favour, when they can safely appeal to the people, that they have corrupted no man by false doctrines or flattering speeches; that they have defrauded no man; nor sought to promote their own interests so as to hurt any. It was affection to them made the apostle speak so freely to them, and caused him to glory of them, in all places, and upon all occasions.</body></html>
