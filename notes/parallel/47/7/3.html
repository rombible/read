We trace here a sudden revulsion of feeling. What he had just said seemed to imply that he condemned them for even listening to the calumnies which had been circulated against him, for joining in any measure even of outward friendship with men of evil lives; and then there rushes on his memory the recollection of all the good news which Titus had brought. Indignation and jealous sensitiveness are swallowed up in the overflowing thankfulness to which those tidings had given birth at the time, and which were now renewed.<p><span class= "bld">I have said before . . .</span>--He had not used the form of expression before, as far as this letter is concerned, but the fact was implied in what he had said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2Corinthians 6:11</a> : "Our heart is enlarged." The words that follow are partly an almost proverbial expression for strong attachment, as in Horace (<span class= "ital">Odes,</span> iii. 9): "Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens"--<p>"With thee I fain would live,<p>With thee I fain would die;"<p>partly with a profounder meaning, that, whether in death or life (the order of the words throws us back on "dying, but behold, we live," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2Corinthians 6:9</a>), his heart and prayers would be with them and for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak not this to condemn you.</span> "Not by way of condemnation am I speaking." My object is to maintain the old love between us; what I say, therefore, is merely to defend myself, not to complain of you (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have said before.</span> He has not said it in so many words, but has implied it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-11.htm">2 Corinthians 6:11-14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are in our hearts.</span> So he says to his beloved Philippians, "I have you in my heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm">Philippians 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To die and live with you.</span> Similarly he tells the Thessalonians that he was ready to give them even his own life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>). This is no mere conventional expression of deep affection, like Horace's, "Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;" nor is it the description of some compact for life and death like that of the Theban Band. It has the deeper meaning which was involved by the words "life" and "death" on the lips of a Christian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-11.htm">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-9.htm">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>). And one whose life was, for Christ's sake, a daily death, naturally mentions death first. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-4 The promises of God are strong reasons for us to follow after holiness; we must cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit. If we hope in God as our Father, we must seek to be holy as he is holy, and perfect as our Father in heaven. His grace, by the influences of his Spirit, alone can purify, but holiness should be the object of our constant prayers. If the ministers of the gospel are thought contemptible, there is danger lest the gospel itself be despised also; and though ministers must flatter none, yet they must be gentle towards all. Ministers may look for esteem and favour, when they can safely appeal to the people, that they have corrupted no man by false doctrines or flattering speeches; that they have defrauded no man; nor sought to promote their own interests so as to hurt any. It was affection to them made the apostle speak so freely to them, and caused him to glory of them, in all places, and upon all occasions.</body></html>
