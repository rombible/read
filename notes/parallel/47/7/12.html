All other inter pretations--such as those which make St. Paul or the community the injured party--are fantastic. But in what sense was the father injured? The union was a marriage, not a mere concubinage or adultery (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1</a>), and it could not have been so unless the first marriage had been dissolved by a divorce. But if the husband had divorced the wife, then, though the son's marriage may have shocked men as immoral, the father could hardly be said to have suffered a wrong to which he had exposed himself by his own act. The probable explanation is found in supposing that the wife, seduced by her step-son or seducing him, had divorced herself. Wives had this power under Roman law; and it was used with such license under the Empire, that Juvenal speaks of one woman of rank who had--<p>"Eight husbands in five autumns. Do you laugh?<p>The thing reads well upon an epitaph."<span class= "ital">--Sat. vi.</span> 230.<p>On this assumption the father had, of course, sustained a very grievous wrong. There is an obvious tone of impatience, almost of annoyance, in the way in which St. Paul speaks of the whole business. It was one of those scandals in which, though it had been necessary to assert the law of purity and enforce the discipline of the Church, he could not bring himself at the time to feel any special interest in either of the parties. Afterwards, when the sinner was repentant, there came, it is true, a new feeling of pity for him, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2Corinthians 2:6-8</a>. But when he wrote, it was with a larger aim, to show them how much he cared for his disciples at Corinth, how jealous he was to clear away any stains that affected their reputation as a Church. It is noticeable that no mention is made of the woman's repentance, nor, indeed, of her coming, in any way, under the discipline of the Church. The facts of the case suggest the conclusion that both husband and wife were heathens, and that the son was the only convert of the family. In this case we may fairly assume that she had played the part of temptress, and that his conscience, though weak, had been the more sensitive of the two. On this view the exhortations against being "unequally yoked together" with unbelievers gains a fresh significance. Possibly some idolatrous festival had furnished the first opportunity of sin, and so the fact gave special protest against any attempt to combine the worship of Christ with that of Belial.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, though I wrote unto you.</span> "So then, even if I <span class="accented">did</span> write you," namely, about that matter. <span class="cmt_word">For his cause that had done the wrong,</span> etc. My object in writing was not to mix myself up with the personal quarrel.

The Sinaitic manuscript has "your care for yourselves." The variations have partly risen from the apparent strangeness of the remark that his letter had been written in order that their care for him might be manifested <span class="accented">to themselves</span>; in other words, that they might learn from their own conduct the reality of their earnest feelings for him. He has already spoken of this "earnest care" of theirs (ver. 11), but not in quite the same sense. Certainly, however, the reading followed by our Authorized Version, even if it be a correction, furnishes a more natural meaning (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>), and the other may have arisen from a clerical error. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:12-16 The apostle was not disappointed concerning them, which he signified to Titus; and he could with joy declare the confidence he had in them for the time to come.
