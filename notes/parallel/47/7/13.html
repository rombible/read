The messenger had shown himself to be his true son in the faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">His spirit</span> <span class= "bld">was refreshed.</span>--Better, as expressing the permanence of the effect, <span class= "ital">has been refreshed.</span> The term was a favourite one with the writer. Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus had "refreshed" his spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-18.htm" title="For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge you them that are such.">1Corinthians 16:18</a>. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a>). The primary idea of the word is, however, rather that of "giving <span class= "ital">rest"</span> to the weary, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-45.htm" title="Then comes he to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.">Matthew 26:45</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore we were comforted,</span> etc. Since my Epistle secured the result of manifesting your true feelings towards me, "we have been comforted." The Revised Version and many editions put the stop here, and continue (reading <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>), <span class="accented">and in addition to our consolation, abundantly the more did we rejoice at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Exceedingly the more.</span> In the Greek this is expressed by double comparatives (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Was refreshed;</span> rather, <span class="accented">has been</span> (<span class="accented">and is</span>) <span class="accented">refreshed</span>. The same verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-18.htm">1 Corinthians 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7, 20</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:12-16 The apostle was not disappointed concerning them, which he signified to Titus; and he could with joy declare the confidence he had in them for the time to come. Here see the duties of a pastor and of his flock; the latter must lighten the troubles of the pastoral office, by respect and obedience; the former make a due return by his care of them, and cherish the flock by testimonies of satisfaction, joy, and tenderness.</body></html>
