Possibly, he had been spoken of as a man of "unknown" or obscure antecedents, and his answer to that taunt is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-13.htm" title="For we write none other things to you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;">2Corinthians 1:13-14</a>, that where he was known at all he was <span class= "ital">recognised</span> as being what indeed he was. He could show even to them, to some of them at least, whether it were not so. In "dying, and, behold, we live" we may trace a reference partly to the "sentence of death" which had, as it were, been passed upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead:">2Corinthians 1:9</a>), partly to the malignant exultation with which that fact had been received, or was likely, he thought, to be received by those who hated him. We can picture them as saying, "His course will soon be over; he will not trouble us long;" and his answer to that imagined sneer is that he is still in full energy. What has befallen him has been a chastening and a discipline, but he is not yet, as they fondly thought, "killed" and delivered over unto death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As unknown;</span> literally, <span class="accented">as being ignored</span>; <span class="accented">as those whom no one cares to recognize</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And yet well known.</span> "And becoming fully recognized."

The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.</body></html>
