In the general state of morals throughout the empire, and especially in writing to such a city as Corinth, it was natural to dwell on this aspect of the Christian character. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.">1Corinthians 7:7</a>.)

In "kindness" we trace the consciousness of an effort to reproduce the graciousness which he looked on as a characteristic attribute of God and Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm" title="But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,">Titus 3:4</a>). In the "Holy Ghost" we may see a reference both to spiritual gifts, such as those of tongues and prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-18.htm" title="I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:">1Corinthians 14:18-19</a>), and to the impulses and promptings in which he traced the general guidance of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6-7</a>). "Love unfeigned" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> without hypocrisy) presents the same combination as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-9.htm" title="Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; hold to that which is good.">Romans 12:9</a> ("without dissimulation" in the English version).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By pureness;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in pureness</span>, as the preposition is the same. He now gives six instances of special gifts and virtues. The "pureness" is not only "chastity," but absolute sincerity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By knowledge</span>. The knowledge is the true knowledge of the gospel in its fulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4</a>). In his depth of insight into the truth St. Paul was specially gifted. The word <span class="accented">gnosis</span> had not yet acquired the fatal connotations which afterwards discredited it. <span class="cmt_word">By long suffering</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>). The patient endurance of insults, of which St. Paul shows a practical specimen in this Epistle, and still more in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15-18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">By kindness.</span> "Love suffereth long, and is kind" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>); "Long suffering, kindness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the Holy Ghost.</span> To the special gift of the Spirit St. Paul attributed all his success (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By love unfeigned;</span> which is the surest fruit of the Spirit, and the best of all spiritual gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-15.htm">2 Corinthians 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.</body></html>
