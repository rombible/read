Did men say of him, as others had said of the saints of God before him, that he was "smitten of God, and afflicted"? Was it with him, as with David, that when he wept, that "was turned to his reproof"? that when he "made sackcloth his garment" he "became a proverb unto them"? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/69-10.htm" title="When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.">Psalm 69:10-11</a>.) This seems, on the whole, the most probable explanation of the words. His Jewish rivals, or the jesters of Corinth, taunted him with his want of cheerfulness, "He was always in trouble." This, at least, enables us to understand the bitterness of spirit in which St. Paul spoke, and to enter into the full force of his answer: "Yea, but with our sorrow there is also the ever-flowing well-spring of joy--a joy not of the world, but of the Holy Ghost."<p><span class= "bld">As poor, yet making many rich.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as a beggar.</span> It is not hard to imagine that the outward circumstances of St. Paul's life, his daily toil as a tent-maker, his accepting gifts from the Church of Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-8.htm" title="I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.">2Corinthians 11:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15</a>), would furnish occasion for some taunting jest. We seem to hear men speaking of him as a "beggar," a "mendicant." "Yes," he answers, "but I am able to make many rich." It is a possible, though perhaps not altogether an adequate, explanation of the words to see in them a reference to the fact that out of his "poverty" he was able to supply the necessities of others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>). We must, at all events, think of his words as including something more than this, and reminding the Corinthians that he had made many rich with the unsearchable riches of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">As having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</span>--The series of paradoxes culminates in this. In language which has found echoes in the thoughts of sages, saints, mystics, he utters the truth that in the absolute surrender of the thought of calling anything its own the soul becomes the heir of the universe. All things are his, as with the certainty of an assured inheritance. The beatitude of the meek, of those who claim nothing, is that they "shall inherit the earth," and so all things are theirs--the forces of nature, and the changes and chances of life--for all are working together for their good. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm" title="Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.">Matthew 5:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing</span>. The early Christians always insist on "joy" as one of the fruits of the Spirit (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>), and especially joy in the midst of grief and anguish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>, "Rejoice always"). The best proof that this was no mere phraseology, but an amazing and new <span class="accented">charism</span> granted to the world, may be seen in the Epistle to the Philippians. It was written when St. Paul was old, poor, deserted, imprisoned, in danger of immediate death. and apparently in the lowest deeps of forsakes sorrow; vet the spontaneous keynote of the whole Epistle is, "I rejoice; rejoice ye" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As poor.</span> The word means even "<span class="accented">paupers</span>," and describes a very literal fact. St. Paul, for Christ's sake, had suffered "the loss of all things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet making many rich.</span> Not by getting collections for them (which would be a most unworthy antithesis, though it is strangely accepted by Chrysostom and others); but "by imparting to them the true riches, in the form of spiritual gifts, and the teaching of the gospel" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>). Possessing all things; rather, <span class="accented">as having nothing, and fully having all things</span>. The verb means "possessing all things to the full." For "all things are ours" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21, 22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.</body></html>
