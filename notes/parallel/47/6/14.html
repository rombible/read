The under-current of thought is, however, not difficult to trace. There was a false latitude as well as a true. The baser party at Corinth might think it a matter of indifference whether they married a heathen or a Christian, whether they chose their intimate friends among the worshippers of Aphrodite or of Christ. Against that "enlargement" the Apostle feels bound to protest. The Greek word for "unequally yoked together" is not found elsewhere, and was probably coined by St. Paul to give expression to his thoughts. Its meaning is, however, determined by the use of the cognate noun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm" title="You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle engender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come on you.">Leviticus 19:19</a> ("Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with <span class= "ital">a diverse kind</span>"). Cattle were unequally yoked together when ox and ass were drawing the same plough (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-10.htm" title="You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>). Men and women are so when they have no common bond of faith in God. Another explanation refers the image to the yoke of a balance, or pair of scales, and so sees in the precept a warning against partiality in judgment; but this rests on very slender ground, or rather, no ground at all.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.</span> Ewald, followed by Dean Stanley, Holsten, and others, thinks that here there is a sudden dislocation of the argument, and some have even supposed that the section, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1</a>, is either an after thought written by the apostle on the margin of the Epistle after it was finished; or even an interpolation. The latter view has arisen from the unusual expressions of the section, and the use of the word "Belial," and the command of Greek shown by the varied expressions. There is no adequate ground for these conjectures. Every writer is conscious of moods in which words come to him more fluently than at other times, and all writers of deep feeling, like St. Paul, abound in sudden transitions which correspond to the lightning-like rapidity of their thoughts. It is doubtful whether the readers would not have seen at once the sequence of thought, which depends on circumstances which we can only conjecture. Probably the alienation from St. Paul had its root in some tampering with unbelievers. Such might at any rate have been the case among the Gentile members of the Church, some of whom were even willing to go to sacrificial feasts in heathen temples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8-10</a>.). "Unequally yoked" is a metaphor derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>, and is the opposite of "<span class="accented">true yoke fellow"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What fellowship;</span> literally, <span class="accented">participation</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unrighteousness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">lawlessness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>). It was a special mark of heathen life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-19.htm">Romans 7:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Light with darkness.</span> This antithesis is specially prominent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9-11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 13</a>, and in the writings of St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; 1 John, <span class="accented">passim</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-18 It is wrong for believers to join with the wicked and profane. The word unbeliever applies to all destitute of true faith. True pastors will caution their beloved children in the gospel, not to be unequally yoked. The fatal effects of neglecting Scripture precepts as to marriages clearly appear. Instead of a help meet, the union brings a snare. Those whose cross it is to be unequally united, without their wilful fault, may expect consolation under it; but when believers enter into such unions, against the express warnings of God's word, they must expect must distress. The caution also extends to common conversation. We should not join in friendship and acquaintance with wicked men and unbelievers. Though we cannot wholly avoid seeing and hearing, and being with such, yet we should never choose them for friends. We must not defile ourselves by converse with those who defile themselves with sin. Come out from the workers of iniquity, and separate from their vain and sinful pleasures and pursuits; from all conformity to the corruptions of this present evil world. If it be an envied privilege to be the son or daughter of an earthly prince, who can express the dignity and happiness of being sons and daughters of the Almighty?</body></html>
