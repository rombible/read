Yes, he does commend himself; but how? He looks back on his life of labour and sufferings and challenges comparison. Can others, with their letters of commendation, point to anything like this? The word "ministers" in the Greek is in the nominative case, while the English at least suggests that it is in the objective after the verb. What he means is that he, as the minister of God should do, commends himself by acts and not by words. It is obvious that what follows was likely to expose him to a repetition of the cynical sneer, but of this his generous indignation makes him nobly regardless.<p><span class= "bld">In much patience . . .</span>--Better, as elsewhere, <span class= "ital">endurance.</span> The word has a much stronger meaning than our English "patience." (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm" title="But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.">Luke 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>.) The general term is naturally followed by a specification of details. It is not, perhaps, easy to specify what he refers to under each head. Possibly he used such words, as we habitually use them, without a formal classification. The root-idea of the first word of the triad is that of being pressed upon; of the second, that of a constraint that leaves no choice of action; of the third, that of being so hemmed in that there is no room to move.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Approving ourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">commending ourselves</span>, He is again referring to the insinuation, which had evidently caused him deep pain, that he was not authorized to preach, as his Judaic opponents were, by "letters of commendation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1-3</a>) from James or from the ciders at Jerusalem.

The article should be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">In much patience.</span> Christ had forewarned his apostles that they would have much to endure, and had strengthened them by the promise that "he that endureth to the end shall be saved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In afflictions.</span> This word, as we have seen, is one of the haunting words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4-11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In necessities.</span> St, Paul was poor, and was often in want (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In distresses.</span> The same word which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>. It means "extreme pressure" (literally, <span class="accented">narrowness of space</span>), and is a climax of the other words. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.</body></html>
