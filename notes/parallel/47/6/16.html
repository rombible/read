His mind travels back to the controversy about things sacrificed to idols. Was there not a risk that what he had said about "width" and "expansion" of feeling would be perverted by those who claimed the right to sit at an idol's feast even in the precincts of the idol's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1Corinthians 8:10</a>)? Against that perversion he thinks it necessary to enter his protest. And the ground of that protest is that they, collectively and individually (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>), are the temples of God, and that there can be no "agreement" between that temple and one dedicated to an idol. The word translated "agreement" expresses, like the English, a compact or treaty of alliance. In modern phrase, a <span class= "ital">concordat</span> between the two antagonistic systems was an impossibility.<p><span class= "bld">I will dwell in them, and walk in them.</span>--The citation which follows is, like many others in St. Paul's writings, a composite one: <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-12.htm" title="And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people.">Leviticus 26:12</a> giving, "I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45</a>, "I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God." The implied premise is that wherever God dwells there is His temple. The word indicates the "sanctuary," or holiest part of the temple. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What agreement.</span> The word means "unity of composition."

The word unbeliever applies to all destitute of true faith. True pastors will caution their beloved children in the gospel, not to be unequally yoked. The fatal effects of neglecting Scripture precepts as to marriages clearly appear. Instead of a help meet, the union brings a snare. Those whose cross it is to be unequally united, without their wilful fault, may expect consolation under it; but when believers enter into such unions, against the express warnings of God's word, they must expect must distress. The caution also extends to common conversation. We should not join in friendship and acquaintance with wicked men and unbelievers. Though we cannot wholly avoid seeing and hearing, and being with such, yet we should never choose them for friends. We must not defile ourselves by converse with those who defile themselves with sin. Come out from the workers of iniquity, and separate from their vain and sinful pleasures and pursuits; from all conformity to the corruptions of this present evil world. If it be an envied privilege to be the son or daughter of an earthly prince, who can express the dignity and happiness of being sons and daughters of the Almighty?</body></html>
