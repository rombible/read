The Hebrew word signifies "vileness, worthlessness;" and the "sons of Belial" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-13.htm" title="Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-12.htm" title="Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.">1Samuel 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-17.htm" title="Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.">1Samuel 25:17</a>) were therefore the worthless and the vile. The English version, following the Vulgate, translates the phrase as though Belial were a proper name, and this has led to the current belief, as shown in Milton's poems, that it was the name of a demon or fallen angel, the representative of impurity--<p>"Belial came last, than whom a spirit more lewd,<p>Fell not from heaven, or more gross to love<p>Vice for itself."--<span class= "ital">Paradise Lost,</span> i. 490.<p>"Belial, the dissolutest spirit that fell,<p>The sensualest, and, after Asmodai,<p>The fleshliest incubus."--<span class= "ital">Paradise Regained,</span> ii. 204.<p>St. Paul's use of the word would seem to imply that some such belief was floating among the Jews in his time. A strange legend, which possibly had a Jewish origin (it is referred to certain <span class= "ital">necromantici</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> is found in an obscure and forgotten book (Wierus: <span class= "ital">Pseudo-Monarchia Daemonum</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> to the effect that Solomon was led by a certain woman to bow before the image of Belial, who is represented as worshipped by the Babylonians. Of that worship there is no trace in history; and Milton seems to have recognised this--<p>"To him no temple stood<p>Nor altar smoked."<p>But if the name had gathered these associations round it, we can understand St. Paul's using it as representing, or, as it were, personifying, the whole system of impure <span class= "ital">cultus</span> that prevailed in the worship of Aphrodite at Corinth.<p><span class= "bld">With an infidel.</span>--So many later associations have gathered round the word, that it may be well to remind the reader that it does not mean, as commonly with us, one who has rejected the faith, but simply one who has not as yet received it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">harmony</span> or <span class="accented">accord</span>. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament or in the LXX. The adjective <span class="accented">sumphonos</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Christ with Belial</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>), <span class="accented">Belial</span>. Here used in the form <span class="accented">Beliar</span>, as a proper name, because no Greek word ends in the letter <span class="greek">&#x3c4;</span>. In the Old Testament it does not stand for a person, but means "wickedness" or "worthlessness." Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a> "a naughty person" is <span class="accented">adam belial</span>. "A son of Belial" means "a child of wickedness" by a common Hebraism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22</a>). And hence, since Belial only became a proper name in later days - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"To him no temples rose,<br />No altars smoked."</span> Perhaps, as has been conjectured, this clause, which contains two such unusual words, may be a quotation. It is, however, no ground of objection that Belial does not occur elsewhere in St. Paul, for until the pastoral Epistles he only uses <span class="accented">diabolos</span> twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-27.htm">Ephesians 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What part,</span> etc.? This is not, like the other clauses, an illustration, but the statement of the fact itself which "has come in amidst the lively, sweeping flow of the discourse." <span class="cmt_word">With an infidel;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with an unconverted Gentile. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-18 It is wrong for believers to join with the wicked and profane. The word unbeliever applies to all destitute of true faith. True pastors will caution their beloved children in the gospel, not to be unequally yoked. The fatal effects of neglecting Scripture precepts as to marriages clearly appear. Instead of a help meet, the union brings a snare. Those whose cross it is to be unequally united, without their wilful fault, may expect consolation under it; but when believers enter into such unions, against the express warnings of God's word, they must expect must distress. The caution also extends to common conversation. We should not join in friendship and acquaintance with wicked men and unbelievers. Though we cannot wholly avoid seeing and hearing, and being with such, yet we should never choose them for friends. We must not defile ourselves by converse with those who defile themselves with sin. Come out from the workers of iniquity, and separate from their vain and sinful pleasures and pursuits; from all conformity to the corruptions of this present evil world. If it be an envied privilege to be the son or daughter of an earthly prince, who can express the dignity and happiness of being sons and daughters of the Almighty?</body></html>
