With the article, the same combination occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2Timothy 2:15</a>; and there can be no doubt that there the sense is objective--"the word which conveys the truth of God to men." Here a subjective meaning, "a word of truthfulness," or "truthful word," as distinct from insincerity of speech, is grammatically possible; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>, where precisely the same combination occurs, we have ample warrant for retaining the objective meaning even here.<p><span class= "bld">By the power of God.</span>--Here, again, the words hover between a general and a specific sense. As distinguished from the "Holy Ghost" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,">2Corinthians 6:6</a>, and looking to the general use of the Greek word for "power," it seems natural to refer the word here chiefly, though, perhaps, not exclusively, to the supernatural power given by God for working miracles. (Comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.">1Corinthians 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:">1Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28-29</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">By the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left.</span>--The thought is found in a more expanded form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1Thessalonians 5:8</a>. Its recurrence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)">2Corinthians 10:4</a> shows how familiar it was to St. Paul's mind. Here it is presented in a more condensed form, but its meaning is sufficiently obvious. The weapon of the right hand is "the sword of the Spirit," aggressive in the conflict with evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>). The armour for the left hand is defensive, the "shield of faith," which is our defence against the fiery darts of the wicked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a>). This gives, it is believed, a better meaning than the interpretation which translates the Greek word by "instruments," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a>, and taking these as meaning opportunities for action, sees in the two adjectives the meaning which sometimes attaches to them in Greek authors, and was derived from the usages of Greek divination, as "favourable" and "unfavourable." It has been urged that the absence of the Greek article before "weapons on the left" is against the distinction which has been drawn above, and therefore that the words refer to the breast-plate which encompasses both sides of the body; but this, though a tenable view grammatically, is somewhat over-subtle. A man dictating a letter under the influence of strong emotion is not always mindful of minute grammatical distinctions, such as that on which this last interpretation rests.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the word of truth.</span> St. Paul now passes to the more specific endowments of the true teacher (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the power of God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in power</span> <span class="accented">of God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-20.htm">1 Corinthians 4:20</a>).

The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.</body></html>
