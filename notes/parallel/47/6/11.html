The rush of thoughts had reached its highest point. He rests, and feels almost as if some apology were needed for so vehement an outpouring of emotion. And now he writes as if personally pleading with them. Nowhere else in the whole range of his Epistles do we find any parallel to this form of speech--this "O ye Corinthians." He has to tell them that he speaks out of the fulness of his heart, that if his mouth has been opened with an unusual freedom it is because his heart has felt a more than common expansion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-18.</span> - <span class="accented">An appeal to the Corinthians to reciprocate his love for them, and separate themselves from evil</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Corinthians</span>! A rare and very personal form of loving appeal, which occurs nowhere else in these Epistles (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Our mouth is open to you.</span> St. Paul has evidently been writing in a mood of inspired eloquence. The fervour of his feelings has found vent in an unusual flow of beautiful and forcible language. He appeals to the unreserved freedom with which he has written as a reason why they should treat him with the same frank love. <span class="cmt_word">Our heart is enlarged.</span> After writing the foregoing majestic appeal, he felt that he had disburdened his heart, and as it were made room in it to receive the Corinthians unreservedly, in spite of all the wrongs which some of them had done him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-3.htm">2 Corinthians 7:3</a>, 27). On the antithesis of the <span class="accented">mouth</span> and the <span class="accented">heart</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-10.htm">Romans 10:10</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-18 It is wrong for believers to join with the wicked and profane. The word unbeliever applies to all destitute of true faith. True pastors will caution their beloved children in the gospel, not to be unequally yoked. The fatal effects of neglecting Scripture precepts as to marriages clearly appear. Instead of a help meet, the union brings a snare. Those whose cross it is to be unequally united, without their wilful fault, may expect consolation under it; but when believers enter into such unions, against the express warnings of God's word, they must expect must distress. The caution also extends to common conversation. We should not join in friendship and acquaintance with wicked men and unbelievers. Though we cannot wholly avoid seeing and hearing, and being with such, yet we should never choose them for friends. We must not defile ourselves by converse with those who defile themselves with sin. Come out from the workers of iniquity, and separate from their vain and sinful pleasures and pursuits; from all conformity to the corruptions of this present evil world. If it be an envied privilege to be the son or daughter of an earthly prince, who can express the dignity and happiness of being sons and daughters of the Almighty?</body></html>
