The words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;">Isaiah 49:8</a>) are among those addressed at first to the servant of Jehovah, as "the light of the Gentiles;" then, apparently, in His name, as the Holy One, and in that of Jehovah, to Israel as a nation. In God's dealings with His people through Christ the Apostle saw the true fulfilment of Isaiah's words. Never, in spite of all outward calamities, had there been a time so acceptable, a day so full of deliverance.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, now is the accepted time . . .</span>--The word for "accepted" is much stronger than in the previous clause. <span class= "ital">Entirely acceptable</span> is, perhaps, its best equivalent. The solemnity of the words was, it may be, intensified in St. Paul's thoughts by what seemed to him the nearness of the impending judgment. Opportunities, as we should say, were offered which might never again recur. But the prolonged experience of the longsuffering of God has given to the words a yet more profound significance. There is, so to speak, a "now" running through the ages. For each church and nation, for each individual soul, there is a golden present which may never again recur, and in which lie boundless possibilities for the future. The words of the Apostle are, as it were, the transfigured expression of the generalisation of a wide experience which tells us that--<p>"There is a tide in the affairs of men<p>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune:<p>Omitted, all the voyage of their life<p>Is bound in shallows and in miseries."<p>--Shakespeare, <span class= "ital">Julius C?sar,</span> iv. 3.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he saith;</span> that is, "God saith." The nominative is involved in the "<span class="accented">fellow workers</span>,"<span class="accented">so</span> that this is hardly to be classed with those rabbinic methods of citation found also in Philo, which deliberately omit the word "God" as the speaker, and use "He" by preference. <span class="cmt_word">I have heard thee,</span> etc. The quotation is from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, and is meant to express the necessity for receiving the grace of God, not only efficaciously, but at once. The "thee" in Isaiah is the Servant of Jehovah, the type primarily of Christ, and then of all who are "in Christ." <span class="cmt_word">In a time accepted;</span> literally, in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">in a time of favour</span>. It is the season of grace, before grace has been wilfully rejected, and the time for judgment begins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The accepted time;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the well-accepted opportunity</span>. St. Paul in his earnestness strengthens the force of the adjective. The same word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16, 31</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"There is a deep nick in Time's restless wheel<br />For each man's good."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Chapman.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>. No doubt St. Paul meant that, as long as life lasts, the door of repentance is never absolutely closed; but it is probable that he had specially in view the nearness of the advent of Christ. Compare the stress laid upon the word "today" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7, 8</a>, and "at least in this <span class="accented">thy day"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.</body></html>
