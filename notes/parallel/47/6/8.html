We trace once more in the words that follow the sensitiveness of a recent experience. He has to do his work, at one time, as through a <span class= "ital">glory</span> which he has not sought; at another time under an ignominy which he has not deserved. Men at one time speak well of him, and at another he falls upon evil and bitter tongues. The very word "deceiver," most galling of all words to one who is conscious of his truthfulness, is recklessly flung at him. Through all these he goes on his work, believing that in them also he may find a way of commending himself as a minister of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By honour and dishonour;</span> rather, <span class="accented">by glory and dishonour</span>. There is no need to change here the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, "by means of," to "through," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "amid." The honour and dishonor are alike means which contribute to the commendation of the ministry. Of our Lord some said, "He is a deceiver," while others said, "He is a good man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>); and the dispraise of some is the highest praise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>). Compare with the whole passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9-13</a>, where we see that "abuse," "insult," and "slander," constituted no small part of the apostle's daily trial. <span class="cmt_word">By evil report and good report.</span> The beatitude of malediction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>).

This is an illustration of the "evil report," and in the Clementine homilies, a century later, St. Paul, under the disgraceful pseudonym of "Simon Magus," is still defamed as a deceiver. <span class="cmt_word">And yet true.</span> There is no "yet" in the original, and its omission gives more force to these eloquent and impassioned contrasts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.</body></html>
