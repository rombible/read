The language in which he does so is every way significant. Those to whom he wrote had believed and been baptised, and so they had "received the grace;" but the freedom of the will to choose good or evil remained, and if they chose evil they would frustrate the end which the grace was intended to work out. (Comp. the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1Corinthians 15:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We then, as fellow workers.</span> Continuing the entreaty of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>, he adds, "But as [his] fellow workers we also exhort you." The "also" shows that he does not rest content with merely <span class="accented">entreating</span> them (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>), but adds to the entreaty an exhortation emphasized by a self-sacrificing ministry.

"He," says Pelagius, "receives the grace of God in vain who, in the new covenant, is not himself new." If you really are in Christ you must show that you have thereby become "a new creation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). The branches of the true Vine must bear fruit. (For the phrase, "in vain," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>.) What the grace of God is meant to effect is sketched in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11, 12</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.</body></html>
