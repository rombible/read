Here, for the first time, we have the very words quoted. The scorn conveyed in them had wounded the Apostle's sensitive nature like a poisoned arrow; and we have here the nearest approach which the New Testament presents to the passionate complaints poured forth by some of the Psalmists of the Old (Psalms 69, 109). We note the common element of a burning indignation under the sense of wrong. We note also the absence from the Apostle's feelings of the maledictory element which is so prominent in theirs. The "meekness and gentleness of Christ" had not been without their effect in tempering even the most vehement emotions.<p>The great majority of MSS. give the verb in the singular: "For his letters, <span class= "ital">saith he . . .</span>" This may be taken, like the French <span class= "ital">on dit,</span> as used impersonally, and possibly this is the meaning which the English version was intended to convey. The context, however, the definite "such a man as that" of the next verse, is obviously decisive. St. Paul has in his thoughts here, and through the rest of the chapter, one conspicuous antagonist,--the head of a clique and cabal of opponents.<p><span class= "bld">His bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</span>--As with other antithetical epigrams, the sting was found in the tail. It would seem all but incredible that any doubt could ever have been expressed as to the fact that the words point to physical infirmities. They can, indeed, refer to nothing else. For the tradition as to the Apostle's personal appearance, see <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of the Acts of the Apostles. The "contemptible speech" (literally, <span class= "ital">speech of no value; counted as nought</span>) may refer either to a weak or unmusical voice, or to the absence of the rhetorical artifices, the exordium, divisions, perorations, in which Greek audiences delighted. It may be noted that these words give a fresh significance to a remarkable passage in an Epistle written, in the judgment of many critics, within a few weeks of this. "You," he says to the Galatians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13-14</a>), "though I came to you with that infirmity of the flesh which others sneer at, the chronic trial of my life, you did not contemn" (the self-same verb as that used here) "nor loathe me." There is manifestly a contrast present to his thoughts between the mean insults of his rivals at Corinth and the affection which the Galatians had once manifested, and which made their subsequent alienation all the more painful to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say they;</span> literally, <span class="accented">says he</span>. The phrase may, indeed, imply "it is said" (<span class="accented">on dit</span>); but it may refer to one main critic and opponent (comp. vers. 7, 11). Perhaps it would have been wiser and kinder if no one had reported to St. Paul all these subterranean calumnies and innuendoes. <span class="cmt_word">Weighty and strong.</span> This could not be denied, considering the immense effect which had been produced by his first letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His bodily presence is weak.</span> This is usually taken to mean that St. Paul's personal appearance was unprepossessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>). This, indeed, we should infer from many other passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a>:34; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13, 14</a>), and as a natural result of his "stake in the flesh." It is, too, the consistent though late tradition respecting him (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:628). Here, however, the words may mean no more than that "he adds nothing to his cause by being present in person, since he shows vacillation and want of energy." <span class="cmt_word">Contemptible</span>; rather, <span class="accented">despised</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3, 4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:7-11 In outward appearance, Paul was mean and despised in the eyes of some, but this was a false rule to judge by. We must not think that none outward appearance, as if the want of such things proved a man not to be a real Christian, or an able, faithful minister of the lowly Saviour.</body></html>
