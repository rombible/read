The thought of participating in the sin of which the body is the occasion is, however, very close to that of sharing its weakness; and the phrase appears with this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-8.htm" title="So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.">Romans 8:8-9</a>.<p><span class= "bld">We do not war after the flesh.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">we are not carrying on our campaign.</span> See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm" title="And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.">Luke 3:14</a>, where the same word is used. As so often in St. Paul's style, the word--especially any word like this, connected with the soldier's life--becomes the germ of an elaborate figurative imagery, almost of a parable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We walk in the flesh.</span> St. Paul does not disclaim the possession of human infirmities, but maintains that such trials and temptations were not the guiding force of his life. <span class="cmt_word">We do not war after the flesh.</span> His <span class="accented">campaigns</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm">Luke 3:14</a>) were fought with spiritual weapons. The metaphor is a constant one with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-6 While others thought meanly, and spake scornfully of the apostle, he had low thoughts, and spake humbly of himself. We should be aware of our own infirmities, and think humbly of ourselves, even when men reproach us. The work of the ministry is a spiritual warfare with spiritual enemies, and for spiritual purposes. Outward force is not the method of the gospel, but strong persuasions, by the power of truth and the meekness of wisdom. Conscience is accountable to God only; and people must be persuaded to God and their duty, not driven by force. Thus the weapons of our warfare are very powerful; the evidence of truth is convincing. What opposition is made against the gospel, by the powers of sin and Satan in the hearts of men! But observe the conquest the word of God gains. The appointed means, however feeble they appear to some, will be mighty through God. And the preaching of the cross, by men of faith and prayer, has always been fatal to idolatry, impiety, and wickedness.</body></html>
