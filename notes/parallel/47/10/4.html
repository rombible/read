He speaks as if leading an attack on the strong defences of the powers of evil, possibly thinking of the great system of idolatry and impurity enthroned at Corinth and throughout the Empire, possibly of those of pride and obstinate rebellion in the hearts of his individual opponents. The context favours the latter interpretation. It has been suggested (Stanley, <span class= "ital">in loc.</span>) that the Apostle's language may have been coloured by national memories of the wars against the Cilicians carried on by Pompeius, which ended in the reduction of one hundred and twenty fortresses and the capture of more than 10,000 prisoners.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Weapons</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not carnal.</span> He did not rely on the mere "arm of flesh," or on earthly sword or panoply. <span class="cmt_word">Mighty through God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">powerful for God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> powerful for the cause of God, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> powerful in <span class="accented">his</span> estimate. <span class="cmt_word">To the pulling down of strongholds.</span> The word for "pulling down," which implies the entire clearance of an obstacle, is only found in the New Testament in this Epistle (vers. 4, 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>). The word for "strongholds" is found here alone. These "fortresses" were the opposition aroused by factious and hostile partisans, and he hoped to subdue them by the strong exercise of apostolic authority (l Corinthians 4:21; 5:1-5). Dean Stanley suggests a reminiscence of the hundred and twenty <span class="accented">Cilician</span> fortresses pulled down by Pompey; but I think that these general allusions are often pressed too far. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-6 While others thought meanly, and spake scornfully of the apostle, he had low thoughts, and spake humbly of himself. We should be aware of our own infirmities, and think humbly of ourselves, even when men reproach us. The work of the ministry is a spiritual warfare with spiritual enemies, and for spiritual purposes. Outward force is not the method of the gospel, but strong persuasions, by the power of truth and the meekness of wisdom. Conscience is accountable to God only; and people must be persuaded to God and their duty, not driven by force. Thus the weapons of our warfare are very powerful; the evidence of truth is convincing. What opposition is made against the gospel, by the powers of sin and Satan in the hearts of men! But observe the conquest the word of God gains. The appointed means, however feeble they appear to some, will be mighty through God. And the preaching of the cross, by men of faith and prayer, has always been fatal to idolatry, impiety, and wickedness.</body></html>
