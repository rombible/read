When he spoke of "avenging all disobedience," he was not thinking of those to whom he writes, and whose repentance and obedience had filled him with so much joy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2Corinthians 7:6-13</a>), but only of the rebellious remnant. He would wait till all had obeyed who were willing to obey. He does not indicate what form of vengeance he thought of taking, but we may think of some such severe discipline as that indicated by "delivering to Satan," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-20.htm" title="Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.">1Timothy 5:20</a>, with a view, if it were possible, to their ultimate restoration. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2Corinthians 13:3-10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being in a readiness;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> being quite prepared. My sternness of purpose is ready, but my hope is that it may not be called into action. <span class="cmt_word">To revenge;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to do justice upon</span>. In any case, in this infliction of justice, whatever form it might take, he would only be an <span class="accented">agent</span> of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When your obedience is fulfilled.</span> St. Paul is confident that he will overcome the mazes of those opposed to him, and win them to Christ's obedience; but if there were any who should obstinately refuse to submit, they must be reduced to submission by action, not by words. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-6 While others thought meanly, and spake scornfully of the apostle, he had low thoughts, and spake humbly of himself. We should be aware of our own infirmities, and think humbly of ourselves, even when men reproach us. The work of the ministry is a spiritual warfare with spiritual enemies, and for spiritual purposes. Outward force is not the method of the gospel, but strong persuasions, by the power of truth and the meekness of wisdom. Conscience is accountable to God only; and people must be persuaded to God and their duty, not driven by force. Thus the weapons of our warfare are very powerful; the evidence of truth is convincing. What opposition is made against the gospel, by the powers of sin and Satan in the hearts of men! But observe the conquest the word of God gains. The appointed means, however feeble they appear to some, will be mighty through God. And the preaching of the cross, by men of faith and prayer, has always been fatal to idolatry, impiety, and wickedness.</body></html>
