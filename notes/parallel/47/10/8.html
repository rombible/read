The fact that a word could thus possess and dominate over his style and imagination shows how deeply he was moved. The Corinthian Church, with its inflated factions and their fuglemen, recked with beasting, and St. Paul is driven, with utter distaste, to adopt in self-defence language which, to the uncandid and indiscriminating, might seem to wear the same aspect. The word, which is unfrequent in other Epistles, occurs eighteen times in these chapters alone. Other haunting words are "tolerate," "bear with" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11.htm">2 Corinthians 11</a>:l, 4, 19, 20), and "senseless," "fool" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-16.htm">2 Corinthians 11:16, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-6.htm">2 Corinthians 12:6, 11</a>); see note on 2 Corinthians 1:3. <span class="cmt_word">Somewhat more</span>; <span class="accented">something more abundantly</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For edification, and not for your destruction;</span> <span class="accented">for building you up, not pulling you down</span>.
