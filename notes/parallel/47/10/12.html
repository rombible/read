It is, of course, hard to convey the half-playful assonance in English. In "some that commend themselves" we note a reference to the charge of self-commending, which he has already noticed four times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.">2Corinthians 7:11</a>). Before he had defended himself against the charge; now he retorts it on his opponents. In "we dare" we trace a reference to the charge of cowardice, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.">2Corinthians 10:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Measuring themselves by themselves.</span>--The Greek MSS. present many various readings, some of the best MSS. omitting "are not wise, but," and some giving "not boasting" for "we will not boast;" and the Greek text, on any reading, presents a grammatical difficulty, arising from the fact that the last word may be either the third person plural of a verb in the indicative present, or a participle in the dative case, agreeing with "themselves." It is hardly necessary to discuss here the various possible constructions rising out of the combination of these phenomena. The English version gives, it is believed, substantially the meaning of the original. In the very act of saying, with a touch of irony, that he will not compare himself with the rival teachers, the Apostle virtually does compare himself. And the point he makes is that they instituted no such comparison. They were their own standards of excellence. Each was "<span class= "ital">amator sui sine rivali.</span>" Collectively, they formed what has been described in the language of modern literary history as a "Mutual Admiration Society." Of all such self-admiration--one might almost say, of all such <span class= "ital">autolatry</span>--St. Paul declares, what the experience of all ages attests, that they who practise it "are not wise." They lose, as the Greek verb more definitely expresses it, all power of discernment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We dare not.</span> They are in this respect of self-praise much bolder than I. <span class="cmt_word">Make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves;</span> literally, <span class="accented">judge ourselves among or judge ourselves with</span>.

St. Paul is once more rebutting the charge of self-commendation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-11.htm">2 Corinthians 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But they measuring themselves...are not wise.</span> The clause is difficult; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to compare ourselves with others in order to learn what we can and cannot do is usually accounted wise; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> some manuscripts and editions, omitting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, render, "But we ourselves (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>), measuring ourselves by ourselves, and comparing ourselves with ourselves, will not boast above measure;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> some, for <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (they are not wise) read <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (with ourselves, who are not wise). The reading, however, of the Authorized Version is undoubtedly right, and most probably the rendering also. The meaning is that the little cliques of factious religionists, never looking outside their own narrow circles, became inflated with a sense of importance which would have been annihilated if they had looked at higher standards. Hence they thought themselves at liberty to intrude and lay down the law and usurp a claim to infallibility which there was nothing to justify. Such conduct is the reverse of wise. It is a mixture of selfishness, Pharisaism, and conceit, and there have been abundant examples of it among religious parties in all ages. St. Paul, on the other hand, keeps within his own measure, because he has learnt to adopt larger and loftier standards. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-18 If we would compare ourselves with others who excel us, this would be a good method to keep us humble. The apostle fixes a good rule for his conduct; namely, not to boast of things without his measure, which was the measure God had distributed to him. There is not a more fruitful source of error, than to judge of persons and opinions by our own prejudices. How common is it for persons to judge of their own religious character, by the opinions and maxims of the world around them! But how different is the rule of God's word! And of all flattery, self-flattery is the worst. Therefore, instead of praising ourselves, we should strive to approve ourselves to God. In a word, let us glory in the Lord our salvation, and in all other things only as evidences of his love, or means of promoting his glory. Instead of praising ourselves, or seeking the praise of men, let us desire that honour which cometh from God only.</body></html>
