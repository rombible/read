The latter "ye look on things . . ." gives the most satisfactory meaning, as pressing home the charge on which he proceeds to dwell. He has, of course, the party of resistance in his thoughts, but he writes to the whole community, as influenced--some more and some less--by the tendency to attach undue weight to the outward accidents of those who claimed their allegiance rather than to that which was of the essence of all true Apostolic ministry.<p><span class= "bld">If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's . . .</span>--There cannot be the shadow of a doubt that the words refer to those whose watchword was "I am of Christ" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>), who laid claim to some special connection with Him, either as having been His personal disciples, or, at least, as having seen and known Him.

This he proceeds to prove by the fact that he was the founder of their Church (vers. 13-18); that he had always acted with absolute disinterestedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-1.htm">2 Corinthians 11:1-15</a>); that he had lived a life of toil and suffering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-21.htm">2 Corinthians 11:21-33</a>), and that he had received special revelations from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:7-11 In outward appearance, Paul was mean and despised in the eyes of some, but this was a false rule to judge by.
