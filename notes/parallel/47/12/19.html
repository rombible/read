In this case the sentence is better taken as an assertion, not as a question--"You are thinking, and have been thinking for a long time, that it is to you that we have been making our defence." The Greek verb for "excuse," is that which is always used of a formal <span class= "ital">apologia,</span> or vindication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-11.htm" title="And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:">Luke 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-14.htm" title="Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what you shall answer:">Luke 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-10.htm" title="Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, For as much as I know that you have been of many years a judge to this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:">Acts 24:10</a>). St. Paul deprecates the idea that he has any wish to enter on such a vindication. He is anxious to explain his conduct, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2Corinthians 1:15-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2Corinthians 8:20-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?">2Corinthians 11:7-12</a>, but he does not acknowledge that he stands at the bar before their judgment-seat. He speaks, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the same tone of independence as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-3.htm" title="But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.">1Corinthians 4:3-5</a>. The motive which really prompts him to speak as he has spoken is not the wish to clear himself from aspersions, but "before God in Christ,"--under a profound sense that God is his Judge, and that Christ is, as it were, the sphere in which his thoughts revolve,--he is seeking to "edify," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to build them up in the faith or love of God. He has the same end in view in all this perturbed emotion as in the calm liturgical directions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1Corinthians 14:12-26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again, think you that we excuse ourselves unto you?</span> The best reading is not <span class="accented">palin</span>, again, but <span class="accented">palai</span>, long ago. This word with the present is an elegant classical idiom, and means, "You have, perhaps, been imagining all this time that I am pleading with you by way of self-defence. Do not think it! You are no judges of mine. My only object is to speak before God in Christ, not to defend myself since I need no defence so far as you are concerned - but to help in building you up, by removing the falsehoods that alienate you from me." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:11-21 We owe it to good men, to stand up in the defence of their reputation; and we are under special obligations to those from whom we have received benefit, especially spiritual benefit, to own them as instruments in God's hand of good to us. Here is an account of the apostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character of a faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design, to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found among professors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister; and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be tempted to be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the false teachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it is that such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yet thus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days of the apostles.</body></html>
