(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.">2Corinthians 13:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">My God will humble me among you.</span>--We lose the force of the Greek verb by not seeing that it reproduces the word which has been so prominent in the Epistle, and which has appeared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2Corinthians 7:6</a>, as "cast down;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2Corinthians 10:1</a> as "base;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?">2Corinthians 11:7</a> as "abasing." There is something almost plaintive in the tone in which the Apostle speaks of the sin of his disciples as the only real "humiliation" which he has to fear. The readings vary; and one of them may be taken as a question: <span class= "ital">Will God humble me again?</span> There is, however, it is believed, no adequate ground for altering the text.<p><span class= "bld">That I shall bewail many which have sinned already.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">who have sinned beforehand;</span> leaving it uncertain what time is referred to. He may refer to sins before admission into the Church, of which men had never really repented, or to sins before the time of his writing, or before that of his arrival. On the whole, the first interpretation has most to commend it. He has in his thoughts such persons as those described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,">1Corinthians 6:9</a>, and suspects that some of them have not really renounced the sins which he there names. Of the three forms of evil, the first is generic and the two latter more specific; the last probably indicating the darker forms of evil. It is obvious that the words cannot refer to the incestuous offender who had repented (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.">2Corinthians 2:7</a>), nor to the Church generally in connection with that offence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.">2Corinthians 7:9-11</a>). Probably he had in view the party of license, who maintained the indifference of "eating things sacrificed to idols," and of "fornication," just as, in the previous verse, he had chiefly in view the party of his Judaising opponents.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Humble me among you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in my relation to you</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Many which have sinned already, and have not repented;</span> rather, <span class="accented">who have sinned before and did not repent</span>.

Here is an account of the apostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character of a faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design, to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found among professors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister; and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be tempted to be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the false teachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it is that such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yet thus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days of the apostles.</body></html>
