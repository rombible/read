From one point of view, however, it seems infinitely more in harmony with our thoughts of God, that the prayer to be relieved from pain should be refused, because it was working out a higher perfection than was attainable without it, than that a deaf ear should have been turned to a prayer to be relieved from the temptation to impurity. Such a prayer seems to us to carry with it something like an assurance of its own prevailing power. Some of the better MSS. omit the possessive "My," and with that reading the words take the form of a general axiom affirming that, in the highest sense, "might is perfected in weakness." The last word is the same as that translated "infirmity" in the next clause. The variation, as concealing this, is so far unfortunate.<p><span class= "bld">Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities.</span>--The word, as has just been said, is the same as the "weakness" in the answer to his prayer. He finds not comfort only, but actual delight, in his consciousness of weakness, because it is balanced by the sense that the might of Christ <span class= "ital">dwells in him and around him.</span> The word for "rest" is literally, as a like word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>, <span class= "ital">to dwell as in a tent,</span> and suggests the thought that the might of Christ was to him as the Shechinah cloud of glory encompassing him and protecting him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me.</span> The original is much more forcible: "And he <span class="accented">has</span> said to me." <span class="cmt_word">Is sufficient for thee.</span> A similar phrase, though in a very different context, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-26.htm">Deuteronomy 3:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">My strength is made perfect in weakness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3-5</a>). The verse contains a paradox, which yet describes the best history of the world. The paradox becomes more suggestive if, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, D, F, G, we omit "<span class="accented">my</span>." <span class="cmt_word">May rest upon me;</span> literally, <span class="accented">may tabernacle over me</span>.

We are not told what this thorn in the flesh was, whether some great trouble, or some great temptation. But God often brings this good out of evil, that the reproaches of our enemies help to hide pride from us. If God loves us, he will keep us from being exalted above measure; and spiritual burdens are ordered to cure spiritual pride. This thorn in the flesh is said to be a messenger of Satan which he sent for evil; but God designed it, and overruled it for good. Prayer is a salve for every sore, a remedy for every malady; and when we are afflicted with thorns in the flesh, we should give ourselves to prayer. If an answer be not given to the first prayer, nor to the second, we are to continue praying. Troubles are sent to teach us to pray; and are continued, to teach us to continue instant in prayer. Though God accepts the prayer of faith, yet he does not always give what is asked for: as he sometimes grants in wrath, so he sometimes denies in love. When God does not take away our troubles and temptations, yet, if he gives grace enough for us, we have no reason to complain. Grace signifies the good-will of God towards us, and that is enough to enlighten and enliven us, sufficient to strengthen and comfort in all afflictions and distresses. His strength is made perfect in our weakness. Thus his grace is manifested and magnified. When we are weak in ourselves, then we are strong in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; when we feel that we are weak in ourselves, then we go to Christ, receive strength from him, and enjoy most the supplies of Divine strength and grace.</body></html>
