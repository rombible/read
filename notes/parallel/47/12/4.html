Paradise (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.">Luke 23:43</a>) was emphatically the dwelling-place of the souls of the righteous, the reproduction in the unseen world of the lost beauty of the Garden of Eden--the "paradise of joy," as the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-15.htm" title="And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.">Genesis 2:15</a> translates the name. There, flowing about the throne of God, was the fountain of the water of life, and the tree of life growing on its banks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.">Revelation 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1-2</a>). Speculations on the question whether St. Paul thought of it as nearer or farther from earth than the third heaven are obviously idle and profitless. The nearest approach which we can make to an adequate distinction between the two visions is that the first revealed to his gaze the glory of the Throne of God, with angels and archangels round it, and seraphim and cherubim,--a vision like that of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>), and Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>), and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>), and St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/4-2.htm" title="And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.">Revelation 4:2-11</a>)--thoughts like those of Hooker's death-bed (Walton's <span class= "ital">Life</span>)--while the latter brought before his spirit the peace and rest ineffable, even in their intermediate and therefore imperfect state, of the souls who had fallen asleep in Christ and were waiting for their resurrection.<p><span class= "bld">Unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to</span> <span class= "bld">utter.</span>--The first two words present the tone of a paradox--<span class= "ital">speech unspeakable,</span> or <span class= "ital">utterances unutterable.</span> The verb in the second clause hovers between the text, "it is not lawful" and "it is not possible." The hymns which St. John records in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/5-12.htm" title="Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.">Revelation 5:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-12.htm" title="Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be to our God for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm" title="And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of saints.">Revelation 15:3</a>, may give us some faint approach to what dwelt in St. Paul's memory and yet could not be reproduced. Sounds of ineffable sweetness, bursts of praise and adoration, hallelujahs like the sound of many waters, voices low and sweet as those of children, whispers which were scarcely distinguishable from silence and yet thrilled the soul with a rapturous joy--this we may, perhaps, think of as underlying St. Paul's language. In the mystic ecstatic utterances of the Tongues--themselves needing an interpreter, and helping little to build up those who heard them, though they raised the life of those who spoke with them to a higher level--we may, perhaps, trace some earthly echoes of that heavenly music. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1Corinthians 14:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into Paradise.</span> Here, again, we encounter long speculations as to whether Paradise is the same as the third heaven; whether St.,Paul is referring to two visions or two parts of one vision. Such questions are clearly insoluble, and I leave them where I find them. We shall never understand this passage otherwise than in the dim and vague outline in which St. Paul has purposely left it. All that we can know from the New Testament about Paradise must be learnt from this verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>, and it is extremely little. <span class="cmt_word">Unspeakable words.</span> A figure of speech called an oxymoron. Utterances (or "things") incapable of utterance. <span class="cmt_word">Not lawful for a man to utter.</span> How futile, then, must be the attempt to guess what they were, or on what subject! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 There can be no doubt the apostle speaks of himself. Whether heavenly things were brought down to him, while his body was in a trance, as in the case of ancient prophets; or whether his soul was dislodged from the body for a time, and taken up into heaven, or whether he was taken up, body and soul together, he knew not. We are not capable, nor is it fit we should yet know, the particulars of that glorious place and state. He did not attempt to publish to the world what he had heard there, but he set forth the doctrine of Christ. On that foundation the church is built, and on that we must build our faith and hope. And while this teaches us to enlarge our expectations of the glory that shall be revealed, it should render us contented with the usual methods of learning the truth and will of God.</body></html>
