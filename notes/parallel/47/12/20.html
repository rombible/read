He and some of those Corinthians are likely to meet under very unfavourable conditions, neither of them acceptable to the other, severity meeting with open or masked resistance.<p><span class= "bld">Lest there be debates . . . .</span>--The list that follows forms a suggestive parallelism of contrast to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.">2Corinthians 7:11</a>, the ethical imagination of the Apostle, with its keen perception of the shades of human character, dwelling now on the manifold forms of opposition, as before it had dwelt on the manifold fruits of repentance. It will be worth while to attempt to fix the exact significance of each word somewhat more accurately than is done in the Authorised version. "Debates," rather <span class= "ital">strifes</span> or <span class= "ital">quarrels,</span> had in older English a darker shade of meaning than it has now. Men spoke of a "deadly <span class= "ital">debate"</span> between friends. Chapman's <span class= "ital">Homer</span> makes Achilles complain that he has cast his life into "<span class= "ital">debates</span> past end" (<span class= "ital">Iliad,</span> ii. 331). "Envyings" better <span class= "ital">jealousies,</span> another Greek word being appropriated for "envy" in the strict sense. The word, like "jealousy," is capable of a good sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.">2Corinthians 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>. It is well, perhaps, to notice how closely allied are the qualities which the word expresses, how soon "zeal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.">2Corinthians 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm" title="Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.">Philippians 3:6</a>) passes into "jealousy" in a good sense, and that again into "jealousy" in a bad sense. "Wrath." The passion so described is treated by great ethical writers (Aristotle, <span class= "ital">Eth. Nicom.</span> iii. 8) as almost inseparable from true courage. In <span class= "ital">the</span> New Testament it is always used either of human wrath in its evil aspects (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-28.htm" title="And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,">Luke 4:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-28.htm" title="And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-27.htm" title="By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.">Hebrews 11:27</a>), or--but only in the Apocalypse, where it occurs in this sense frequently--of the wrath of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm" title="The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:">Revelation 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-19.htm" title="And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.">Revelation 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-7.htm" title="And one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.">Revelation 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth.">Revelation 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>). There is, therefore, no need to alter the English here. The three words occur in the same connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>, a nearly contemporary Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">Strifes.</span>--The Greek word (<span class= "ital">eritheia</span>) begins with the same three letters as that for "strife," and till a comparatively recent period was supposed to be connected with it, and so to be identical in meaning. It has, however, a very different history, not without interest, even for the English reader. The concrete form of the noun (<span class= "ital">erithos</span>) meets us in Homer and elsewhere as a day-labourer, as in the description of the shield of Achilles:<p>"And there he wrought, a meadow thick with corn,<p>And <span class= "ital">labourers</span> reaping, sickles in their hand."<p><span class= "ital">--Iliad,</span> xviii. 550.<p>The next step in the growth of the word, was the verb "to serve for wages," and this was transferred to those who in matters of state compete for honours and rewards, rather than for their country's good. Aristotle (<span class= "ital">Pol</span> v. 2, ? 6; 3, ? 9) enumerates the fact which the word expresses as one of the causes of revolutions, but carefully distinguishes it from "party spirit," or "faction" as being more directly personal. <span class= "ital">Rivalries</span> would, perhaps, be an adequate rendering, but what are known in political life as the <span class= "ital">cabals</span> of cliques or coteries as contrasted with open party-fights exactly correspond to the evils which the Apostle had in his thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">Backbitings, whisperings.</span>--The English reads the idea of secret calumny into both words. In the Greek, however, the first expresses "open abuse or invective," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-11.htm" title="Speak not evil one of another, brothers. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.">James 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>. In contrast with this we have the "whispers" of the slanderers, the innuendoes and insinuations of the man who has not the courage for the more open attack. So the "whisperer" is spoken of with special scorn in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/21-28.htm" title="A whisperer defileth his own soul, and is hated wheresoever he dwelleth.">Ecclesiasticus 21:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/28-13.htm" title="Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such have destroyed many that were at peace.">Ecclesiasticus 28:13</a>. The word in its primary meaning is used for the low chirp of the swallow, which was, as it were, reproduced in the confidential whispers of the retailer of scandal. (See Note on "babbler" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm" title="Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.">Acts 17:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Swellings, tumults.</span>--The first word is found here only in the New Testament, but is formed regularly from the verb "to be puffed up," which is prominent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.">1Corinthians 4:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1Corinthians 13:4</a>. It was clearly, in St. Paul's mind, the besetting sin of the Corinthians. As far as we know, the word may have been coined by him, but as connected with the medical idea of <span class= "ital">flatus</span> and inflation, it may not improbably have been one of the technical terms, used figuratively, which he borrowed from St. Luke's vocabulary. It is almost necessary to coin an English word to express it. "Inflated egotisms" is an adequate paraphrase: "puffed-upnesses" would be, perhaps, too bold a coinage. The word for "tumult" has met us before. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;">2Corinthians 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-9.htm" title="But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm" title="For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.">1Corinthians 14:33</a>.) <span class= "ital">Disorders, confusions,</span> what figuratively we call the "chaos," into which a public meeting sometimes falls, are what the word expresses, rather than the more open outbreak indicated by "tumult."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Such as ye would not</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Debates</span>.

Here is an account of the apostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character of a faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design, to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found among professors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister; and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be tempted to be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the false teachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it is that such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yet thus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days of the apostles.</body></html>
