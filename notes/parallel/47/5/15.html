It was sufficient to give prominence to the thought that one purpose was that men should share at once His death and His life; should live not in selfishness, but in love; not to themselves, but to Him, as He lived to God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-9.htm" title="Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.">Romans 6:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5-7</a>.) Now we see the full force of "the love of Christ constraineth us," and "we love Him because He first loved us." If He died for us, can we, without shame, frustrate the purpose of His death by not living to Him?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto themselves.</span> That they should live no longer the psychic, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the animal, selfish, egotistic life, but to their risen Saviour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-7.htm">Romans 14:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-15 The apostle quickens himself and others to acts of duty. Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!</body></html>
