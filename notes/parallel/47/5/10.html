It may be noted that it is specially characteristic of this Epistle, in which it occurs nine times. The English version, which can only be ascribed to the unintelligent desire of the translators to vary for the sake of variation, besides being weak in itself, hinders the reader from seeing the reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a>, or even the connection with the "made manifest" in the next verse.<p><span class= "bld">Before the judgment seat of Christ.</span>--The Greek word shows the influence of Roman associations. In the Gospels the imagery of the last judgment is that of a king sitting on his <span class= "ital">throne</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a>), and the word is the ever-recurring note of the Apocalypse, in which it occurs forty-nine times. Here the judgment-seat, or <span class= "ital">bema,</span> is the tribunal of the Roman magistrate, raised high above the level of the <span class= "ital">basilica,</span> or hall, at the end of which it stood. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-19.htm" title="When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.">Matthew 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-21.htm" title="And on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne, and made an oration to them.">Acts 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>.) The word was transferred, when basilicas were turned into churches, to the throne of the bishop, and in classical Greek had been used, not for the judge's seat, but for the orator's pulpit.<p><span class= "bld">That every one may receive the things done in his body.</span>--It would have seemed almost impossible, but for the perverse ingenuity of the system-builders of theology, to evade the force of this unqualified assertion of the working of the universal law of retribution. No formula of justification by faith, or imputed righteousness, or pardon sealed in the blood of Christ, or priestly absolution, is permitted by St. Paul to mingle with his expectations of that great day, as revealing the secrets of men's hearts, awarding to each man according to his works. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.">Galatians 6:7</a>) was to him an eternal, unchanging law. The revelation of all that had been secret, for good or evil; the perfectly equitable measurement of each element of good or evil; the apportionment to each of that which, according to this measurement, each one deserves for the good and evil which he has done: that is the sum and substance of St. Paul's eschatology here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a>. At times his language seems to point to a yet fuller manifestation of the divine mercy as following on that of the divine righteousness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm" title="For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.">Romans 11:32</a>. At times, again, he speaks as if sins were washed away by baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1Corinthians 6:11</a>), or forgiven freely through faith in the atoning blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>); as though the judgment of the great day was anticipated for all who are in Christ by the absence of an accuser able to sustain his charge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>), by the certainty of a sentence of acquittal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm" title="There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:1</a>). If we ask how we can reconcile these seeming inconsistencies, the answer is, that we are not wise in attempting to reconcile them by any logical formula or ingenious system. Here, as in other truths of the spiritual life--God's foreknowledge and man's free-will, God's election and man's power to frustrate it, God's absolute goodness and the permission of pain and evil--the highest truth is presented to us in phases that seem to issue in contradictory conclusions, and we must be content to accept that result as following from the necessary limitations of human knowledge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We must all appear;</span> rather, for <span class="accented">it is necessary that we must all be made manifest</span>; that we must be shown in our real nature and character. The verb is not the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a>, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> The special final judgment is represented as taking place before the <span class="accented">bema</span> of Christ, although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a> the best reading is "of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31, 32</a>). St. Paul might naturally use this Roman and Greek idea of the <span class="accented">bema</span>, being too familiar with it in his own experience (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-6.htm">Acts 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The things done in the body;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the things</span> (<span class="accented">done</span>) <span class="accented">by the instrumentality of the body</span>. Another reading (which only differs by a single letter from this) is, "the proper things of the body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the things which belong to it, which it <span class="accented">has made its own</span>. St. Paul, always intent on one subject at a time, does not stop to coordinate this law of natural retribution and inexorable Nemesis with that of the "forgiveness of sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), or with the apparently universal hopes which he seems sometimes to express (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-17.htm">Romans 5:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>). <span class="accented">Omnia exeunt in mysterium</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>According to that he hath done;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with reference to the things he did</span>. The aorist shows that all life will be as it were concentrated to one point. The Pelagians raised questions on this verse about the sinlessness of infants, etc., all of which may be left on one side, as probably nothing was more absolutely distant from the thoughts of St. Paul. Observe that each is to receive the natural issues of what he has done. There is to be an analogy between the sin and the retribution. The latter is but the ripe fruit of the former. We shall be punished by the action of natural laws, not of arbitrary inflictions. We shall reap what we have sown, not harvests of other grain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whether it be good or bad.</span> St. Paul, who always confines himself to one topic at a time, does not here enter on the question of the cutting off of the entailed curse by repentance and forgiveness. He leaves unsolved the antinomy between normal inevitable consequence and free remission. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-15 The apostle quickens himself and others to acts of duty. Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!</body></html>
