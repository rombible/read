St. Paul's uniform use of this and like phrases, however, elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-35.htm" title="Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?">Romans 8:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-24.htm" title="My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.">1Corinthians 16:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-14.htm" title="The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.">2Corinthians 13:14</a>), is decisive in favour of the former. It was the Apostle's sense of the love that Christ had shown to him and to all men that was acting as a constraining power, directing every act of every spiritual state to the good of others, restraining him from every self-seeking purpose.<p><span class= "bld">Because we thus judge, that if one died for all.</span>--Better, as expressing the force of the Greek tense, <span class= "ital">Because we formed this judgment.</span> The form of expression implies that the conviction dated from a given time, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> probably, from the hour when, in the new birth of his conversion, he first learnt to know the universality of the love of Christ manifested in His death. Many MSS. omit the "if," but without any real change of meaning. It is obvious that St. Paul assumes the fact, even if it be stated hypothetically. The thought is the same as in the nearly contemporary passage of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15-19</a>, and takes its place among St. Paul's most unqualified assertions of the universality of the atonement effected by Christ's death. The Greek preposition does not in itself imply more than the fact that the death was <span class= "ital">on behalf of all;</span> but this runs up--as we see by comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-24.htm" title="And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.">Mark 14:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-13.htm" title="Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.">John 15:13</a>--into the thought that the death was, in some very real sense, vicarious: <span class= "ital">in the place of</span> the death of all men. The sequence of thought involves that meaning here.<p><span class= "bld">Then were all dead.</span>--These strange, mysterious words have received very different interpretations. They cannot be rightly understood without bearing in view what we may call the <span class= "ital">mystic</span> aspect of one phase of St. Paul's teaching. We may, perhaps, clear the way by setting aside untenable expositions. (1) They cannot mean, however true the fact may be in itself, that the death of Christ for all showed that all were previously under a sentence of condemnation and of death, for the verb is in the tense which indicates the momentary act of dying, not the state of death. (2) They cannot mean, for the same reason, that all were, before that sacrifice, "<span class= "ital">dead</span> in trespasses and sins." (3) They can hardly mean that all men, in and through that death, paid vicariously the penalty of death for their past sins, for the context implies that stress is laid not on the satisfaction of the claims of justice, but on personal union with Christ. The real solution of the problem is found in the line of thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17-19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm" title="For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.">1Corinthians 15:22</a>, as to the relation of Christ to every member of the human family, in the teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a>, as to the meaning of His death--("He died unto sin once"). "Christ died for all"--this is the Apostle's thought--"as the head and representative of the race." But if so, the race, in its collective unity, died, as He died, to sin, and should live, as He lives, to God. Each member of the race is then only in a true and normal state when he ceases to live for himself and actually lives for Christ. That is the mystic ideal which St. Paul placed before himself and others, and every advance in holiness is, in its measure, an approximation to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The love of Christ.</span> It matters little whether this be interpreted as a subjective genitive, "Christ's love to man," or as an objective genitive, our love to Christ;" for the two suppose and interfuse each other. St. Paul's usage, however, favours the former interpretation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-14.htm">2 Corinthians 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-24.htm">1 Corinthians 16:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Constraineth</span>. The word means that it compresses us, and therefore keeps us irresistibly to one object (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-50.htm">Luke 12:50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That if one died for all, then were all dead.</span> This is an unfortunate mistranslation and wrong reading for <span class="accented">that one died for all, therefore all died</span>. What compels Paul to sacrifice himself to the work of God for his converts is the conviction, which he formed once for all at his conversion, that One, even Christ, died on behalf of all men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-19</a>) a redeeming death (ver. 21); and that, consequently, in that death, all <span class="accented">potentially</span> died with him - died to their life of sin, and rose to the life of righteousness. The best comments on this bold and concentrated phrase are - "I died to the Law that I might live to Christ;" "I have been <span class="accented">crucified with Christ"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); and, "Ye died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>). When Christ died, all humanity, of which he was the federal Head, died potentially with him to sin and selfishness, as he further shows in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-15 The apostle quickens himself and others to acts of duty. Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!</body></html>
