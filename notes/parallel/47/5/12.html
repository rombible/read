In reality, however, what follows is more intelligible without it. He has scarcely uttered the words that precede this sentence when the poison of the barbed arrow of the sneer to which he had referred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a> again stings him. He hears his enemies saying, "So he is commending himself again;" and these words are the answer to that taunt. "No," he says, "it is not so, but in appealing to the witness of the work done in your consciences we give you an 'occasion' (or <span class= "ital">starting-point</span>) of a boast which we take for granted that you, the great body of the Church of Corinth, will be ready to make for us."<p><span class= "bld">That ye may have somewhat to answer.</span>--The opponents, of whom we are to hear more hereafter (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance?

"That such as these should be boasting of <span class= "ital">their</span> work and <span class= "ital">their</span> success!" What did they glory in? <span class= "ital">In appearance.</span> The words may apply to anything external--claims of authority, training, knowledge, and the like.

"Take your stand," he seems to say, "against that boast, on the work done by us in your consciences."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we commend not ourselves again unto you.</span> Still reverting to the charge that he was guilty of self praise, he says that his object is not this, for it was needless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But give you occasion to glory on our behalf.</span> But we speak as we have done to give you a starling-point for something to boast of on our behalf. He has already said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4</a>) that the teachers and the taught in their mutual affection ought to have some ground for "boasting" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> for speaking with some praise and exultation) of each other. The Corinthians were being robbed of this by the interested lies of St. Paul's opponents, who thought only about outward appearances. This is why no has set forth to them the aim and glory of his ministry. Nothing could be more gentle and forbearing than such a mode of stating his object. Yet for those who were sufficiently finely strung to understand it, there was an almost pathetic irony involved in it. <span class="cmt_word">Which glory in appearance, and not in heart;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in face</span>. The grounds of their boasting, whatever they were, were superficial and external (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm">2 Corinthians 10:7</a>), not deep and sincere. But those who would judge of Paul aright must look into his very heart, and not on his face. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-15 The apostle quickens himself and others to acts of duty. Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!</body></html>
