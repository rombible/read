"The corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things." The <span class= "ital">Wisdom of Solomon,</span> which no writer quotes before Clement of Rome, had probably been but recently written (possibly, as I believe, by Apollos), but St. Paul may well have become acquainted with it.<p><span class= "bld">Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Seeing that we do not seek to put off, but to put on a garment.</span> The thought is that of one who thinks that the Coming of the Lord is near. He wishes, as he expects, to remain till that Coming (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>), to let the incorruptible body supervene on the corruptible, to be changed instead of dying. In this way that which is mortal, subject to death, would be swallowed up of life, as death itself is swallowed up in victory. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-54.htm" title="So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.">1Corinthians 15:54</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we that are,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">for indeed we who are in the tent</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the transitory mortal body. <span class="cmt_word">Do groan.</span> "Oh wretched man that I am I who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Being burdened.</span> "The corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things" (Wisd. 9:15). <span class="cmt_word">Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">since we do not wish to strip off</span> (<span class="accented">our bodily garment</span>) <span class="accented">but to put another garment over it</span>. St. Paul here repudiates the Manichean notion that the body is a disgrace, or in itself the source of evil. He was not like Plotinus, who "blushed that he had a body;" or like St. Francis of Assist, who called his body "my brother the ass;" or like the Cure d'Ars, who (as we have said) spoke of his body as "ce cadavre." He does not, therefore, desire to get rid of his body, but to "clothe it over" with the garment of immortality. Incidentally this implies the wish that he may be <span class="accented">alive</span> and not <span class="accented">dead</span> when the Lord returns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-35.htm">1 Corinthians 15:35-54</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mortality</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the mortal</span>; <span class="accented">that which is mortal</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Might be swallowed up of life.</span> As in the case of Enoch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>) and Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), who entered into life otherwise than through "the grave and gate of death." St. Paul wishes to enter the "building from God" without having been first buried in the collapse of the "soul's dark cottage battered and decayed." He desires to put on the robe of immortality without stripping off the rent garb of the body. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The believer not only is well assured by faith that there is another and a happy life after this is ended, but he has good hope, through grace, of heaven as a dwelling-place, a resting-place, a hiding-place. In our Father's house there are many mansions, whose Builder and Maker is God. The happiness of the future state is what God has prepared for those that love him: everlasting habitations, not like the earthly tabernacles, the poor cottages of clay, in which our souls now dwell; that are mouldering and decaying, whose foundations are in the dust. The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavy load. But believers groan, being burdened with a body of sin, and because of the many corruptions remaining and raging within them. Death will strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts of life, as well as end all our troubles here below. But believing souls shall be clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness and glory. The present graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests of everlasting grace and comfort. And though God is with us here, by his Spirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as we hope to be. Faith is for this world, and sight is for the other world. It is our duty, and it will be our interest, to walk by faith, till we live by sight. This shows clearly the happiness to be enjoyed by the souls of believers when absent from the body, and where Jesus makes known his glorious presence. We are related to the body and to the Lord; each claims a part in us. But how much more powerfully the Lord pleads for having the soul of the believer closely united with himself! Thou art one of the souls I have loved and chosen; one of those given to me. What is death, as an object of fear, compared with being absent from the Lord!</body></html>
