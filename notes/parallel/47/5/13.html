This also had been said of him, and the intense sensitiveness of his nature made him wince under it. Some there were at Corinth who spoke of his visions and revelations, his speaking with tongues as in ecstasy, his prophecies of future judgment, as so many signs of madness. "He was beside himself." (Comp. Agrippa's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm" title="And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.">Acts 26:24</a>, and Note there.) Others, or, perhaps, the same persons, pointed to his tact, becoming all things to all men, perhaps even insinuated that he was making money by his work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;">2Corinthians 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.">2Corinthians 12:10</a>): "he was shrewd enough when it served his turn." He answers accordingly both the taunts. What people called his "madness"--the ecstasy of adoration, the speaking with tongues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-18.htm" title="I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:">1Corinthians 14:18-23</a>)--that lay between himself and God, and a stranger might not intermeddle with it. What people called his "sober-mindedness"--his shrewd common sense, his sagacity--that he practised not for himself, but for his disciples, to win them to Christ, remove difficulties, strengthen them in the faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For whether we be beside ourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for whether we were mad</span>. Evidently some person or some faction had said of St. Paul, "He is beside himself," just as Festus said afterwards, "Paul, thou art mad," and as the Jews said of Paul's Lord and Master (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm">John 10:20</a>). The fervour of the apostle, his absorption in his work, his visions and ecstasies, his "speaking with tongues more than they all," his indifference to externals, his bursts of emotion, might all have given colour to this charge, which he here ironically accepts. "Mad or self controlled -all was for your sakes." <span class="cmt_word">It is to God;</span> rather <span class="accented">for God</span>. My "enthusiasm," "exaltation," or, if you will, my "madness," was but a phase of my work for him. <span class="cmt_word">We be sober.</span> The word "sober" (<span class="accented">sophron</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> derived from two words which mean" to <span class="accented">save the mind</span>." It indicates wise self control, such as was represented also by the many-sided Latin word <span class="accented">frugi</span>. It is the exact antithesis to madness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-25.htm">Acts 26:25</a>). What you call my "madness" belongs to the relation between my own soul and God; my practical sense and tact are for you. <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for you</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-15 The apostle quickens himself and others to acts of duty. Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!</body></html>
