(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:">2Corinthians 1:8-9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon.</span>--The words have suggested the question whether St. Paul spoke of the "spiritual body" to be received at the resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:">1Corinthians 15:42-49</a>), or of some intermediate stage of being, like that represented in the visions which poets have imagined and schoolmen theorised about, in the visions of the world of the dead in the <span class= "ital">Odyssey</span> (Book 11), in the <span class= "ital">'neid</span> (Book vi.), in Dante's <span class= "ital">Divina Commedia</span> throughout. The answer to that question is found in the manifest fact that the intermediate state occupied but a subordinate position in St. Paul's thoughts. He would not speak overconfidently as to times and seasons, but his practical belief was that he, and most of those who were then living, would survive till the coming of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>). He did not speculate accordingly about that state, but was content to rest in the belief that when absent from the body he would in some more immediate sense, be present with the Lord. But the longing of his soul was, like that of St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.">Revelation 22:20</a>), that the Lord might come quickly--that he might put on the new and glorious body without the pain and struggle of the "dissolution" of the old. In the words "be clothed upon" (literally, the verb being in the middle voice, <span class= "ital">to clothe ourselves, to put on</span>) we have a slight change of imagery. The transition from the thought of a dwelling to that of a garment is, however, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/104-1.htm" title="Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with honor and majesty.">Psalm 104:1-3</a>, sufficiently natural. Each shelters the man. Each is separable from the man himself. Each answers in these respects to the body which invests the spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this we groan.</span> Since we have the firstfruits of the Spirit, who assures us of that future building from God, we, in this earthly tent, "groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit the redemption of our body" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To be clothed upon;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to further clothe ourselves with</span>. Here the metaphors of a tent and a garment - the "wandering tent" and the "mortal vesture of decay" - are interfused in a manner on which only the greatest writers can venture The corruptible yearns to clothe itself with the incorruptible, the mortal with immortality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53</a>). The glorified body is compared to an over garment, <span class="cmt_word">House</span>; rather, <span class="accented">habitation</span> (<span class="accented">oiketerion</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The believer not only is well assured by faith that there is another and a happy life after this is ended, but he has good hope, through grace, of heaven as a dwelling-place, a resting-place, a hiding-place. In our Father's house there are many mansions, whose Builder and Maker is God. The happiness of the future state is what God has prepared for those that love him: everlasting habitations, not like the earthly tabernacles, the poor cottages of clay, in which our souls now dwell; that are mouldering and decaying, whose foundations are in the dust. The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavy load. But believers groan, being burdened with a body of sin, and because of the many corruptions remaining and raging within them. Death will strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts of life, as well as end all our troubles here below. But believing souls shall be clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness and glory. The present graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests of everlasting grace and comfort. And though God is with us here, by his Spirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as we hope to be. Faith is for this world, and sight is for the other world. It is our duty, and it will be our interest, to walk by faith, till we live by sight. This shows clearly the happiness to be enjoyed by the souls of believers when absent from the body, and where Jesus makes known his glorious presence. We are related to the body and to the Lord; each claims a part in us. But how much more powerfully the Lord pleads for having the soul of the believer closely united with himself! Thou art one of the souls I have loved and chosen; one of those given to me. What is death, as an object of fear, compared with being absent from the Lord!</body></html>
