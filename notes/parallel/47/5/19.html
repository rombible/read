The English rendering is tenable grammatically, but the position of the words in the original suggests the construction given above. He seems to emphasise the greatness of the redeeming work by pointing at once to its author and its extent. The structure is the same as the "was preaching" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-44.htm" title="And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.">Luke 4:44</a>. All the English versions, however, from Wiclif downwards, adopt the same construction. Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Geneva version translate, <span class= "ital">making agreement between the world and Himself</span> instead of "reconciling to Himself." The "world" is, of course, the world of men, the "all" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.">2Corinthians 5:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Not imputing their trespasses unto them . . .</span>--The two participial clauses that follow describe the result of the reconciling work. The first is that God no longer charges their transgressions against men: the pronouns being used in the third person plural, as being more individualising than the "world," and more appropriate than would have been the first person, which he had used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18</a>, and which he wanted, in its narrower extension, for the clause which was to follow. The word for "imputing," or <span class= "ital">reckoning,</span> is specially prominent in the Epistles of this period, occurring, though in very varied shades of meaning, eight times in this Epistle and nineteen times in that to the Romans. The difficulty of maintaining a logical coherence of this truth with that of a judgment according to works does not present itself to the Apostle's mind, and need not trouble us. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2Corinthians 5:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</span>--Literally, to maintain the participial construction, <span class= "ital">placing with</span> (or <span class= "ital">in</span>)<span class= "ital"> us the word of reconciliation.</span> Tyndale gives "atonement" here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-11.htm" title="And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.">Romans 5:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.</span> This and the many other passages of Scripture which always represent the atonement as the work of the blessed Trinity, and as being the result of the <span class="accented">love</span>, not of the <span class="accented">wrath</span>, of God, ought to have been a sufficient warning against the hideous extravagance of those <span class="accented">forensic</span> statements of the atonement which have disgraced almost a thousand years of theology (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). That God's purpose of mercy embraced all mankind, and not an elect few, is again and again stated in Scripture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not imputing their trespasses unto them.</span> See this developed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5-8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Hath entrusted unto us;</span> literally, <span class="accented">who also deposited in us</span>, as though it were some sacred treasure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:16-21 The renewed man acts upon new principles, by new rules, with new ends, and in new company. The believer is created anew; his heart is not merely set right, but a new heart is given him. He is the workmanship of God, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Though the same as a man, he is changed in his character and conduct. These words must and do mean more than an outward reformation. The man who formerly saw no beauty in the Saviour that he should desire him, now loves him above all things. The heart of the unregenerate is filled with enmity against God, and God is justly offended with him. Yet there may be reconciliation. Our offended God has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ. By the inspiration of God, the Scriptures were written, which are the word of reconciliation; showing that peace has been made by the cross, and how we may be interested therein. Though God cannot lose by the quarrel, nor gain by the peace, yet he beseeches sinners to lay aside their enmity, and accept the salvation he offers. Christ knew no sin. He was made Sin; not a sinner, but Sin, a Sin-offering, a Sacrifice for sin. The end and design of all this was, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him, might be justified freely by the grace of God through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. Can any lose, labour, or suffer too much for Him, who gave his beloved Son to be the Sacrifice for their sins, that they might be made the righteousness of God in him?</body></html>
