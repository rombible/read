The words that follow give the secret of his calmness and courage in the midst of sufferings. He looks beyond them. A new train of imagery begins to rise in his mind: linked, perhaps, to that of the preceding chapter by the idea of the tabernacle; in part, perhaps, suggested by his own occupation as a tentmaker. His daily work was to him as a parable, and as his hands were making the temporary shelter for those who were travellers on earth, he thought of the house "not made with hands," eternal in the heavens. The comparison of the body to the house or dwelling-place of the Spirit was, of course, natural, and common enough, and, it may be noted, was common among the Greek medical writers (as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in Hippocrates, with whom St. Luke must have been familiar). The modification introduced by the idea of the "tent" emphasises the transitory character of the habitation. "What if the tent be broken up?" He, the true inward man, who dwells in the <span class= "ital">tent</span> will find a more permanent, an eternal, home in heaven: a <span class= "ital">house</span> which comes from God. What follows shows that he is thinking of that spiritual body of which he had said such glorious things in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:">1Corinthians 15:42-49</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> <span class="accented">- The hope of the future rife is the great support of our efforts</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.

Of this tabernacle; literally, <span class="accented">the house of the tent</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tent of our mortality, the mortal body. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm">2 Peter 1:13, 14</a> it is called <span class="accented">skenoma</span>, and the expression, "the Word became flesh and <span class="accented">dwelt</span> among us,"is literally, "he <span class="accented">tabernacled</span> among us" - he wore "a tent like ours and of the same material."

In our Father's house there are many mansions, whose Builder and Maker is God. The happiness of the future state is what God has prepared for those that love him: everlasting habitations, not like the earthly tabernacles, the poor cottages of clay, in which our souls now dwell; that are mouldering and decaying, whose foundations are in the dust. The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavy load. But believers groan, being burdened with a body of sin, and because of the many corruptions remaining and raging within them. Death will strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts of life, as well as end all our troubles here below. But believing souls shall be clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness and glory. The present graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests of everlasting grace and comfort. And though God is with us here, by his Spirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as we hope to be. Faith is for this world, and sight is for the other world. It is our duty, and it will be our interest, to walk by faith, till we live by sight. This shows clearly the happiness to be enjoyed by the souls of believers when absent from the body, and where Jesus makes known his glorious presence. We are related to the body and to the Lord; each claims a part in us. But how much more powerfully the Lord pleads for having the soul of the believer closely united with himself! Thou art one of the souls I have loved and chosen; one of those given to me. What is death, as an object of fear, compared with being absent from the Lord!</body></html>
