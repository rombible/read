"If, as I believe . . .," though not a translation, would be a fair paraphrase. The confident expectation thus expressed is that in the resurrection state the spirit will not be "naked," will have, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> its appropriate garment, a body--clothing it with the attributes of distinct individuality. To the Greek, Hades was a world of shadows. Of Hades, as an intermediate state, St. Paul does not here speak, but he is sure that, in the state of glory which seemed to him so near, there will be nothing shadowy and unreal. The conviction is identical with that expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1Corinthians 15:35-49</a>, against those who, admitting the immortality of the spirit, denied the resurrection of the body.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If so be that.</span> The verse may be rendered, "If, that is, being clothed, we shall not be found naked." The word "naked" must then mean "bodiless," and the reference will be to those whom, at his coming, Christ shall find <span class="accented">clothed in these mortal bodies</span>, and not separated from them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> quick and not dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). This seems to be the simplest and most natural of the multitude of strange interpretations with which the pages of commentators are filled. It is true that the aorist <span class="accented">endusamenoi</span>, means literally, "having clothed ourselves," and that, in taking this meaning, we should have expected the perfect participle <span class="accented">endedumenoi</span>, having been clothed. If this be thought an insuperable difficulty, we must suppose the verse to mean "If, that is, in reality we shall be found [at Christ's coming] after having put on some intermediate body, and therefore not as mere disembodied spirits." But there is no allusion in Scripture to any intermediate body, nor is any gleam of light shed on the mode of life among the dead between death and resurrection, though the Church rejects the dream of Psychopannychia, or an interval of unconscious sleep. The uncertainty of the meaning is increased by two various readings, <span class="accented">ei per</span> instead of <span class="accented">ei ge</span>, which latter expresses greater doubt about the matter; and <span class="accented">ekdusamenoi</span> (D, F, G), which would mean "if in reality, after <span class="accented">unclothing</span> ourselves [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after 'shuffling off this mortal coil'], we shall not be found naked." This seems to be the conjecture of some puzzled copyists, who did not see that a <span class="accented">contrast</span>, and not a coincidence, between the two expressions is intended. If this reading were correct, it would mean, as Chrysostom says, "Even if we would lay aside the body. we shall not there be presented <span class="accented">without a</span> body, but with the <span class="accented">same</span> body which has then become incorruptible." It is quite untenable to make "clothed" mean "clothed <span class="accented">with righteousness</span>," as Olshausen does. In the Talmud, 'Shabbath' (f. 152, 2), the righteous are compared to men who keep from stain the robes given them by a king (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> their bodies), which robes the king deposits in his treasury and sends the wearers away (bodiless) in peace; but foolish servants stain these robes, and the king sends the robes to the wash, and the wearers in prison. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The believer not only is well assured by faith that there is another and a happy life after this is ended, but he has good hope, through grace, of heaven as a dwelling-place, a resting-place, a hiding-place. In our Father's house there are many mansions, whose Builder and Maker is God. The happiness of the future state is what God has prepared for those that love him: everlasting habitations, not like the earthly tabernacles, the poor cottages of clay, in which our souls now dwell; that are mouldering and decaying, whose foundations are in the dust. The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavy load. But believers groan, being burdened with a body of sin, and because of the many corruptions remaining and raging within them. Death will strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts of life, as well as end all our troubles here below. But believing souls shall be clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness and glory. The present graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests of everlasting grace and comfort. And though God is with us here, by his Spirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as we hope to be. Faith is for this world, and sight is for the other world. It is our duty, and it will be our interest, to walk by faith, till we live by sight. This shows clearly the happiness to be enjoyed by the souls of believers when absent from the body, and where Jesus makes known his glorious presence. We are related to the body and to the Lord; each claims a part in us. But how much more powerfully the Lord pleads for having the soul of the believer closely united with himself! Thou art one of the souls I have loved and chosen; one of those given to me. What is death, as an object of fear, compared with being absent from the Lord!</body></html>
