The whole work of God in the past--redemption, the new birth, the gifts and graces of the Spirit--was looking to this as its result. He had given the "earnest of the Spirit" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2Corinthians 1:22</a>) as a pledge of the future victory of the higher life over the lower. Every gift of spiritual energy not dependent upon the material organism was an assurance that that organism was an impediment to the free action of the Spirit, which would one day be overcome. Our eyes, to take a striking instance, are limits, as well as instruments, to the spirit's powers of perception.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He who hath wrought us for the selfsame thing.</span> God prepared and perfected us for this very result, namely, to put on the robe of immortality<span class="cmt_word">. The earnest</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>) The quickening life imparted by the Spirit of life is a pledge and part payment of the incorruptible eternal life. The Spirit is "the Earnest of our inheritance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The believer not only is well assured by faith that there is another and a happy life after this is ended, but he has good hope, through grace, of heaven as a dwelling-place, a resting-place, a hiding-place. In our Father's house there are many mansions, whose Builder and Maker is God. The happiness of the future state is what God has prepared for those that love him: everlasting habitations, not like the earthly tabernacles, the poor cottages of clay, in which our souls now dwell; that are mouldering and decaying, whose foundations are in the dust. The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavy load. But believers groan, being burdened with a body of sin, and because of the many corruptions remaining and raging within them. Death will strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts of life, as well as end all our troubles here below. But believing souls shall be clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness and glory. The present graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests of everlasting grace and comfort. And though God is with us here, by his Spirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as we hope to be. Faith is for this world, and sight is for the other world. It is our duty, and it will be our interest, to walk by faith, till we live by sight. This shows clearly the happiness to be enjoyed by the souls of believers when absent from the body, and where Jesus makes known his glorious presence. We are related to the body and to the Lord; each claims a part in us. But how much more powerfully the Lord pleads for having the soul of the believer closely united with himself! Thou art one of the souls I have loved and chosen; one of those given to me. What is death, as an object of fear, compared with being absent from the Lord!</body></html>
