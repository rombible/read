Tyndale's and Cranmer's versions give, "how the Lord is to be feared;" the Rhemish, "fear." "Terror," characteristically enough, makes its first appearance in the Geneva version.<p><span class= "bld">We persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God.</span>--The antithesis is singularly indicative of the rapid turn of thought in the Apostle's mind. "<span class= "ital">We go on our way of winning men</span> to Christ." (Comp. the use of the same Greek word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm" title="And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.">Acts 12:20</a>, "having made Blastus . . . their friend.") It is singular to note that, in an Epistle probably nearly contemporary with this, St. Paul uses the phrase almost in a bad sense: "Do we now persuade men, or God?" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "Are we seeking to please our friends or God?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>.) And here, apparently, the imperfection of the phrase and its liability to misconstruction occurs to him, and he therefore immediately adds, "Yes, we do our work of persuading men" (the case of Felix, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm" title="And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.">Acts 24:25</a>, may be noted as showing the prominence of "the judgment to come" in St. Paul's method), "but it is all along with the thought that our own lives also have been laid open in their inmost recesses to the sight of God." The word "made manifest" is clearly used in reference to the same word (in the Greek) as is translated "appear" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2Corinthians 5:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</span>--The words are an echo of what had already been said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2Corinthians 4:2</a>. He trusts that in their inmost consciences, in the effect of his preaching there, in the new standard of right and wrong which they now acknowledge--perhaps, also, in the estimate which their illumined judgment passes on his own conduct--he has been made manifest as indeed he is, as he is sure that he will be before the judgment-seat of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-19.</span> <span class="accented">- Self-devotion of the ministry of reconciliation</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.</span> Multitudes of texts have been torn from their context and grossly abused and misinterpreted, but few more so than this. It is the text usually chosen by those who wish to excuse a setting forth of God under the attributes of Moloch. With any such views it has not the remotest connection. It simply means, "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men," either "to keep in view the same fear of the Lord as ourselves," or (reverting to his last assertion of his own sincerity and integrity in ver. 9), "that our sole ambition is to please God." The rendering, "the terror of the Lord," for the every day expression, "the fear of the Lord," was wantonly intruded into modern versions by Beza, and has not a single word to be said in its favour. The phrase means (as always) not the dread which God inspires, but the holy fear which mingles with our love of him. To teach men to regard God with terror is to undo the best teaching of all Scripture, which indeed has too often been the main end of human systems of theology. <span class="accented">We persuade men</span>. Not in a bad sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). The attacks and calumnies of enemies make it necessary to vindicate our integrity is men; but we have no need to do so to God, because he already knows us (comp. "<span class="accented">persuading</span> Blastus," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We are made manifest unto God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but to</span> <span class="accented">God we have been</span> (<span class="accented">and are</span>) <span class="accented">manifested</span>. He needs no self defence from us. <span class="cmt_word">Are made manifest in your consciences;</span> <span class="accented">but I hope that I have been, and am now, made manifest in your consciences</span>. In other words, I trust that this apology into which you have driven me has achieved its ends; and that, whatever may be your prejudices and innuendoes, before the bar of the individual <span class="accented">conscience</span> of each of you we now stand clear (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-15 The apostle quickens himself and others to acts of duty. Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!</body></html>
