He desired to guard against the suspicion of those who were too ready to suspect. His companions were to bear witness that the sums which he took up with him from the several churches were what had actually been collected. They were to be, practically, auditors of his accounts. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>.) He dwells again, later on in the Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-18.htm" title="I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?">2Corinthians 12:18-19</a>), on the same measure of precaution.<p><span class= "bld">This abundance.</span>--The word, which primarily signifies "succulence," or juiciness, as used of plants and fruits, does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It has rather the look of belonging to St. Luke's medical vocabulary, and is, indeed, used by Hippocrates (<span class= "ital">De Gen,</span> p. 28) of the full habit of body of a youth attaining puberty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Avoiding this.</span> The object in sending Titus and the brother was to cut away the possibility of blame and suspicion. The word "avoiding" (<span class="accented">stellomenoi</span>) literally means "furling sail," and then "taking precautions." It may, however, mean "making this arrangement" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>). Too much stress has been laid on St. Paul's "use of nautical terms" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>, etc.). They belong, in fact, to the very phraseology of the Greek language. <span class="cmt_word">That no man should blame us</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>). St. Paul here sets a valuable and necessary example to all Christians who are entrusted with the management of charitable funds. It is their duty to take every step which may place them above the possibility of of suspicion. Their management of the sums entrusted to them should be obviously and transparently business-like and honourable. St. Paul taught this behaviour both by example and by precept (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>). There is such a thing as a foolish and reprehensible indifference to public opinion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>). Yet with all his noble carefulness, St. Paul did not escape this very slander (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In this abundance.</span> The word, which occurs here only, means literally "succulence," but in the LXX. the adjective means "rich" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-9.htm">1 Kings 1:9</a>). It here implies that the sum which had been collected by St. Paul's exertion was a large one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, that it might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted. It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful, and employed in his service. The good opinion others have of us, should be an argument with us to do well.</body></html>
