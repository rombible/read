The rule of life is repeated, a few months afterwards, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm" title="Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.">Romans 12:17</a>. The English reader does not recognise the fact, which the Greek reader would see at once, that the words are a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm" title="So shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.">Proverbs 3:4</a>. where the Greek version has: "Write them upon the table of thine heart, and thou shalt find favour. <span class= "ital">Provide things honest in the sight of God and man.</span> The citation is interesting, as showing that even one who was taught by the Spirit, as St. Paul was, could yet find guidance for his daily conduct in a book which seems to many almost to be below the level of the spiritual life. In this case, had the Apostle had only the judgment of God to consider, he could with a pure conscience have taken up the money to Jerusalem by himself. But he had to consider that men were judging him, and might suspect him, and therefore he insisted, as has been said above, on having his accounts audited.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Honest things.</span> The word "honest" means "honourable" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>, LXX.). Not only in the sight of the Lord. Such precautions would be unnecessary if others were not concerned, for God knows our honesty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But also before men.</span> Although the text "avoid all <span class="accented">appearance</span> of evil" should be rendered "avoid every species of evil," the mistranslation conveys a wise lesson. "In a field of melons," says the Chinese proverb. "do not stoop to tie your shoe;" for that will <span class="accented">look</span> as if you wanted to steal one of the melons. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, that it might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted. It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful, and employed in his service. The good opinion others have of us, should be an argument with us to do well.</body></html>
