He had been, to a certain extent, successful. Encouraged by the report of that success, St. Paul had now entreated Titus to return to Corinth, and to bring the good work to its completion. "This grace <span class= "ital">also</span>" practically means--this work of liberality, as well as that of repentance and loyal obedience already spoken of in 2 Corinthians 7.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Insomuch that.</span> Their liberality encouraged me so greatly that I exhorted Titus to return to Corinth once more, and see whether he could not receive some proof that you were equally liberal. The remarks that follow are full of delicate reserve, but under their exquisite tact and urbanity we can perceive that the Corinthians had <span class="accented">talked</span> very loudly about their contributions, and had promised with great zeal, but had shown themselves somewhat slack in redeeming their promises. <span class="cmt_word">We exhorted Titus.</span> It is curious that this word is constantly used of the missions of Titus (ver. 17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As he had began.</span> "That as no inaugurated (this collection), so he would also complete towards you this gracious work also." Among other works of grace which Titus might complete by returning to them from Macedonia was the kindly collection which he had begun to set on foot in his previous visit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The grace of God must be owned as the root and fountain of all the good in us, or done by us, at any time. It is great grace and favour from God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love. How different this from the conduct of those who will not join in any good work, unless urged into it!</body></html>
