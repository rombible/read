The topic on which the Epistle now touches, and which is carried on through this and the following chapter, was one very dear to the Apostle's heart. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>.) When he wrote before he had simply given directions as to what the Corinthians were to do. Now he has something to tell them. The churches of Macedonia--Philippi, we must believe, prominent among them--had been true to their old generosity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-8.htm" title="I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.">2Corinthians 11:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15</a>), and were now showing it, not, as before, in personal kindness to their teacher, but in the truer way of acting as he wished them to act; and he sees in this a means of stirring up his friends at Corinth to an honourable emulation. There is something intensely characteristic in the way in which he opens his statement. He traces the generosity of the Macedonians to its true source. He is going to tell the Corinthians of the "grace of God" that has enabled them to do so much.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We do you to wit;</span> rather, <span class="accented">we make known to you</span>. The phrase is like the modern "I wish to inform you." In this and the next chapter St. Paul, having fully spoken of the joy which had been caused to him by their reception of his first letter, and having said as much as he then intended to say in answer to the charges insinuated against him, proceeds to give directions about the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem. He had already spoken of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a>), but feared that they were behindhand, and now sends Titus to stimulate their zeal. The style throughout is brief and allusive, because he had already, in various ways, brought this matter fully before them. Throughout this section he shows in a remarkable degree the tact, courtesy, high sense of honour, and practical wisdom which were among his many gifts. The "but" with which the chapter begins in the original is St. Paul's ordinary formula of transition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>, etc. (For the phrase, "we inform you," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1</a>.) It is one of numberless incidental proofs of the genuineness of this group of Epistles - the Epistles of the second great missionary journey - that the same words, phrases, and thoughts constantly recur in them. <span class="cmt_word">The grace of God</span> (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">Bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia;</span> rather, <span class="accented">which is being bestowed in the Churches</span>. St. Paul wants to tell the Corinthians how extremely liberal the Macedonians have been, since it was his custom to stir up one Church by the example of another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>); but he begins by speaking of their generosity as a proof of the grace which they are receiving from the Holy Spirit. <span class="accented">The Churches of Macedonia</span>. The only Macedonian Churches of which we have any details in the New Testament are those of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea. They seem to have been peculiarly dear to St. Paul, who was attracted by their cheerfulness in affliction and their generosity in the midst of want. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The grace of God must be owned as the root and fountain of all the good in us, or done by us, at any time. It is great grace and favour from God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love. How different this from the conduct of those who will not join in any good work, unless urged into it!</body></html>
