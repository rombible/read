The general current of patristic interpretation (represented, we may add, in the Collect for St. Luke's Day in the Prayer Book of the Church of England, though not in that of the Breviary of the Church of Rome) ran in favour of St. Luke; but this rested on the assumption, for which there is no evidence, and against which there is a strong balance of probabilities, that he was already well known as the writer of a Gospel. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke, </span>Vol. I., p. 239.) Apart from this, however, it may be urged that there is more evidence in favour of this hypothesis than of any other. If the words be interpreted, as they must, as pointing to a preacher of the gospel, we have indications of St. Luke having done this at Antioch, at Troas, and at Philippi. None of the other companions of St. Paul who have been suggested, such as Tychicus or Trophimus, was likely to have so wide-spread a reputation. None was so likely to be with him at the time at Philippi. And it may be noted further--and this, so far as I know, is a point which has not hitherto been dwelt on--that there was no man so fitted to stir up the Corinthians, by his personal character, to a worthy completion of the good work they had begun. We have seen that in his Gospel he dwells emphatically on all parts of our Lord's teaching that point out the danger of riches and the blessedness of a generous almsgiving (see <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke,</span> Vol. I., p. 242); how at Philippi his influence was traceable in the liberal supplies sent to St. Paul at Thessalonica (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-40.htm" title="And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.">Acts 16:40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15</a>) and at Corinth (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>). Was not such a man, we may ask, eminently adapted for the mission on which the "brother, whose praise is in the gospel," was now sent? and was not the Apostle likely to choose him above all others for it? For Mark and Gaius, who have also been suggested, there is not a shadow of evidence; and as the latter was of Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>), he was not likely to have been sent thither from Philippi. The tense, "we have sent," is, as before, the epistolary aorist, used of the time at which the letter was being written.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The brother, whose praise is in the gospel.</span> The phrase means, "whose worth is praised wherever the glad tidings are preached." There can be no reference to any of the four written Gospels, for they were not in the hands of Christians till a later date; nor did the word "gospel" acquire this significance till afterwards. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5</a>, it is somewhat precariously inferred that St. Luke is meant. Others have conjectured Barnabas, Silas (who are out of the question), Erastus, Mark, a brother of Titus, etc. St. Luke is not unlikely to have been selected as a delegate by the Church of Philippi; but further than this we can say nothing. St. Luke was not a Macedonian by birth, and any Macedonian (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Aristarchus, Sopater, Secundus, Epaphroditus) seems to be excluded by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>. Palsy notes it as curious that the <span class="accented">object</span> of St. Paul's journey to Jerusalem, Which is so prominent in this group of Epistles, is only mentioned indirectly and incidentally by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>) in the Acts of the Apostles. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, that it might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted. It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful, and employed in his service. The good opinion others have of us, should be an argument with us to do well.</body></html>
