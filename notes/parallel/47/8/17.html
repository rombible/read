It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions.

A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful, and employed in his service. The good opinion others have of us, should be an argument with us to do well.</body></html>
