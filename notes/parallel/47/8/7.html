He opens, as was his manner, with words of praise, and dexterously combines the gifts of "utterance and knowledge," which he had acknowledged before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1Corinthians 1:5</a>), with the "earnestness and love" of which he had spoken in this very Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2Corinthians 7:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And in your love to us.</span>--Some MSS. give the reading "our love for you," but that in the text has abundant authority, and gives a far better meaning. The English expresses the general meaning, but there is a subtle delicacy in the Greek: "the love which, flowing from you, rests in us as its object." The other reading would convey the sense of "the love which, flowing from us--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from our teaching and influence--now dwells in you, and shows itself in act." In any case, he is praising them for a quality which is actually theirs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span>. In the following verses to ver. 15 he tells them his wishes about this collection. He desires them to show generosity among their other graces (ver. 7), not by way of command, but that they may emulate others and show their love (ver. 8) by following the example of Christ (ver. 9). And by acting thus they would prove the sincerity of their former promises (vers. 10, 11), especially as he did not wish them to give more than they could justly spare by way of reciprocity (vers. 12-15). <span class="cmt_word">As ye abound in every thing, in faith,</span> etc. Perhaps "by faith," etc., "St. Paul," says Grotius, "knew the art of the orators to move by praising." This method of conciliating attention is technically called <span class="accented">proparaitesis</span>. The praise was, of course, sincere, though, no doubt, it was expressed with the generosity of love (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And in your love to us.</span> The Greek is more emphatic," and by the love from you in us;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the love which streams from you, and which I feel in myself. <span class="cmt_word">In this grace also;</span> namely, the grace of Christian liberality. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-9 Faith is the root; and as without faith it is not possible to please God, Heb 11:6, so those who abound in faith, will abound in other graces and good works also; and this will work and show itself by love. Great talkers are not always the best doers; but these Corinthians were diligent to do, as well as to know and talk well. To all these good things the apostle desires them to add this grace also, to abound in charity to the poor. The best arguments for Christian duties, are drawn from the grace and love of Christ. Though he was rich, as being God, equal in power and glory with the Father, yet he not only became man for us, but became poor also. At length he emptied himself, as it were, to ransom their souls by his sacrifice on the cross. From what riches, blessed Lord, to what poverty didst thou descend for our sakes! and to what riches hast thou advanced us through thy poverty! It is our happiness to be wholly at thy disposal.</body></html>
