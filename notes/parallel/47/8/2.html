The "poverty" at Philippi may possibly be connected with the preponderance of women in the Church there, as indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.">Acts 16:13</a>. In the absence of the bread-winners of a household, Christian women in a Graeco-Roman city would find but scanty means of subsistence. In part, however, the churches were but sharers in a widely-spread distress. Macedonia and Achaia never recovered from the three wars between Caesar and Pompeius, between the Triumvirs and Brutus and Cassius, and between Augustus and Antonius. Under Tiberius, they petitioned for a diminution of their burdens, and were accordingly transferred for a time from the jurisdiction of the senate to that of the emperor, as involving a less heavy taxation.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the riches of their liberality.</span>--The primary meaning of the word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2Corinthians 1:12</a> (where see Note), is simplicity, or singleness of purpose. That singleness, when shown in gifts, leads to "liberality," and so the word had acquired the secondary sense in which it seems here to be used. Tyndale, and Cranmer, however, give "singleness," and the Rhemish version "simplicity." "Liberality" first appears in that of Geneva.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a great trial of affliction;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in much testing of affliction</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in an affliction which put to the proof their Christian character. "They were not simply afflicted," says St. Chrysostom, "but in such a way as also to become approved by their endurance." (For the word rendered "trial," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-4.htm">Romans 5:4</a>, and in this Epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>.) "Affliction" seems to have befallen the Churches of Macedonia very heavily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>), chiefly through the jealousy of the Jews, who excited the hatred of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The abundance of their joy.</span> Another reference to joy in sadness (see on 2 Corinthians 7:4). There is not the least necessity to understand the verb "is" or "was" after this clause. "The abundance... abounded" is indeed a pleonasm, but is not at all unlike the style of St. Paul. He means to say that their joy overflowed their affliction, and their liberality overflowed their poverty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-44.htm">Mark 12:44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their deep poverty;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their pauperism to the depth</span>; their abysmal penury. Though they were <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, they showed themselves in generosity to be <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. Stanley refers to Arnold's 'Roman Commonwealth,' where he mentions that the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia, which had suffered greatly in the three civil wars, appealed successfully to Tiberius for a diminution of their burdens. The gift of the Macedonians was like the widow's mite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-3.htm">Luke 21:3, 4</a>, where similar words occur <span class="accented">- perisseuo, husterema</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Of their liberality;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of their singleness of purpose</span> or <span class="accented">simplicity</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>). The "grace" and single-heartedness to which he alludes <span class="accented">showed</span> themselves in liberality. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The grace of God must be owned as the root and fountain of all the good in us, or done by us, at any time. It is great grace and favour from God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love. How different this from the conduct of those who will not join in any good work, unless urged into it!</body></html>
