They were so poor that it was impossible to expect much from them, but they surpassed my expectations in every way. The Church of Philippi, perhaps under the influence of Lydia, was remarkable for generosity, and was the only Church from which St. Paul would accept any personal help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">First</span>. "They gave <span class="accented">themselves</span> to the Lord, which is the best of all, and they gave themselves as helpers to us also - by the will of God." (For a similar use of "and" to imply a matter of less importance, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>.) The phrase, "by the will of God," implies thanksgiving to God for the grace which enabled them to give themselves to him, and their goods to his saints. Being "a peculiar people," they naturally showed themselves "zealous of good works" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>). <span class="accented">First</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9, 10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The grace of God must be owned as the root and fountain of all the good in us, or done by us, at any time. It is great grace and favour from God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love. How different this from the conduct of those who will not join in any good work, unless urged into it!</body></html>
