Our common phrase, <span class= "ital">As to Titus</span> . . . <span class= "ital">as to our brethren,</span> exactly expresses St. Paul's meaning. In the "messengers" of the churches we find in the Greek the word "Apostles" used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25</a>, and possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>, in a lower sense (the Greek has no article), for "<span class= "ital">delegates</span> of the churches," as the Twelve and Paul and Barnabas were delegates of Christ. The other epithet--"the glory of Christ"--is an unusual one. To say that they were working only to that glory, though true, seems hardly adequate, and we gain a deeper thought by connecting it with the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>. "These messengers," he says, "are like Christ in character: they reflect His glory.
