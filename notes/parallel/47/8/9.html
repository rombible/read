This is doubtless the chief thought expressed, but we can scarcely doubt that the words refer also to the outward aspect of our Lord's life. He chose the lot of the poor, almost of the beggar (the Greek word "poor" is so translated, and rightly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/16-20.htm" title="And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,">Luke 16:20-22</a>), as Francis of Assisi and others have done in seeking to follow in His steps. And this He did that men might by that spectacle of a life of self-surrender be sharers with Him in the eternal wealth of the Spirit, and find their treasure not in earth but heaven. As regards the outward mendicant aspect of our Lord's life, and that of His disciples, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-10.htm" title="Nor money for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.">Matthew 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm" title="This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.">John 12:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The word "grace," as in vers. 4, 6, 7, here means "gracious beneficence." <span class="cmt_word">Though he was rich</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-15.htm">John 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Became poor.</span> The aorist implies the concentration of his self-sacrifice in a single act. <span class="cmt_word">By his poverty.</span> The word "his" in the Greek implies the <span class="accented">greatness</span> of Christ. The word for "poverty" would, in classical Greek, mean "pauperism" or "mendicancy." Dean Stanley (referring to Milman's 'Latin Christianity,' 5. bk. 12. c. 6) points out how large a place this verse occupied in the mediaeval controversies between the moderate and the extreme members of the mendicant orders. William of Ockham and others, taking the word "poverty" in its extremest sense, maintained that the Franciscans ought to possess <span class="accented">nothing</span>; but Pope John XXII., with the Dominicans, took a more rational view of the sense and of the historic facts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-9 Faith is the root; and as without faith it is not possible to please God, Heb 11:6, so those who abound in faith, will abound in other graces and good works also; and this will work and show itself by love. Great talkers are not always the best doers; but these Corinthians were diligent to do, as well as to know and talk well. To all these good things the apostle desires them to add this grace also, to abound in charity to the poor. The best arguments for Christian duties, are drawn from the grace and love of Christ. Though he was rich, as being God, equal in power and glory with the Father, yet he not only became man for us, but became poor also. At length he emptied himself, as it were, to ransom their souls by his sacrifice on the cross. From what riches, blessed Lord, to what poverty didst thou descend for our sakes! and to what riches hast thou advanced us through thy poverty! It is our happiness to be wholly at thy disposal.</body></html>
