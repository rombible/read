Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_7453.htm">Strong's Hebrew 7453: </a> </span><span class="str2">Friend, companion, fellow</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/esther/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">The Jews of the villages . . . the unwalled towns.</span>--Virtually the same Hebrew word is used in both these cases (<span class= "ital">perazim, perazoth</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The meaning is that of country towns, undefended by bulwarks, or, at any rate, not in the sense in which the capital would be. We find the word used in contrast with "fenced cities" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-5.htm" title="All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns</span>. Rather, "the Jews of the <span class="accented">country</span>, who dwelt in the <span class="accented">country</span> towns." There are places where the word translated "<span class="accented">unwalled"</span> connotes that idea - e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>; but the main notion which it expresses is always that of a "country region." Here walls are not at all in the thought of the writer, who intends a contrast between the Jews of the metropolis and those of the provinces. Ecbatana and Babylon are "<span class="accented">country</span> towns" to a Jew of Susa, such as the writer. <span class="cmt_word">A good day</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>, with the comment. <span class="cmt_word">Sending portions one to another</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>; and for the precept on which the practice was founded see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>. In modern times the Jews keep up the practice, and on the 15th of Adar both interchange gifts, chiefly sweetmeats, and make liberal offerings for the poor (comp. ver. 22, <span class="accented">ad fin</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-19 The enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them by the former edict. If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together, strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day after they had finished their work. When we have received great mercies from God, we ought to be speedy in making thankful returns to him.</body></html>
