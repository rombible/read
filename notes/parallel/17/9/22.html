This was the key-note of Purina, the dominant idea, to which all else was secondary and sub-ordinate - sorrow turned into joy, "mourning into dancing," utter destruction into a signal triumph. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30.htm">Psalm 30</a>. might well have been written at this time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:20-32 The observance of the Jewish feasts, is a public declaration of the truth of the Old Testament Scriptures. And as the Old Testament Scriptures are true, the Messiah expected by the Jews is come long ago; and none but Jesus of Nazareth can be that Messiah. The festival was appointed by authority, yet under the direction of the Spirit of God. It was called the feast of Purim, from a Persian word, which signifies a lot. The name of this festival would remind them of the almighty power of the God of Israel, who served his own purposes by the superstitions of the heathen. In reviewing our mercies, we should advert to former fears and distresses. When our mercies are personal, we should not by forgetfulness lose the comfort of them, or withhold from the Lord the glory due to his name. May the Lord teach us to rejoice, with that holy joy which anticipates and prepares for the blessedness of heaven. Every instance of Divine goodness to ourselves, is a new obligation laid on us to do good, to those especially who most need our bounty. Above all, redemption by Christ binds us to be merciful, 2Co 8:9.</body></html>
