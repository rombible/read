Herein Esther at once makes confession of her nationality, and relying on the king's still recent gratitude to one of the race, aided by his present cordiality to herself, she risks, as indeed she can no longer help doing, the fate of herself and her race on the momentary impulse of her fickle lord. Happily for her, God has willed that these, perhaps at any other time untrustworthy grounds of reliance, shall suffice. The "hearts of kings are in His rule and governance," and now the heart of one is "disposed and turned, as it seemeth best to His godly wisdom."<p><span class= "bld">Although the enemy. . . .</span>--The meaning of this clause is not quite clear. The literal translation is, <span class= "ital">although</span> (or <span class= "ital">because</span>)<span class= "ital"> the enemy is not equal to</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> does not make up for) <span class= "ital">the king's hurt.</span> This may mean (<span class= "ital">a</span>) that Haman, <span class= "ital">though</span> willing to pay a large sum into the royal treasury, cannot thereby make up for the loss which the king must incur by wholesale massacre being carried on in his realm; or (b) "were we merely to be sold into slavery, instead of being killed outright, I should have said nothing, because the enemy was not one worth the king's while to trouble himself about." We prefer the former view. The word "enemy" is that translated <span class= "ital">adversary,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-6.htm" title="And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.">Esther 7:6</a>, and properly means one who oppresses, afflicts, distresses. The word which is, literally, <span class= "ital">equal to, comparable with,</span> has already occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-8.htm" title="And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.">Esther 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-13.htm" title="Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.">Esther 5:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we are sold, I and my people</span>. Haman has paid our price, has given ten thousand talents for us, and you, O king, have sold us to him. The reproach is covert, but clearly contained in the words; and so the king must have understood Esther. <span class="cmt_word">To be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish</span>. The use of three synonyms for one and the same thing is not mere verbiage, but very expressive. "We are sold, all of us, to be overwhelmed in one universal, promiscuous, unsparing destruction." <span class="cmt_word">Although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage</span>. "Although, even in that case, the enemy (Haman) could not (by the payment that he has made) compensate the king for the damage that he would suffer by losing so many subjects." So Gesenius, Rambach, Dathe, and others. But it is simpler, and Perhaps better, to understand the passage as Bertheau does: "for the enemy (Haman) is not worthy to vex the king," or "is not worth vexing the king about." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 If the love of life causes earnest pleadings with those that can only kill the body, how fervent should our prayers be to Him, who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell! How should we pray for the salvation of our relatives, friends, and all around us! When we petition great men, we must be cautious not to give them offence; even just complaints must often be kept back. But when we approach the King of kings with reverence, we cannot ask or expect too much. Though nothing but wrath be our due, God is able and willing to do exceeding abundantly, even beyond all we can ask or think.</body></html>
