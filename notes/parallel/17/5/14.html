Doubtless the punishment intended for Mordecai was crucifixion, for hanging, in the common sense of the term, does not seem to have been in use among the Persians. The same Hebrew word occurring above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-23.htm" title="And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.">Esther 2:23</a>) is rendered <span class= "ital">tree.</span> The Greek word employed is the same as that used in the New Testament for our Saviour's cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-30.htm" title="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm" title="And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:">Acts 10:39</a>, &c).

Rather, "a pale" or "cross." The Persians did not hang men, as we do, but ordinarily executed them by impalement (see the comment on Esther 2:23). <span class="cmt_word">Fifty cubits high</span>. This is a very improbable height, and we may suspect a corruption of the number. It occurs, however, again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-9.htm">Esther 7:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Speak thou unto the king</span>. Haman's wife and friends assume that so trifling a matter as the immediate execution of one Jew will be <span class="accented">of course</span> allowed at the request of the chief minister, who has already obtained an edict for the early destruction of the entire people. It certainly would seem to be highly probable that Xerxes would have granted Haman's petition but for the accident of his sleeplessness, as narrated in the next chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-14 This account of Haman is a comment upon Pr 21:24. Self-admirers and self-flatterers are really self-deceivers. Haman, the higher he is lifted up, the more impatient he is of contempt, and the more enraged at it. The affront from Mordecai spoiled all. A slight affront, which a humble man would scarcely notice, will torment a proud man, even to madness, and will mar all his comforts. Those disposed to be uneasy, will never want something to be uneasy at. Such are proud men; though they have much to their mind, if they have not all to their mind, it is as nothing to them. Many call the proud happy, who display pomp and make a show; but this is a mistaken thought. Many poor cottagers feel far less uneasiness than the rich, with all their fancied advantages around them. The man who knows not Christ, is poor though he be rich, because he is utterly destitute of that which alone is true riches.</body></html>
