[And he besought the Lord, making mention of all the works of the Lord; and he said, Lord God, king ruling over all, for all things are in thy power, and there is no one that shall oppose thee, in thy purpose to save Israel. - For thou hast made the heaven and the earth and every wonderful thing in the <i>world</i> under heaven. And thou art Lord of all, and there is no one who shall resist thee Lord. Thou knowest all things: thou knowest, Lord, that it is not in insolence, nor haughtiness, nor love of glory, that I have done this, to refuse obeisance to the haughty Aman. For I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet for the safety of Israel. But I have done this, that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God: and I will not worship any one except thee, my Lord, and I will not do these things in haughtiness. And now, O Lord God, the King, the God of Abraam, spare thy people, for <i>our enemies</i> are looking upon us to <i>our</i> destruction, and they have desired to destroy thine ancient inheritance. Do not overlook thy peculiar people, whom thou hast redeemed for thyself out of the land of Egypt. Hearken to my prayer, and be propitious to thine inheritance, and turn our mourning into gladness, that we may live and sing praise to thy name, O Lord; and do not utterly destroy the mouth of them that praise thee, O Lord. And all Israel cried with <i>all</i> their might, for death <i>was</i> before their eyes. And queen Esther betook herself for refuge to the Lord, being taken <i>as it were</i> in the agony of death. And having taken off her glorious apparel, she put on garments of distress and mourning; and instead of grand perfumes she filled her head with ashes and dung, and she greatly brought down her body, and she filled every place of her glad adorning with the <i>torn</i> curls of her hair. And she besought the Lord God of Israel, and said, O my Lord, thou alone art our king: help me <i>who am</i> destitute, and have no helper but thee, for my danger <i>is</i> near at hand. I have heard from my birth, in the tribe of my kindred that thou, Lord, tookest Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their kindred for a perpetual inheritance, and hast wrought for them all that thou hast said. And now we have sinned before thee, and thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies, because we honoured their gods: thou art righteous, O Lord. But now they have not been contented with the bitterness of our slavery, but have laid their hands on the hands of their idols, <i>in order</i> to abolish the decree of thy mouth, and utterly to destroy thine inheritances, and to stop the mouth of them that praise thee, and to extinguish the glory of thine house and thine alter, and to open the mouth of the Gentiles to <i>speak</i> the praises of vanities, and <i>in order</i> that a mortal king should be admired for ever. O Lord, do not resign thy scepter to them that are not, and let them not laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel, against themselves, and make an example of him who has begun <i>to injure</i> us. Remember <i>us</i>, O Lord, manifest thyself in the time of our affliction, and encourage me, O King of gods, and ruler of all dominion. Put harmonious speech into my mouth before the lion, and turn his heart to hate him that fights against us, to the utter destruction of him that consent with him. But deliver us by thine hand, and help me <i>who am</i> destitute, and have none but the, O Lord. Thou knowest all things, and knowest that I hate the glory of transgressors, and that I abhor the couch of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger. Thou knowest my necessity, for I abhor the symbol of my proud station, which is upon my head in the days of my splendour: I abhor it as a menstruous cloth, and I wear it not in the days of my tranquility. And thy handmaid has not eaten <i>at</i> the table of Aman, and I have not honoured the banquet of the king, neither have I drunk wine of libations. Neither has thy handmaid rejoiced since the day of my promotion until now, except in thee, O Lord God of Abraam. O god, who has power over all, hearken to the voice of the desperate, and deliver us from the hand of them that devise mischief; and deliver me from my fear.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/drb/esther/4.htm">Douay-Rheims Bible</a></span><br />So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/dbt/esther/4.htm">Darby Bible Translation</a></span><br />And Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/erv/esther/4.htm">English Revised Version</a></span><br />So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/wbt/esther/4.htm">Webster's Bible Translation</a></span><br />So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/web/esther/4.htm">World English Bible</a></span><br />So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ylt/esther/4.htm">Young's Literal Translation</a></span><br /> And Mordecai passeth on, and doth according to all that Esther hath charged upon him.</div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheadingv"><b>Study Bible</b></div><span class="hdg"><a href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/esther/4.htm">Mordecai Appeals to Esther</a></span><br>&#8230;<span class="reftext">16</span>&#8220;Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa, and fast for me.

But when the cause of Christ and his people demand it, we must take up our cross, and follow him. When Christians are disposed to consult their own ease or safety, rather than the public good, they should be blamed. The law was express, all knew it. It is not thus in the court of the King of kings: to the footstool of his throne of grace we may always come boldly, and may be sure of an answer of peace to the prayer of faith. We are welcome, even into the holiest, through the blood of Jesus. Providence so ordered it, that, just then, the king's affections had cooled toward Esther; her faith and courage thereby were the more tried; and God's goodness in the favour she now found with the king, thereby shone the brighter. Haman no doubt did what he could to set the king against her. Mordecai suggests, that it was a cause which, one way or other, would certainly be carried, and which therefore she might safely venture in. This was the language of strong faith, which staggered not at the promise when the danger was most threatening, but against hope believed in hope. He that by sinful devices will save his life, and will not trust God with it in the way of duty, shall lose it in the way of sin. Divine Providence had regard to this matter, in bringing Esther to be queen. Therefore thou art bound in gratitude to do this service for God and his church, else thou dost not answer the end of thy being raised up. There is wise counsel and design in all the providences of God, which will prove that they are all intended for the good of the church. We should, every one, consider for what end God has put us in the place where we are, and study to answer that end: and take care that we do not let it slip. Having solemnly commended our souls and our cause to God, we may venture upon his service. All dangers are trifling compared with the danger of losing our souls. But the trembling sinner is often as much afraid of casting himself, without reserve, upon the Lord's free mercy, as Esther was of coming before the king. Let him venture, as she did, with earnest prayer and supplication, and he shall fare as well and better than she did. The cause of God must prevail: we are safe in being united to it.</body></html>
