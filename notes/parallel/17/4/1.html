It will be noticed that the sorrow both of Mordecai and of the Jews generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-3.htm" title="And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.">Esther 4:3</a>) is described by external manifestations solely. There is rending of garments, putting on of sackcloth and ashes, fasting and weeping and wailing: there is nothing said of prayer and entreaty to the God of Israel, and strong crying to Him who is able to save. Daniel and Ezra and Nehemiah are all Jews, who, like Mordecai and Esther, have to submit to the rule of the alien, though, unlike them, they, when the danger threatened, besought, and not in vain, the help of their God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-23.htm" title="So we fasted and sought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.">Ezra 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,">Nehemiah 1:4</a>, &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mordecai rent his clothes</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3, 5</a> with the comment.

So Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>), and the king of Nineveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>). Either act by itself was a sign of deep grief; both combined betokened the deepest grief possible<span class="cmt_word">. And went out into the midst of the city</span>. The palace was not to be saddened by private griefs (see the next verse). Mordecai, therefore, having assumed the outward signs of extreme sorrow, quitted the palace, and entered the streets of the town. There, overcome by his feelings, he vented them, as Asiatics are wont to do, in loud and piercing cries (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-4 Mordecai avowed his relation to the Jews. Public calamities, that oppress the church of God, should affect our hearts more than any private affliction, and it is peculiarly distressing to occasion sufferings to others. God will keep those that are exposed to evil by the tenderness of their consciences.</body></html>
