And the following is the copy of the letter; The great king Artaxerxes writes thus to the rulers and inferior governors of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia, who hold authority under <i>him</i>. Ruling over many nations and having obtained dominion over the whole world, I was minded (not elated by the confidence of power, but ever conducting <i>myself</i> with great moderation and gentleness) to make the lives of <i>my</i> subjects continually tranquil, desiring both to maintain the kingdom quiet and orderly to <i>its</i> utmost limits, and to restore the peace desired by all men. But when I had enquired of my counsellors how this should be brought to pass. Aman, who excels in soundness of judgment among us, and has been manifestly well inclined without wavering and with unshaken fidelity, and had obtained the second post in the kingdom, informed us that a certain ill-disposed people is mixed up with all the tribes throughout the world, opposed in their law to every <i>other</i> nation, and continually neglecting the commands of the king, so that the united government blamelessly administered by us is not quietly established. Having then conceived that this nation <i>alone of all others</i> is continually set in opposition to every man, introducing as a change a foreign code of laws, and injuriously plotting to accomplish the worst of evils against our interests, and against the happy establishment of the monarchy; we signified to you in the letter written by Aman, who is set over <i>the public</i> affairs and is our second governor, to destroy them all utterly with their wives and children by the swords of the enemies, without pitying or sparing any, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, of the present year; that the people aforetime and now ill-disposed <i>to us</i> having been violently consigned to death in one day, may hereafter secure to us continually a well constituted and quiet <i>state of affairs.</i><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/drb/esther/3.htm">Douay-Rheims Bible</a></span><br />Were sent by the king's messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/dbt/esther/3.htm">Darby Bible Translation</a></span><br />And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, upon the thirteenth of the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/erv/esther/3.htm">English Revised Version</a></span><br />And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/wbt/esther/3.htm">Webster's Bible Translation</a></span><br />And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/web/esther/3.htm">World English Bible</a></span><br />Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ylt/esther/3.htm">Young's Literal Translation</a></span><br /> and letters to be sent by the hand of the runners unto all provinces of the king, to cut off, to slay, and to destroy all the Jews, from young even unto old, infant and women, on one day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month -- it is the month of Adar -- and their spoil to seize,</div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheadingv"><b>Study Bible</b></div><span class="hdg"><a href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/esther/3.htm">Haman Plots Against the Jews</a></span><br>&#8230;<span class="reftext">12</span>On the thirteenth day of the first month, the royal scribes were summoned and the order was written exactly as Haman commanded the royal satraps, the governors of each province, and the officials of each people, in the script of each province and the language of every people.

The Persian system of posts is thus described by Xenophon, who attributes its introduction to Cyrus: - "Stables for horses are erected along the various lines of route, at such a distance one from another as a horse can accomplish in a day. All the stables are provided with a number of horses and grooms. There is a post-master to preside over each, who receives the despatches along with the tired men and horses, and sends them on by fresh horses and fresh riders. Sometimes there is no stoppage in the conveyance even at night; since a night courier takes up the work of the day courier, and continues it. It has been said that these posts outstrip the flight of birds, which is not altogether true; but beyond a doubt it is the most rapid of all methods of conveyance by land" ('Cyrop.,' 8:6, &sect; 17). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish</span>. The writer quotes from the edict, which appears to have had as many surplus words as a modern English law paper. <span class="cmt_word">Young and old, little children and women</span>. "To take the father's life and spare the child's" was thought to be an act of folly in ancient times. Wives and children of criminals were, as a matter of course, put to death with them. This was anciently even the Jewish practice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>), and was quite an established usage in Persia (Herod., 3:119). <span class="cmt_word">The thirteenth day</span>. The Septuagint has "the fourteenth day" in its professed copy of the decree, but confirms the Hebrew text here by making the thirteenth the actual day of the struggle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-1.htm">Esther 9:1</a>). The fourteenth and fifteenth are the days now kept by the Jews; but it is suspected that an alteration has been made in order to assimilate the Purim to the passover feast, which began on the 14th of Nisan. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-15 Without some acquaintance with the human heart, and the history of mankind, we should not think that any prince could consent to a dreadful proposal, so hurtful to himself. Let us be thankful for mild and just government. Haman inquires, according to his own superstitions, how to find a lucky day for the designed massacre! God's wisdom serves its own purposes by men's folly. Haman has appealed to the lot, and the lot, by delaying the execution, gives judgment against him. The event explains the doctrine of a particular providence over all the affairs of men, and the care of God over his church. Haman was afraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he had done; to prevent which, he kept him drinking. This cursed method many often take to drown convictions, and to harden their own hearts, and the hearts of others, in sin. All appeared in a favourable train to accomplish the project. But though sinners are permitted to proceed to the point they aim at, an unseen but almighty Power turns them back. How vain and contemptible are the strongest assaults against Jehovah! Had Haman obtained his wish, and the Jewish nation perished, what must have become of all the promises? How could the prophecies concerning the great Redeemer of the world have been fulfilled? Thus the everlasting covenant itself must have failed, before this diabolical project could take place.</body></html>
