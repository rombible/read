His name, as well as that of his father and his sons, is Persian; and it is thus difficult to see the meaning of the name <span class= "ital">Agagite.</span> which has generally been assumed to imply descent from Agag, king of the Amalekites, with whom the name Agag <span class= "ital">may</span> have been dynastic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-7.htm" title="He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.">Numbers 24:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-8.htm" title="And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.">1Samuel 15:8</a>). Thus Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xi.</span> 6. 5) and the Chaldee Targum call him an Amalekite. But apart from the difficulty of the name being Persian, it is hard to see how, after the wholesale destruction of Amalek recorded in 1 Samuel 15, any members should have been left of the kingly family, maintaining a distinct tribal name for so many centuries. In one of the Greek Apocryphal additions to Esther (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-24.htm" title="Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;">Esther 9:24</a>) Haman is called a Macedonian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span>.

"Haman" is perhaps <span class="accented">Umanish</span>, the Persian equivalent of the Greek Eumenes. "Hammedatha" has been explained as "<span class="accented">given</span> by the moon" (<span class="accented">Mahadata</span>), the initial <span class="accented">h</span> being regarded as the Hebrew article.

The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Bugaean." Both terms are equally inexplicable, with our present knowledge; but most probably the term used was a local one, marking the place of Haman's birth or bringing up. A reference to descent from the Amalekite king Agag (Joseph., 'Ant. Jud.,' 11:6, &sect; 5) is scarcely possible. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Mordecai refused to reverence Haman. The religion of a Jew forbade him to give honours to any mortal man which savoured of idolatry, especially to so wicked a man as Haman. By nature all are idolaters; self is our favourite idol, we are pleased to be treated as if every thing were at our disposal. Though religion by no means destroys good manners, but teaches us to render honour to whom honour is due, yet by a citizen of Zion, not only in his heart, but in his eyes, such a vile person as Haman was, is contemned, Ps 15:4. The true believer cannot obey edicts, or conform to fashions, which break the law of God. He must obey God rather than man, and leave the consequences to him. Haman was full of wrath. His device was inspired by that wicked spirit, who has been a murderer from the beginning; whose enmity to Christ and his church, governs all his children.</body></html>
