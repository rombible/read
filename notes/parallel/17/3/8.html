Haman was not the first who had brought this charge against the Jews (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-13.htm" title="Be it known now to the king, that, if this city be built, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so you shall damage the revenue of the kings.">Ezra 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-16.htm" title="We certify the king that, if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means you shall have no portion on this side the river.">Ezra 4:16</a>). Our Lord's accusers were those who knew no king but Caesar. The early Christians found to their cost how deadly was the accusation of disloyalty to the Empire.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed</span>. It is not always borne in mind how large a part of the Jewish nation remained in the lands to which they had been carried away captive, after the permission had been given to return. Josephus notes that the richer and more influential of the Babylonian Jews were very little inclined to quit Babylon ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1). There was evidently a large Jewish colony at Susa (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-12.htm">Esther 9:12-15</a>). The Book of Tobit shows that Israelites, scarcely to be distinguished from Jews, were settled in Rhages and Ecbatana. The present passage is important as showing the early <span class="accented">wide</span> dispersion of the Jewish people. <span class="cmt_word">Their laws are diverse</span>. A true charge, but a weak argument for their destruction, more especially as the Persians allowed all the conquered nations to retain their own laws and usages. <span class="cmt_word">Neither keep they the king's laws</span>. Important, if true. But it was not true in any broad and general sense. There might be an occasional royal edict which a Jew could not obey; but the laws of the Medes and Persians were in the main righteous laws, and the Jews readily observed them. They were faithful and loyal subjects of the Achaemenian monarchs from first to last from Cyrus to Darius Codomannus. <span class="cmt_word">For the king's profit</span>. Rather, as in the margin, "meet" or "fitting for the king." <span class="cmt_word">To suffer them</span>. Or, "to let them alone." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-15 Without some acquaintance with the human heart, and the history of mankind, we should not think that any prince could consent to a dreadful proposal, so hurtful to himself. Let us be thankful for mild and just government. Haman inquires, according to his own superstitions, how to find a lucky day for the designed massacre! God's wisdom serves its own purposes by men's folly. Haman has appealed to the lot, and the lot, by delaying the execution, gives judgment against him. The event explains the doctrine of a particular providence over all the affairs of men, and the care of God over his church. Haman was afraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he had done; to prevent which, he kept him drinking. This cursed method many often take to drown convictions, and to harden their own hearts, and the hearts of others, in sin. All appeared in a favourable train to accomplish the project. But though sinners are permitted to proceed to the point they aim at, an unseen but almighty Power turns them back. How vain and contemptible are the strongest assaults against Jehovah! Had Haman obtained his wish, and the Jewish nation perished, what must have become of all the promises? How could the prophecies concerning the great Redeemer of the world have been fulfilled? Thus the everlasting covenant itself must have failed, before this diabolical project could take place.</body></html>
