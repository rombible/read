Bishop Wordsworth reminds us that this day was the eve of the Passover, so that Haman's plot against the Jews strangely coincides in time with one five hundred years later, when the Jews themselves, aided by heathen hands and the powers of darkness, sought to vanquish the Saviour; and as the trembling Jews of Persia were delivered by God's goodness, so too by His goodness Satan himself was overthrown and the Lamb that was slain did triumph.<p><span class= "bld">Lieutenants.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">satraps.</span> The Hebrew word here (<span class= "ital">akhashdarpan</span>) is simply an attempt to transliterate the Persian <span class= "ital">khahatrapa,</span> Whence the Greek <span class= "ital">satrapes,</span> and so the English word. The word occurs several times in this book and in Ezra and Daniel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then were the king's scribes called. "Scribes"</span> (in the plural) are spoken of as attending on Xerxes throughout the Grecian expedition (Herod., 7:100; 8:90). Such persons were always near at hand in the palace, ready to draw up edicts. <span class="cmt_word">On the thirteenth day of the first month</span>. It is conjectured that Haman cast his lots on the first day of the year (Berthcau), as an auspicious time for taking anything in hand, and having obtained a <span class="accented">thirteenth</span> day for the massacre, adopted the same number as probably auspicious for the necessary appeal to the king. Having gained the king s consent, he sent at once for the scribes. <span class="cmt_word">The king's lieutenants</span>. Literally, "the king's <span class="accented">satraps."</span> The actual Persian word is used, slightly Hebraised. <span class="cmt_word">And to the governors</span>. The word used has been compared with <span class="accented">pasha</span> (Stanley), and again with beg or bey, but is probably distinct from either. It designates a provincial governor of the second rank-one who would have been called by the Greeks <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The number of these subordinate officials was probably much greater than that of the satraps. <span class="cmt_word">And to the rulers of every people</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the native authorities - the head men of the conquered peoples, to whom the Persian system allowed a considerable share of power. <span class="cmt_word">In the name of king Ahasuerus was it written</span>. All edicts were in the king's name, even when a subject had been allowed to issue them. See the story of Bagseus in Herodotus (3:128), where the edicts, of which he alone was the author, have the form of orders from the king. <span class="cmt_word">And sealed with the king's ring</span>. Or "signet" (see note on ver. 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-15 Without some acquaintance with the human heart, and the history of mankind, we should not think that any prince could consent to a dreadful proposal, so hurtful to himself. Let us be thankful for mild and just government. Haman inquires, according to his own superstitions, how to find a lucky day for the designed massacre! God's wisdom serves its own purposes by men's folly. Haman has appealed to the lot, and the lot, by delaying the execution, gives judgment against him. The event explains the doctrine of a particular providence over all the affairs of men, and the care of God over his church. Haman was afraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he had done; to prevent which, he kept him drinking. This cursed method many often take to drown convictions, and to harden their own hearts, and the hearts of others, in sin. All appeared in a favourable train to accomplish the project. But though sinners are permitted to proceed to the point they aim at, an unseen but almighty Power turns them back. How vain and contemptible are the strongest assaults against Jehovah! Had Haman obtained his wish, and the Jewish nation perished, what must have become of all the promises? How could the prophecies concerning the great Redeemer of the world have been fulfilled? Thus the everlasting covenant itself must have failed, before this diabolical project could take place.</body></html>
