The objection on Mordecai's part was evidently mainly on religious grounds, as giving to a man Divine honours (Josephus <span class= "ital">l.c.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> for it elicits from him the fact that he was a Jew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-4.htm" title="Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he listened not to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.">Esther 3:4</a>), to whom such an act of obeisance would be abhorrent. Whether Mordecai also rebelled against the ignominious character of the obeisance, we cannot say.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the king's servants</span>.

No reason is assigned for this order, which was certainly unusual, since the prostration of an inferior before a superior was a general rule (Herod., 1:134). Perhaps Haman had been elevated from a very low position, and the king therefore thought a special order requisite. <span class="cmt_word">Mordecai bowed not</span>. Greeks occasionally refused to prostrate themselves before the Great King himself, saying that it was not their custom to worship men (Herod., 7:136; Plut., 'Vit. Artax.,' &sect; 22; Arrian., 'Exp. Alex.,' 4:10-12, etc.). Mordecai seems to have had the same feeling. Prostration was, he thought, an act of worship, and it was not proper to worship any one excepting God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Mordecai refused to reverence Haman. The religion of a Jew forbade him to give honours to any mortal man which savoured of idolatry, especially to so wicked a man as Haman. By nature all are idolaters; self is our favourite idol, we are pleased to be treated as if every thing were at our disposal. Though religion by no means destroys good manners, but teaches us to render honour to whom honour is due, yet by a citizen of Zion, not only in his heart, but in his eyes, such a vile person as Haman was, is contemned, Ps 15:4. The true believer cannot obey edicts, or conform to fashions, which break the law of God. He must obey God rather than man, and leave the consequences to him. Haman was full of wrath. His device was inspired by that wicked spirit, who has been a murderer from the beginning; whose enmity to Christ and his church, governs all his children.</body></html>
