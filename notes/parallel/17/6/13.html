Then the tale was one of boastful pride in what he had, and no less boastful pride in what he hoped to be; now it is of bitter disappointment and bitter anticipation, not brightened by any of the thoughts which blunt the keenness of many a sorrow, as when men have nobly done their duty, though it is not God's will that their efforts should succeed for the time, and when the hope could be cherished that a brighter time must dawn before long. Nothing of this comfort could be Hainan's. He had' not failed in an honest discharge of his duty, but in a cruel and unjust scheme (not that the king can be called a whit better in this matter); he knew the usages of his country far too well to suppose for a moment that, after having made such an attempt, and having failed, he would be allowed to try a second time.<p><span class= "bld">If Mordecai . . . before whom thou hast begun</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Poor comfort does the unfortunate schemer get from his household; he knew too well already that he had <span class= "ital">begun</span> to fall, his heart must have told him all too truly that it was but the beginning: what then could he expect from this communication to his family? Had he been the representative of a fallen cause, fallen but not discredited, despairing even of his cause, yet not ashamed of the course that had resulted thus, he might have been helped with counsel and cheering and sympathy. Contrast Zeresh's perhaps last words to her husband with those, for example, of the wife of good John Rogers, or of Rowland Taylor, on their way. to the stake, in the days of the Marian persecution.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His wise men</span>.

It is difficult to understand how this could any longer be regarded as doubtful.

The "wise men" profess to regard it as uncertain, perhaps to give their words a more oracular character. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely fall</span>.

Honour is well bestowed on those that do not think themselves above their business. But Haman could not bear it. What harm had it done him? But that will break a proud man's heart, which will not break a humble man's sleep. His doom was, out of this event, read to him by his wife and his friends. They plainly confessed that the Jews, though scattered through the nations, were special objects of Divine care. Miserable comforters are they all; they did not advise Haman to repent, but foretold his fate as unavoidable. The wisdom of God is seen, in timing the means of his church's deliverance, so as to manifest his own glory.</body></html>
