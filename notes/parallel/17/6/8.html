Whether Hainan's character had at its best estate much discretion, or whether he rose to his high position, not by the qualities that should commend a statesman to a king, but, like many another Eastern Vizier, had by flattery and base arts gained the royal favour, we cannot say; here he shows the lack of the most ordinary discretion, his vanity is so inordinate that he cannot see the possibility of any one's merits save his own. The request which Haman made may be illustrated by the permission granted by Xerxes to his uncle Artabanus to put on the royal robes and sleep in the royal bed at Susa (Herod, vii. 15-17).<p><span class= "bld">The horse that the king rideth upon.</span>--Thus Pharaoh, desiring-to honour Joseph, made him ride in his own chariot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm" title="And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.">Genesis 41:43</a>): David, wishing to show that Solomon had really become king in his father's lifetime, commands that he should ride on the king's mule (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-33.htm" title="The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:">1Kings 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-44.htm" title="And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule:">1Kings 1:44</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the crown royal which is set upon his head.</span>--If we take the Hebrew here quite literally, the meaning must be <span class= "ital">and on whose</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the horse's) <span class= "ital">head a royal crown is set.</span> The only objection to this view is, that there appears to be no evidence of such a custom among the Persians. Some render, <span class= "ital">and that a</span> (or <span class= "ital">the:</span> the Hebrew is necessarily ambiguous in such a case) <span class= "ital">royal crown be set,</span> but this we consider does violence to the Hebrew. It must be noted that both the king in his reply, and the writer in describing what actually took place, make no mention of a crown as worn by Mordecai, nor does Haman in the following verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the royal apparel be brought</span>. To wear a dress previously worn by the king was, under ordinary circumstances, a breach of Persian law (Plut., 'Vit. Artax.,' 5); but the king might allow it (Herod., 7:17) or condone it (Plut., 1. s.c.). <span class="cmt_word">The horse that the king rideth upon</span>. Rather, "a horse that the king hath ridden." <span class="cmt_word">And the crown royal which is set upon his head</span>. Rather, "and that hath a crown royal set on his head." Some peculiar ornament by which the royal steed was made conspicuous is intended, not his own crown, which even Xerxes would scarcely have allowed another to wear. See vers. 9 and 11, where the dress and the horse are referred to, but the crown, as an adjunct of the horse, not particularised. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:4-11 See how men's pride deceives them. The deceitfulness of our own hearts appears in nothing more than in the conceit we have of ourselves and our own performances: against which we should constantly watch and pray. Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others profess for us, is not so great as it seems to be, that we may not think too well of ourselves, nor trust too much in others. How Haman is struck, when the king bids him do honour to Mordecai the Jew, the very man whom he hated above all men, whose ruin he was now designing!</body></html>
