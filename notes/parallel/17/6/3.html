In Persia, where "royal benefactors" formed a distinct class, and had their names inscribed on a special list (Herod., 8:85), it was especially incumbent on the monarch to see that every such person received a return proportioned to the value of his service. Ahasuerus seems to have supposed that some honour or dignity must have been conferred upon Mordecai, though he could not recollect what it was; and it is difficult to understand how the omission to reward him had occurred, unless there was a prejudice against him among the high court officials, who may have known that he was a Jew, though his fellow-servants did not (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-4.htm">Esther 3:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-3 The providence of God rules over the smallest concerns of men.
