The first (<span class= "ital">bahat</span>) is rendered by the LXX. as a stone of emerald colour, and may perhaps be malachite. The second (<span class= "ital">shesh</span>) is white marble, the third (<span class= "ital">dar</span>) is pearly, and the last (<span class= "ital">sokhereth</span>) black.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where were white, green, and blue hangings</span>. There is nothing in the original corresponding to "green." The "hangings," or rather awning, was of white cotton (<span class="accented">karphas</span>) and violet. Mr. Loftus supposes that it was carried across from the central pillared hall to the detached porticoes, thus shading the guests from the intense heat of the sun ('Chaldaea and Susiana,' p. 375). <span class="cmt_word">Fastened with cords of fine linen and purple</span>. Very strong cords would be needed to support the awning if it was carried across as above suggested, over a space of nearly sixty feet. <span class="cmt_word">To rings of silver</span>. The exact use of the rings is doubtful. Perhaps they were inserted into the stone work in order that the cords might be made fast to them. <span class="cmt_word">Pillars of marble</span>. The pillars at Susa are not of marble, but of a dark-blue limestone. Perhaps the Hebrew <span class="accented">shesh</span> designated this stone rather than marble. <span class="cmt_word">The beds were of gold and silver</span>. The couches on which the guests reclined are intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-8.htm">Esther 7:8</a>). These were either covered with gold and silver cloth, or had their actual framework of the precious metals, like those which Xerxes took with him into Greece (see Herod., 9:82). <span class="cmt_word">Upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black marble.</span> The four words which follow "pavement" are not adjectives denoting colours, but the names of four different materials. One is <span class="accented">shesh</span>, the material of the pillars, which accords with the fact that such pavement slabs as have been found at Susa are, like the columns, of a blue limestone. The other materials are unknown to us, and we cannot say what the exact colours were; but no doubt the general result was a mosaic pavement of four different hues. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 The pride of Ahasuerus's heart rising with the grandeur of his kingdom, he made an extravagant feast. This was vain glory. Better is a dinner of herbs with quietness, than this banquet of wine, with all the noise and tumult that must have attended it. But except grace prevails in the heart, self-exaltation and self-indulgence, in one form or another, will be the ruling principle. Yet none did compel; so that if any drank to excess, it was their own fault. This caution of a heathen prince, even when he would show his generosity, may shame many called Christians, who, under pretence of sending the health round, send sin round, and death with it. There is a woe to them that do so; let them read it, and tremble, Hab 2:15,16.</body></html>
