We are told that once a year, at the feast of Mithra, the king of Persia was bound to intoxicate himself (Duris, Fr. 13). At other times he did as he pleased, but probably generally drank reason was somewhat obscured. <span class="cmt_word">Mehuman</span>, etc. Persian etymologies have been given for most of these names, but they are all more or less uncertain; and as eunuchs were often foreigners, mutilated for the Persian market (Herod., 3:93; 8:105), who bore foreign names, like the Hermotimus of Herodotus (8:104-106), it is quite possible that Persian etymologies may here be out of place. <span class="cmt_word">Bigtha</span>, however, if it be regarded as a shortened form of Bigthan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21</a>) or Bigthana (ch. 6.), would seem to be Persian, being equivalent to <span class="accented">Bagadana</span> ( = Theodorus), "the gift of God." <span class="cmt_word">Chamberlains</span>. Really, as in the margin, "eunuchs." The influence of eunuchs at the Persian court was great from the time of Xerxes. Ctesias makes them of importance even from the time of Cyrus ('Exc. Pera,' &sect; 5, 9). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-22 Ahasuerus's feast ended in heaviness, by his own folly. Seasons of peculiar festivity often end in vexation. Superiors should be careful not to command what may reasonably be disobeyed. But when wine is in, men's reason departs from them. He that had rule over 127 provinces, had no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policy of the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way for Esther to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even before it had entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power. Let us rejoice that the Lord reigns, and will overrule the madness or folly of mankind to promote his own glory, and the safety and happiness of his people.</body></html>
