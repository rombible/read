Now he was of the captivity which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried captive from Jerusalem, with Jachonias the king of Judea. And this was his dream: Behold, voices and a noise, thunders and earthquake, tumult upon the earth. And, behold, two great serpents came forth, both ready for conflict, and there came from them a great voice, and by their voice every nation was prepared for battle, even to fight against the nation of the just. And, behold, a day of darkness and blackness, tribulation and anguish, affection and tumult upon the earth. And all the righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own afflictions; and they prepared to die, and cried to God: and from their cry there came as it were a great river from a little fountain , <i>even</i> much water. And light and the sun arose, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the honorable. And Mardochaeus who had seen this vision and what God desired to do, having awoke, kept it in his heart, and desired by all means to interpret it, even till night. And Mardochaeus rested quiet in the palace with Gabatha and Tharrha the king's two chamberlains, eunuchs who guarded the palace. And he heard their reasoning and searched out their plans, and learnt that they were preparing to lay hands on king Artaxerxes: and he informed the king concerning them. And the king examined the two chamberlains, and they confessed, and were executed. And the king wrote these things for a memorial: also Mardochaeus wrote concerning these matters. And the king commanded Mardochaeus to attend in the palace, and gave gifts for this service. And Aman the son of Amadathes the Bugean was honourable in the sight of the king, and he endeavored to hurt Mardochaeus and his people, because of the two chamberlains of the king. And it came to pass after these things in the days of Artaxerxes, &#8212;(this Artaxerxes ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India)&#8212;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/drb/esther/1.htm">Douay-Rheims Bible</a></span><br />In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/dbt/esther/1.htm">Darby Bible Translation</a></span><br />And it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (that is, the Ahasuerus that reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces),<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/erv/esther/1.htm">English Revised Version</a></span><br />Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/wbt/esther/1.htm">Webster's Bible Translation</a></span><br />Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Cush, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/web/esther/1.htm">World English Bible</a></span><br />Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ylt/esther/1.htm">Young's Literal Translation</a></span><br /> And it cometh to pass, in the days of Ahasuerus -- he is Ahasuerus who is reigning from Hodu even unto Cush, seven and twenty and a hundred provinces -- </div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheadingv"><b>Study Bible</b></div><span class="hdg"><a href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/esther/1.htm">Xerxes' Royal Feast</a></span><br> <span class="reftext">1</span><span class="highl"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1961.htm" title="1961: vayHi (Conj-w :: V-Qal-ConsecImperf-3ms) -- To fall out, come to pass, become, be">This is what happened</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3117.htm" title="3117: biMei (Prep-b :: N-mpc) -- A day">in the days</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/325.htm" title="325: achashveRoosh (N-proper-ms) -- Ahasuerus -- king of Persia">of Xerxes,</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/4427.htm" title="4427: hammoleCh (Art :: V-Qal-Prtcpl-ms) -- To reign, inceptively, to ascend the throne, to induct into royalty, to take counsel">who reigned over</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7651.htm" title="7651: Sheva (Number-fs) -- Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number">127</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/4082.htm" title="4082: mediNah (N-fs) -- A judgeship, jurisdiction, a district, a region">provinces</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1912.htm" title="1912: meHoddu (Prep-m :: N-proper-fs) -- Hodu">from India</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5704.htm" title="5704: vead (Conj-w :: Prep) -- As far as, even to, up to, until, while">to</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3568.htm" title="3568: Kush (N-proper-fs) -- A son of Ham, also his descendants, also a land in the southern Nile Valley">Cush.</a> </span><span class="reftext">2</span>In those days King Xerxes sat on his royal throne in the citadel of Susa.&#8230;<div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com//berean.bible">Berean Study Bible</a> &middot; <a href="https://biblehub.com//berean.bible/downloads.htm">Download</a></div><div class="vheading2">Cross References</div><div id="crf"><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a></span><br />At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, an accusation was lodged against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-3.htm">Esther 2:3</a></span><br />and let the king appoint commissioners in each province of his kingdom to assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa.

and (3) the one now before us, whom we have shown in the Introduction to be almost certainly Xerxes. For the history and character of this sovereign reference must be especially made to the contemporaneous writers, Herodotus (vii., viii. 1-90), and 'schylus in his play of <span class= "ital">The Persians.</span> The spirited lines of Juvenal should also be read (<span class= "ital">Sat.</span> x. 173-187). We find that Xerxes succeeded his father, Darius Hystaspes, in the year 485 B.C. , five years after the momentous battle of Marathon. Undeterred by his father's failure, he resolves upon a fresh attack on Greece, and sets out in 481 B.C. from Susa for the West. He winters at Sardis, leaving it in the spring of the following year. The summer sees the fight of the pass of Thermopylae, which has covered the name of Leonidas and his three hundred, though vanquished and slain, with undying glory; in the autumn Themistocles, by his victory over the Persians at Salamis, changes the history of the world, and the beginning thus made is carried on by the victories at Plataea and Mycale in 479 B.C. From the rout at Salamis, Xerxes had fled to Sardis, which he did not leave till the spring of 478 B.C. All that we know of the further course of the reign of Xerxes is but one unbroken tale of debauchery and bloodshed, which came to an end in 464 B.C, when he was murdered by two of his officers, Mithridates and Artabanus, and Artaxerxes Longimanus, his son (see Ezra 7; Nehemiah 2), reigned in his stead.<p><span class= "bld">This is Ahasuerus.</span>--This is added to make clear which particular sovereign we are here dealing with. We have seen that three of the name are mentioned in the Old Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Ethiopia.</span>--Herodotus tells us that Ethiopia paid tribute to Xerxes (iii. 97).<p><span class= "bld">An hundred and seven and twenty.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-1.htm" title="It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;">Daniel 6:1</a>. we find that Darius the Mede appointed a hundred and twenty satraps, but probably the similarity in numbers is quite accidental. There seem to have been a gradually increasing number of satrapies in the kingdom of Darius--20, 21, 23, 29 (Herod, iii. 89-94), and the nations in the empire of Xerxes are said to be sixty (<span class= "ital">ib.</span> vii. 61-95). Thus the provinces here mentioned must include subdivisions of these.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Ahasuerus</span>. Ahasuerus, in the original <span class="accented">Akhashverosh</span>, corresponds to <span class="accented">Khshayarsha</span> (the Persian name from which the Greeks formed their Xerxes) almost as closely as possible. The prosthelic a was a necessity of Hebrew articulation. The only unnecessary change was the substitution of <span class="accented">v</span> for <span class="accented">y</span> (<span class="accented">vau</span> for <span class="accented">yod</span>) in the penultimate syllable. But this interchange is very common in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">This is Ahasuerus which reigned, etc</span>. The writer is evidently acquainted with more than a single Ahasuerus. Ezra had mentioned one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a>), and Daniel another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm">Daniel 9:1</a>). If he knew their works, he would necessarily know of these two. Or he may have known of them independently. The Ahasuerus of his narrative being different from either, he proceeds to distinguish him <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the Ahasuerus of Daniel, as a "king," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the Ahasuerus of Ezra by the extent of his dominion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cambyses (see comment on Ezra 4:6) had not ruled over India. India is expressed by <span class="accented">Hoddu</span>, which seems formed from the Persian <span class="accented">Hidush</span> ('Nakhsh-i-Rus-tam Inser.,' par. 3, 1. 25), by the omission of the nominatival ending, and a slight modification of the vocalisation. The Sanscrit and the Zend, like the Greek, retained the <span class="accented">n</span>, which is really an essential part of the native word. <span class="cmt_word">Ethiopia</span> is expressed, as usual, by <span class="accented">Cush</span>. The two countries are well chosen as the extreme <span class="accented">terminal</span> of the Persian empire. <span class="cmt_word">An hundred and twenty-seven provinces</span>. The Hebrew <span class="accented">medinah</span>, "province," does not correspond to the Persian satrapy, but is applied to every tract which had its own governor. There were originally no more than twenty satrapies (Herod., 3:89-94), but there was certainly a very much larger number of governments.

There is a woe to them that do so; let them read it, and tremble, Hab 2:15,16.</body></html>
