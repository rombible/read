Herod. vii. 98). The Greek word for "compel," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-41.htm" title="And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.">Matthew 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-32.htm" title="And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.">Matthew 27:32</a>, is simply a corruption of the Persian word for the impressment of men and horses for the royal service.<p><span class= "bld">That every man should</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The following words are, literally, <span class= "ital">be ruling in his own house, and speaking according to the language of his own people.</span> The former clause may probably be taken as a proof of the existence of an undue amount of female influence generally in Persia; the second clause is more doubtful. The English Version does distinct violence to the Hebrew, perhaps because the literal rendering yielded a somewhat peculiar sense. Taking the words exactly as they stand, they can only mean that in a house where two or more languages are used, from the presence of foreign wives, the husband is to take care that his own language is not supplanted by any of theirs. This is intelligible enough, but is perhaps rather irrelevant to what goes before.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he sent</span>.

Seasons of peculiar festivity often end in vexation. Superiors should be careful not to command what may reasonably be disobeyed. But when wine is in, men's reason departs from them. He that had rule over 127 provinces, had no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policy of the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way for Esther to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even before it had entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power. Let us rejoice that the Lord reigns, and will overrule the madness or folly of mankind to promote his own glory, and the safety and happiness of his people.</body></html>
