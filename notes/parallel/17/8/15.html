The crowds who welcomed our Lord into Jerusalem on His triumphal entry soon let their enthusiasm die away--" Hosanna!" now; tomorrow, "Crucify!"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Royal apparel of blue and white</span>. The Persian monarch himself wore a purple robe and an inner vest of purple striped with white ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 153, 154). The robes of honour which he gave away were of many different colours, but generally of a single tint throughout (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:3, &sect; 3); but the one given to Mordecai seems to have been blue with white stripes. These were the colours of the royal diadem (Q. Curt., 'Vit. Alex.,' 3:3). <span class="cmt_word">A great crown of gold</span>. Not a tall crown, like that of the monarch, which is called in Hebrew <span class="accented">kether</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), but '<span class="accented">atarah</span>, a crown of an inferior kind, frequently worn by nobles<span class="cmt_word">. And with a garment of fine linen and purple</span>. The "fine linen" was of course white. The real meaning of the word <span class="accented">thakrik</span>, translated "garment," is doubtful. Gesenius understands an outer garment' 'the long and flowing robe of an Oriental monarch;" in which case the "apparel" previously mentioned must be the inner vest. Others, as Patrick, make the <span class="accented">thakrik to</span> be the inner, and the "apparel" (<span class="accented">l'bush</span>) the outer garment. The Septuagint, however, translates <span class="accented">thakrik</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and its conjunction with the "crown" favours this rendering. The <span class="accented">diadem</span> proper of a Persian monarch was a band or fillet encircling the lower part of his crown, and was of blue, spotted or striped with white. Ahasuerus seems to have allowed Mordecai to wear a diadem of white and purple. <span class="cmt_word">The city of Shushan rejoiced</span>. As the Susanchites had been "perplexed" at the first edict (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>), so were they "rejoiced" at the second. Such of them as were Persians would naturally sympathise with the Jews. Even the others may have disliked Haman's edict, and have been glad to see it, practically, reversed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:15-17 Mordecai's robes now were rich. These things are not worth notice, but as marks of the king's favour, and the fruit of God's favour to his church. It is well with a land, when ensigns of dignity are made the ornaments of serious piety. When the church prospers, many will join it, who will be shy of it when in trouble. When believers have rest, and walk in the fear of the Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, they will be multiplied. And the attempts of Satan to destroy the church, always tend to increase the number of true Christians.</body></html>
