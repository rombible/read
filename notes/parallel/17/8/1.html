When a criminal was executed, everything that belonged to him became the property of the crown, and was disposed of according to the king's pleasure.

This now becomes Haman's ordinary designation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-10.htm">Esther 9:10, 24</a>).

All the trust the king had reposed in Haman, he now placed in Mordecai: a happy change. See the vanity of laying up treasure upon earth; he that heapeth up riches, knoweth not who shall gather them. With what little pleasure, nay, with what constant vexation, would Haman have looked upon his estate, if he could have foreseen that Mordecai, the man he hated above all men in the world, should have rule over all that wherein he had laboured! It is our interest to make sure of those riches which will not be left behind, but which will go with us to another world.</body></html>
