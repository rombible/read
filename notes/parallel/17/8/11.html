As it was, it was risking civil war in all the cities of the empire, though the results were considerably lessened by numbers of people taking the hint obviously presented by the second edict. "Many of the people of the land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews came upon them."<p><span class= "bld">Take the spoil of them.</span>--We find that when the storm actually came, the Jews declined to take advantage of this part of the edict.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the king granted</span>. Rather, "that the king granted." Mordecai sent "letters," which said "that the king granted to the Jews to gather themselves together," etc. <span class="cmt_word">To gather themselves together</span>. Union is strength. If all the Jews of a province were allowed to collect and band themselves together, they would at once be a formidable body. Scattered in the various towns and villages, they might easily have been overpowered. <span class="cmt_word">To stand for their life</span>. The Jews have sometimes been spoken of as the aggressors on the actual 13th of Adar, but there is no evidence to support this view. The edict clearly only allowed them to stand on the defensive. Of course, when fighting once began, both sides did their worst. In repelling attack the Jews had the same liberty <span class="cmt_word">to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish</span> as their adversaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Little ones</span>.

Esther, though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of her people. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, but although she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pity and tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitution of the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed or recalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of the Medes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. This savours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods! It is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never be altered or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorize the Jews to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in the languages of all the provinces. Shall all the subjects of an earthly prince have his decrees in languages they understand, and shall God's oracles and laws be locked up from any of his servants in an unknown tongue?</body></html>
