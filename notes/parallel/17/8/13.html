And the following is the copy of the letter of the orders. The great king Artaxerxes sends greetings to the rulers of provinces <i>in</i> a hundred and twenty-seven satrapies, from India to Ethiopia, even to those who are faithful to our interests. Many who have been frequently honored by the most abundant kindness of their benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavour to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavour to plot against their own benefactors. And they not only would utterly abolish gratitude from among men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they supposed that they shall escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God. And oftentimes <i>evil</i> exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities, many of those who had been appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends' affairs; while <i>men</i>, by the false sophistry of an evil disposition, have deceived the simple candour of the ruling powers. And it is possible to see <i>this</i>, not so much from more ancient traditionary accounts, as it is immediately in your power <i>to see it</i> by examining what things have been wickedly perpetrated by the baseness of men unworthily holding power. And <i>it is right</i> to take heed with regard to the future, that we may maintain the government in undistributed peace for all men, adopting <i>needful</i> changes, and ever judging those cases which come under our notices, with truly equitable decision. For whereas Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadathes, in reality an alien from the blood of the Persians, and differing widely from our mild course of government, having been hospitable entertained by us, obtained so large a share of our universal kindness, as to be called our father, and to continue the person next to the royal throne, reverenced of all; <i>he however</i>, overcome by the pride <i>of his station</i>, endeavored to deprive us of our dominion, and our life: having by various and subtle artifices demanded for destruction both Mardochaeus our deliverer and perpetual benefactor, and Esther the blameless consort of <i>our</i> kingdom, with their whole nation. For by these methods he thought, having surprised us in a defenceless state, to transfer the dominion of the Persians to the Macedonians. But we find that the Jews, who have been consigned to destruction by the most abominable of men, are not malefactors, but living according to the justest laws, and being the sons of the living God, the most high and mighty, who maintains the kingdom. to us as well as to our forefathers, in the most excellent order. Ye will therefore do well in refusing to obey the letter sent by Aman the son of Amadathes, because he that has done these things, has been hanged with his whole family at the gates of Susa, Almighty God having swiftly returned to him a worthy recompence, <i>We enjoin you</i> then, having openly published a copy of this letter in every place, to give the Jews permission to use their own lawful customs, and to strengthen them, that on the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar, on the self-same day, they may defend themselves against those who attack them in a time of affliction. For in the place of the destruction of the chosen race, Almighty God has granted them this <i>time of</i> gladness. Do ye therefore also, among your <i>notable</i> feasts, keep a distinct day with all festivity, that both now and hereafter it may be a day of deliverance to us and who are well disposed toward the Persians, but to those that plotted against us a memorial of destruction. And every city and province collectively, which shall not do accordingly, shall be consumed with vengeance by spear and fire: it shall be made not only inaccessible to men, but most hateful to wild beasts and birds for ever. And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/drb/esther/8.htm">Douay-Rheims Bible</a></span><br />And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/dbt/esther/8.htm">Darby Bible Translation</a></span><br />That the decree might be given in every province, a copy of the writing was published to all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/erv/esther/8.htm">English Revised Version</a></span><br />A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/wbt/esther/8.htm">Webster's Bible Translation</a></span><br />The copy of the writing for a commandment, to be given in every province was published to all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/web/esther/8.htm">World English Bible</a></span><br />A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ylt/esther/8.htm">Young's Literal Translation</a></span><br /> a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and province is revealed to all the peoples, and for the Jews being ready at this day to be avenged of their enemies.</div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheadingv"><b>Study Bible</b></div><span class="hdg"><a href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/esther/8.htm">The Decree of Xerxes</a></span><br>&#8230;<span class="reftext">12</span>The single day appointed throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. <span class="reftext">13</span><span class="highl"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6572.htm" title="6572: patShegen (N-msc) -- A transcript">A copy</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3791.htm" title="3791: hakkeTav (Art :: N-ms) -- Something written, a writing, record, book">of the text,</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5414.htm" title="5414: lehinNaten (Prep-l :: V-Nifal-Inf) -- To give, put, set">issued</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1881.htm" title="1881: dat (N-fs) -- A royal edict, statute">as law</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3605.htm" title="3605: bechol (Prep-b :: N-msc) -- The whole, all, any, every">throughout every</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/4082.htm" title="4082: mediNah (N-fs) -- A judgeship, jurisdiction, a district, a region">province,</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1540.htm" title="1540: gaLui (V-Qal-QalPassPrtcpl-ms) -- To denude, to exile, to reveal">was distributed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3605.htm" title="3605: lechol (Prep-l :: N-msc) -- The whole, all, any, every">to all</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5971.htm" title="5971: haamMim (Art :: N-mp) -- A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock">the peoples,</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3064.htm" title="3064: haiyehuDim (Art :: N-proper-mp) -- Jews -- Jewish">so that the Jews</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1961.htm" title="1961: velihYot (Conj-w, Prep-l :: V-Qal-Inf) -- To fall out, come to pass, become, be">would be</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6259.htm" title="6259: atiDim (Adj-mp) -- Prepared">prepared</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/2088.htm" title="2088: hazZeh (Art :: Pro-ms) -- This, that">on that</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3117.htm" title="3117: laiYom (Prep-l, Art :: N-ms) -- A day">day</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5358.htm" title="5358: lehinnaKem (Prep-l :: V-Nifal-Inf) -- To grudge, avenge, punish">to avenge themselves</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/341.htm" title="341: meoyeveiHem (Prep-m :: V-Qal-Prtcpl-mpc :: 3mp) -- Hating, an adversary">on their enemies.</a> </span><span class="reftext">14</span>The couriers rode out in haste on their royal horses, pressed on by the command of the king.
