"<span class="accented">See</span> now," he said, "I have done what I could - I have given Esther Haman's house; I have had Haman himself executed because he put forth his hand against the Jews. What yet remains? I am asked to save your countrymen by revoking my late edict. That may not be. <span class="cmt_word">The writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's seal, may no man reverse</span>. But, short of this, I give you full liberty of action<span class="cmt_word">. Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring</span>. Surely you can devise something which will save your people without calling on me to retract my own words, and at the same time break a great principle of Persian law." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:3-14 It was time to be earnest, when the church of God was at stake. Esther, though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of her people. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, but although she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pity and tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitution of the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed or recalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of the Medes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. This savours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods! It is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never be altered or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorize the Jews to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in the languages of all the provinces. Shall all the subjects of an earthly prince have his decrees in languages they understand, and shall God's oracles and laws be locked up from any of his servants in an unknown tongue?</body></html>
