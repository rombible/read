It may be assumed that Mordecai was a eunuch, by the way in which he was allowed access to the royal harem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-11.htm" title="And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.">Esther 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-22.htm" title="And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it to Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.">Esther 2:22</a>). The name Mordecai occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm" title="Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.

The character of Mordecai strikes us at the outset as that of an ambitious, worldly man; who, though numbers of his tribe had returned to the land of their fathers, preferred to remain behind on the alien soil. The heroic lament of the exiles by Babel's streams, who would not sing the Lord's song in a strange land, who looked with horror at the thought that Jerusalem should be forgotten--such were not Mordecai's thoughts, far from it: why endure hardships, when there is a chance of his adopted daughter's beauty catching the eye of the sensual king, when through her he may vanquish his rival, and become that king's chief minister?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/esther/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now in Shushan... there was a certain Jew</span>. Hitherto the narrative has been a mere story of the Persian court. Now at last a Jew is brought on the scene, very abruptly; and the history is to a certain extent attached to the other sacred books, and assigned its place, by the genealogy which follows. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name was Mordecai</span>. The name Mordecai must almost certainly be connected with that of Marduk, or Merodach, the Babylonian and Assyrian god. But it may have been given to his son by a Baby-Ionian Jew without any thought of its derivation or meaning, perhaps out of compliment to a Babylonian friend or master. Another Mordecai, also a Jew, is mentioned by Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>) and Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-20 We see to what absurd practices those came, who were destitute of Divine revelation, and what need there was of the gospel of Christ, to purify men from the lusts of the flesh, and to bring them back to the original institution of marriage. Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.</body></html>
