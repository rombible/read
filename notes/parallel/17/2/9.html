And she obtained kindness of him</span>. This is a phrase peculiar to the Book of Esther, and a favourite one with the author (see vers. 15, 17; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a>). It is better translated "she obtained favour" (as in all the other places where it occurs) than "she obtained kindness," though the latter translation is more literal<span class="cmt_word">.

Literally, as in the margin, "with her portions" - by which is probably meant her daily allowance of food. <span class="cmt_word">And seven maidens</span>. Rather, "and her seven maidens." It is implied that each virgin had seven female attendants assigned to her. <span class="cmt_word">Meet to be given her</span>. It was in this point that the "favour" or "kindness of Hegel was shown. He selected for her use the most suitable of the attendants. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-20 We see to what absurd practices those came, who were destitute of Divine revelation, and what need there was of the gospel of Christ, to purify men from the lusts of the flesh, and to bring them back to the original institution of marriage. Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.</body></html>
