"Hadassah" has been compared with "Atossa," and "Esther" with "Amestris;" but there is probably no more <span class="accented">ground</span> for the one identification than the other. Mordecai's cousin received originally the Hebrew name of "Hadassah," a derivative of <span class="accented">hadas</span> "myrtle" (compare "<span class="accented">Susannah"</span> from <span class="accented">shushan</span>, "lily"); but was subsequently called by the Persians "Esther," which may either be <span class="accented">Ishtar</span>, "Venus," or an equivalent of the Zend <span class="accented">ctare</span>, Mod.

Not perhaps By a formal adoption, but by taking her to live with him, and treating her as if she had been his own child. This fact is related to account for the terms of familiarity between the two, which form an essential part of the later narrative. It introduces Mordecai to the reader under a favourable aspect, as kindly and benevolent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-20 We see to what absurd practices those came, who were destitute of Divine revelation, and what need there was of the gospel of Christ, to purify men from the lusts of the flesh, and to bring them back to the original institution of marriage. Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.</body></html>
