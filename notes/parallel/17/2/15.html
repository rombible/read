Literally, "the paternal uncle," or "father's brother." The genealogy may be thus exhibited: - Kish &#8212;> Shimei &#8212;> {(Jair&#8212;>Abihail) (Mordecai&#8212;>Esther)} <span class="cmt_word">Who had taken her for his daughter</span> (see the comment on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">She required nothing</span>, etc. Esther would not trust to the extraneous and adventitious beauty of dress or ornaments, or at any rate would give herself no trouble about such things. If she succeeded, it should be without effort. Hegai might dress her as he pleased. She left all to him. <span class="cmt_word">Esther obtained favour</span>, etc. Either this is intended as a general assertion - "No one could ever see Esther without admiring her and feeling favourably disposed towards her," - or it has special reference to the particular occasion - "No one who saw Esther on this evening but admired her and felt well disposed towards her." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/esther/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-20 We see to what absurd practices those came, who were destitute of Divine revelation, and what need there was of the gospel of Christ, to purify men from the lusts of the flesh, and to bring them back to the original institution of marriage. Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.</body></html>
