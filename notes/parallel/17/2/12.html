A year's purification was considered necessary before any maiden could approach the king (see the comment on ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">Six months with oil of myrrh</span>. Myrrh was highly esteemed, both for its scent and for its purifying power, by the ancients. In Egypt it was employed largely in the preparation of mummies (Herod., 2:86). The Jews were directed to make it one of the chief ingredients in their "holy anointing oil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>). Dresses and beds were scented with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-17.htm">Proverbs 7:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And six months with sweet odours</span>.

Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.</body></html>
