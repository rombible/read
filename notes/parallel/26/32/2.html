A striking contrast is brought out in this verse which is lost in our translation. "Thou wast compared to a young lion of the nations," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> their leader and glory; "but thou wast (really) like a crocodile in the seas," stirring up and fouling the rivers, the sources of their prosperity.<p><span class= "bld">Thou carmest forth with.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">thou didst break forth in thy rivers,</span> referring to the crocodile basking upon the bank, and suddenly plunging into the stream and stirring up its mud.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art like a young lion</span>; rather, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">thou wast likened unto a young lion</span>. The two clauses of the verse stand in direct contrast to each other. Flatterers, <span class="accented">orators</span>, courtiers, had used the usual symbolism of the animal world. The King of Egypt was as the king of beasts. Ezekiel rejects that comparison, and likens him rather to the <span class="cmt_word">whale</span>, the dragon (Revised Version), in the seas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the crocodile of his own river (compare the use of the "dragon" for the King of Egypt, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>).

As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-18.htm">Ezekiel 34:18</a>, the act is used as the symbol of all selfish and aggressive rule, defiling the streams of righteousness and judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Thou camest forth with thy rivers.</span> Ewald and Smend translate, "Thou didst spurt out the water," as describing the act of the crocodile when it raises its head out of the water as in the "neesings," or "sneezings" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>, Hebrew [English version, 18]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-16 It becomes us to weep and tremble for those who will not weep and tremble for themselves. Great oppressors are, in God's account, no better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp of this world, will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those who know the vanity of all things here below, is no surprise. When others are ruined by sin, we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. The instruments of the desolation are formidable. And the instances of the desolation are frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, which signifies there should be universal sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation. God can soon empty those of this world's goods who have the greatest fulness of them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, we increase the occasions of our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God, are the most powerful of mankind! The destruction of Egypt was a type of the destruction of the enemies of Christ.</body></html>
