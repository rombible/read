In this and the following verse the judgments of God are described in the common prophetic figure of changes in the heavenly bodies. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-18.htm" title="At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.">Ezekiel 30:18</a>, and references there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I shall put thee out</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">extinguish</span>. The verb is used of lamps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>. The change of metaphor is at first startling, but I follow Ewald, Hitzig, and Smend, in thinking that there is a traceable sequence of ideas. The "dragon of the Egyptian waters" suggested the "dragon" which was conspicuous between Ursa Major and Minor among the constellations of the heavens, and the name of which, probably derived by the Greek astronomers from a remote past, suggested that of an enemy of God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). So taken, the new comparison finds a parallel in that of the King of Babylon to Lucifer, the morning star, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>. Upon this there follows naturally the imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. As the other trees of the forest had mourned for the cedar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>), so the other lights of heaven mourn for that particular star which has been quenched for ever (comp. for the general imagery. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>, Hebrew ['English version, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2.htm">Ezekiel 2</a>:31]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-16 It becomes us to weep and tremble for those who will not weep and tremble for themselves. Great oppressors are, in God's account, no better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp of this world, will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those who know the vanity of all things here below, is no surprise. When others are ruined by sin, we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. The instruments of the desolation are formidable. And the instances of the desolation are frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, which signifies there should be universal sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation. God can soon empty those of this world's goods who have the greatest fulness of them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, we increase the occasions of our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God, are the most powerful of mankind! The destruction of Egypt was a type of the destruction of the enemies of Christ.</body></html>
