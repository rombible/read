Thus in Ver. 13 we are thrown back upon the thought of the "troubled waters" of Ver. 2. The Nile was no longer to be troubled by the foot of beasts; the streams of justice were no longer to be defiled with a selfish corruption, but were to run smooth and calm, even as the "rivers of oil" which were the symbols of ethical blessedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>). So Ewald and Keil, for once agreeing. The rule of Nebuchadnezzar was to be a righteous rule, in spite of its severity. I am unable, however, to follow these commentators further in seeing in the words a prediction of the Messianic kingdom. The Egyptians were to "know the Lord," as the other nations addressed by Ezekiel were to know him, as a righteous Judge, not as yet as a Deliverer (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-26.htm">Ezekiel 30:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-16 It becomes us to weep and tremble for those who will not weep and tremble for themselves. Great oppressors are, in God's account, no better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp of this world, will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those who know the vanity of all things here below, is no surprise. When others are ruined by sin, we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. The instruments of the desolation are formidable. And the instances of the desolation are frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, which signifies there should be universal sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation. God can soon empty those of this world's goods who have the greatest fulness of them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, we increase the occasions of our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God, are the most powerful of mankind! The destruction of Egypt was a type of the destruction of the enemies of Christ.</body></html>
