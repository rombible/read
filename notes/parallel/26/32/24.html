Elam is substantially equivalent to Persia, and had been repeatedly conquered by Assyria and Chaldaea. It was a fierce and warlike nation, and its soldiers had long served in Nebuchadnezzar's army. It was by the aid of Persia that he had succeeded in overthrowing Assyria. It was by a subsequent union of the same Power with the Medes that the Babylonian power was overthrown. Not until after that union did Persia become a very prominent nation. It continued a great Power until its conquest by Alexander. The prophet is therefore anticipating the events of the future when he represents Elam as already in the pit. But, as before said, his thought looks on to the ultimate result, without making prominent the comparative dates of the future. It is possible, however, so far to separate Elam from Persia as to look upon the former as one of those nations out of whose ruins the latter arose, and in this case Elam was already past. The former interpretation seems preferable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is Elam</span> etc. The nation so named appears grouped with Asshur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a> it stands between Cush and Shinar; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a> its warriors form part of the host of Sennacherib; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a> they are named as having been among the settlers in Samaria; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a> as joining with the Medes in the attack on Babylon; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a> again coupled with the Medes among the enemies of Nebuchadnezzar; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a> as the province in which Shushan was situated, and therefore subject to Babylon. Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:34-39) had uttered a special prophecy against it. From Ezekiel's point of view it might well take its place among the powers that had received their death-blow at the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Yet have they borne their shame</span>; sc. the disgrace of being uncircumcised, and therefore taking their place with the lower circles of the dead. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:17-32 Divers nations are mentioned as gone down to the grave before Egypt, who are ready to give her a scornful reception; these nations had been lately ruined and wasted. But though Judah and Jerusalem were about this time ruined and laid waste, yet they are not mentioned here. Though they suffered the same affliction, and by the same hand, yet the kind design for which they were afflicted, and the mercy God reserved for them, altered its nature. It was not to them a going down to the pit, as it was to the heathen. Pharaoh shall see, and be comforted; but the comfort wicked ones have after death, is poor comfort, not real, but only in fancy. The view this prophecy gives of ruined states shows something of this present world, and the empire of death in it. Come and see the calamitous state of human life. As if men did not die fast enough, they are ingenious at finding out ways to destroy one another. Also of the other world; though the destruction of nations as such, seems chiefly intended, here is plain allusion to the everlasting ruin of impenitent sinners. How are men deceived by Satan! What are the objects they pursue through scenes of bloodshed, and their many sins? Surely man disquiets himself in vain, whether he pursues wealth, fame, power, or pleasure. The hour cometh, when all that are in their graves shall hear the voice of Christ, and shall come forth; those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and those that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.</body></html>
