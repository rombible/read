(For the political relations of Edom at this time, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-14</a>.) Whatever shadow of power might yet remain to it, Ezekiel, from his standpoint, could yet declare that her greatness had departed. The exultation which the Edomites had shown over the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>) would naturally tend to accentuate the prophet's language. The "princes" of Edom are probably identical with the "dukes" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15-43</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51</a>, where the word means literally the heads or captains of thousands, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of tribes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-5.htm">Zechariah 12:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:17-32 Divers nations are mentioned as gone down to the grave before Egypt, who are ready to give her a scornful reception; these nations had been lately ruined and wasted. But though Judah and Jerusalem were about this time ruined and laid waste, yet they are not mentioned here. Though they suffered the same affliction, and by the same hand, yet the kind design for which they were afflicted, and the mercy God reserved for them, altered its nature. It was not to them a going down to the pit, as it was to the heathen. Pharaoh shall see, and be comforted; but the comfort wicked ones have after death, is poor comfort, not real, but only in fancy. The view this prophecy gives of ruined states shows something of this present world, and the empire of death in it. Come and see the calamitous state of human life. As if men did not die fast enough, they are ingenious at finding out ways to destroy one another. Also of the other world; though the destruction of nations as such, seems chiefly intended, here is plain allusion to the everlasting ruin of impenitent sinners. How are men deceived by Satan! What are the objects they pursue through scenes of bloodshed, and their many sins? Surely man disquiets himself in vain, whether he pursues wealth, fame, power, or pleasure. The hour cometh, when all that are in their graves shall hear the voice of Christ, and shall come forth; those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and those that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.</body></html>
