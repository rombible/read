True religion and a service acceptable to God must spring from a subjection of the affections of the heart to His will. Accordingly, the promise to Israel of old was: "The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>). This, too, had been the prayer of the devout penitent, "Create in me a clean heart "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm" title="Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.">Psalm 51:10</a>). But this change is necessarily the most difficult to effect in man, and consequently the promise, though with some degree of accomplishment as the ages roll by, still looks forward to the future. Ezekiel here, and with more fulness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-26.htm" title="A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, speaks of it as a part of the blessing of the restoration. A marked progress was then made towards it in the hearty abandonment of idolatry, and the better Appreciation of religion as a matter of internal heart. service; but the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm" title="But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, said the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, given about the same time, shows that it looked forward to the Messianic days for a more complete realisation. And certainly under the Christian dispensation a great advance has been made in this respect; but even the closing Book of Revelation still points forward to the future state of existence, when this promise shall attain its full realisation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3</a>). It is remarkable that this closing prophecy of the inspired volume follows exactly the plan here laid out, of adding to this glorious promise the warning to "the fearful and unbelieving." What Ezekiel foretells of the time of the restoration must therefore be considered as not expected then to receive its ultimate and complete fulfilment, but only a fulfilment in a degree, to be ever after more and more realised, until it shall reach its consummation in the heavenly state.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">One heart.</span>--Unity of purpose among the restored exiles was to be at once a consequence and a condition of their improved moral condition. The opposite evil is spoken of as one of the sins of the people in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm" title="All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.">Isaiah 53:6</a> : We have turned every one to his own way." Self-will, which leads to division, and submission to God's will are necessarily contradictory terms. Hence the corresponding promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-39.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:">Jeremiah 32:39</a> : "I will give them one heart and one way," and the blessed realisation of this, described in the first fervency of the early Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm" title="And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.">Acts 4:32</a>): "The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul."<p><span class= "bld">Stony heart . . . heart of flesh.</span>--This phraseology is peculiar to Ezekiel, but the same thing is often described in other terms. The figure here seems to be that of a <span class= "ital">stony </span>heart as unnatural, in the higher sense of that word, unfitting, and incongruous; this is to be removed, and in its place is to be substituted "an heart of flesh "--one that can be moved by the Divine appeals, and is suitable to the whole being and condition of the people. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm" title="A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.">Ezekiel 36:26</a>.) The effect of this change will be obedience to the Divine will, and consequently a realisation of the covenant relation in a fellowship with God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will give</span> <span class="cmt_word">them one heart.</span> The LXX., following a different reading, gives "another heart" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-9.htm">1 Samuel 10:9</a>); but the Hebrew, represented by the Authorized and Revised Versions, is, without any doubt, right. As in the symbolic action of the joining of the two sticks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-22</a>, so here, the hope of the prophet, like that of Isaiah and Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37-39</a>), looked forward to the unity of the restored people. Judah should no longer vex Ephraim, nor Ephraim Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a>). The long standing line of cleavage should disappear. Oneness of purpose and of action would characterize the new Israel of God. So, in our Lord's prayer for his Church, there is the prayer that "they may be one" - made perfect in one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>). Left to itself, Israel tended, as all human communities have tended, to an ever-subdividing individualism, fruitful in sects and parties and schisms. Even the highest of those aspirations has remained as yet without any adequate fulfilment. The ideal unity of the Christian Church is as far distant as that of the Church of Israel. It remains for us to welcome any approximate fulfilments as pledges and earnests of the future unity of the true Israel of God in the heavenly Jerusalem. In the prophet's thoughts that unity was to be brought about by the Divine gift of a "new Spirit," loyal, obedient, unselfish. We note how distinctly, whether consciously or unconsciously, Ezekiel reproduces the thought, almost the very words, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37-39</a>; how his words are in their turn reproduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-5</a>. The eternal hope asserts itself again and again in spite of all partial failures and disappointments. <span class="cmt_word">I will take the stony heart out of their flesh.</span> The thought is, as we have seen, identical with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>, but the form in this instance is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel, and meets us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>. The "stony heart" is that which is "hardened" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>) against all impressions of repentance, to all natural or spiritual aspirations of the good. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a> speaks of those who had made their hearts "harder than an adamant stone." So we may remember, by way of illustration, that Burns says of the sin of impurity that "it hardens a' within," that "it <span class="accented">petrifies</span> the feeling." Ezekiel had seen enough of that stoniness in others, perhaps had, at times, felt it in himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:14-21 The pious captives in Babylon were insulted by the Jews who continued in Jerusalem; but God made gracious promises to them. It is promised, that God will give them one heart; a heart firmly fixed for God, and not wavering. All who are made holy have a new spirit, a new temper and dispositions; they act from new principles, walk by new rules, and aim at new ends. A new name, or a new face, will not serve without a new spirit. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. The carnal heart, like a stone, cannot be made to feel. Men live among the dead and dying, and are neither concerned nor humbled. He will make their hearts tender and fit to receive impressions: this is God's work, it is his gift by promise; and a wonderful and happy change is wrought by it, from death to life. Their practices shall be agreeable to those principles. These two must and will go together. When the sinner feels his need of these blessings, let him present the promises as prayers in the name of Christ, they will be performed.</body></html>
