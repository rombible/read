and then, finally--what was most terrible to a Jew--they were to be arraigned and punished "in the border," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>at the extremity or outside of the land of Israel. Historically, it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-20.htm" title="And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:">2Kings 25:20-21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/52-9.htm" title="Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment on him.">Jeremiah 52:9-11</a>, that the general of Nebuchadnezzar, after the capture of the city, carried the people of the land to the king at Riblah, just on the northern confines of Palestine. There Nebuchadnezzar pronounced his cruel judgments upon them, slaying the king's sons before his eyes, and executing many others, and then, putting out Zedekiah's eyes, carried him and the rest captive to Babylon. By all this, not in repentance, but through the experiencing of the Divine judgments, they should be at last forced to recognise Jehovah as the Almighty Ruler and Disposer of events. This place of the judgment, and this consequence of it, are emphatically repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/11-11.htm" title="This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall you be the flesh in the middle thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:">Ezekiel 11:11-12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-13 Where Satan cannot persuade men to look upon the judgment to come as uncertain, he gains his point by persuading them to look upon it as at a distance. These wretched rulers dare to say, We are as safe in this city as flesh in a boiling pot; the walls of the city shall be to us as walls of brass, we shall receive no more damage from the besiegers than the caldron does from the fire. When sinners flatter themselves to their own ruin, it is time to tell them they shall have no peace if they go on. None shall remain in possession of the city but those who are buried in it. Those are least safe who are most secure. God is often pleased to single out some sinners for warning to others. Whether Pelatiah died at that time in Jerusalem, or when the fulfilment of the prophecy drew near, is uncertain. Like Ezekiel, we ought to be much affected with the sudden death of others, and we should still plead with the Lord to have mercy on those who remain.</body></html>
