The expression is literally <span class= "ital">not near to build houses; </span>and it is to be explained by the prophecy and narrative of Jeremiah 29. After the 10,000 (among whom was Ezekiel) had been carried captive--and apparently shortly after--Jeremiah had sent word to the captives to build houses and make themselves comfortable. because the captivity would be long (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/11-5.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak; Thus said the LORD; Thus have you said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.">Ezekiel 11:5-10</a>). This greatly offended the captives; and Shemaiah, a false prophet among them, had consequently sent letters to Jerusalem asking that Jeremiah might be punished for thus prophesying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/11-24.htm" title="Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.">Ezekiel 11:24-25</a>). The princes of the people now appear in Ezekiel's vision as taking up this prophecy of Jeremiah's and contradicting it: "this need of building houses for a long captivity is not near!" In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/7-2.htm" title="Also, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD to the land of Israel; An end, the end is come on the four corners of the land.">Ezekiel 7:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-12.htm" title="The time is come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is on all the multitude thereof.">Ezekiel 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-23.htm" title="Tell them therefore, Thus said the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.">Ezekiel 12:23</a>, Ezekiel expressly declares that it is very near. The princes further confirmed the people in their fancied security by comparing the city to a caldron, the strong walls of which should protect the flesh within it, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the people, from the fire of all hostile attack. In the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-6.htm" title="Why thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.">Ezekiel 24:6</a> this figure is taken up, and a very different application given to it; it is also turned against them immediately in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the middle of it.">Ezekiel 11:7</a>. In consequence of this attitude and these sayings of the princes, the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/11-5.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak; Thus said the LORD; Thus have you said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.">Ezekiel 11:5-12</a> is now directed against them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is not near,</span> etc. The words take their place among the popular, half-proverbial sayings of which we have other examples in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>; and Ezekiel 18:2. As in most proverbs of this kind, the thought is condensed to the very verge of obscurity, and the words have received very different interpretations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That suggested by the Authorized Version. "It (the judgment of which the true prophets spoke) is not near. Let us build houses, not, as Jeremiah bids (Jeremiah 39:5), in the land of exile, but here in Jerusalem, where we shall remain in safety. Are we threatened with the imagery of the 'seething pot' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13</a>)? Let us remember that the caldron protects the meat in it from the fire. The walls of the city will protect us from the army of the Chaldeans." The temper which clothed itself in this language was that of the self-confident boastful security of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-3.htm">Jeremiah 28:3</a>; and the death of Hananiah, the son of Azur, in that history presents a parallel to that of Pelatiah in this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Grammatically, however, the rendering of the Revised Version is preferable: <span class="accented">The time is not near for building houses</span>; probably, as before, with a reference to Jeremiah's advice. "We," they seem to say, "are not come to that plaint yet. We will trust, as in (1), in our interpretation of the caldron." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> On the whole, I incline, while adopting the Revised Version rendering, to interpret the words, as Smend takes them, as the defiant utterance of despair: "It is no time for building houses, here or elsewhere. We are doomed. We are destined (I borrow the nearest analogue of modern proverbial speech) 'to stew in our own juice.' Well, let us meet it as we best may." I find what suggests this view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the improbability that the thought of the caldron could ever have been received as a message of safety (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3, 6</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the despairing tone of most of the sayings that Ezekiel records (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>). Probably there were, as in other like crises in the history of nations (say, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in those of the Franco-German War) rapid alternations between the two moods of boastful security and defiant despair - the <span class="accented">galgenhumor</span>, the courage of the gallows, as Smend calls it; and the same words might be uttered now in this temper, and now in that. In either case, there was the root element of the absence of repentance and submission. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-13 Where Satan cannot persuade men to look upon the judgment to come as uncertain, he gains his point by persuading them to look upon it as at a distance. These wretched rulers dare to say, We are as safe in this city as flesh in a boiling pot; the walls of the city shall be to us as walls of brass, we shall receive no more damage from the besiegers than the caldron does from the fire. When sinners flatter themselves to their own ruin, it is time to tell them they shall have no peace if they go on. None shall remain in possession of the city but those who are buried in it. Those are least safe who are most secure. God is often pleased to single out some sinners for warning to others. Whether Pelatiah died at that time in Jerusalem, or when the fulfilment of the prophecy drew near, is uncertain. Like Ezekiel, we ought to be much affected with the sudden death of others, and we should still plead with the Lord to have mercy on those who remain.</body></html>
