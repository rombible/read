I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.">Ezekiel 11:17</a>, refer to what the people of Jerusalem had said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-15.htm" title="Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: to us is this land given in possession.">Ezekiel 11:15</a>. Their saying these things was a reason, not for what God would do, but for His declaring His merciful purpose beforehand.<p><span class= "bld">As a little sanctuary.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">as a sanctuary for a little. </span>The original word is to be taken as an adverb rather than an adjective, and in itself may refer either to time or to amount: either a sanctuary for a little time, or a sanctuary in some degree. The connection points to the former as the true sense; for a little while, during the term of their captivity, God's presence with them spiritually would be instead of the outward symbolical presence in His Temple. The contrast is striking. God has already said that he would abandon the Temple, and give up Jerusalem to destruction, and cast out its people; but now to the exiles, scattered among the heathen, He would Himself be for a sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet will</span> <span class="cmt_word">I be unto them as a little sanctuary</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">a little while</span>, as marking that the state described was transient and provisional. For a time, Ezekiel and the exiles were to find the presence of Jehovah manifested as in the vision of Chebar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>), or felt spiritually, and this would make the spot where they found themselves as fully a holy place as the temple had been. There also they would have a "house of God." But this was not to be their permanent lot. There was to be a restoration to "the land of Israel" (ver. 17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>), to the visible sanctuary, to a second temple no longer desecrated by the pollutions that had defiled the first. As with all such prophecies, the words had "springing and germinant accomplishments." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>, we have Ezekiel's ideal vision of their fulfilment. A literal but incomplete fulfilment is formed in the work of restoration achieved by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and the hopes then cherished by Haggai and Zechariah. A more complete but less literal fulfilment appears in the Church of Christ as the true Israel of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>), and in the Jerusalem which is above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>). In the fact that in the seer's vision of that heavenly city there is no temple, but the presence of "the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>), we find the crowning development of Ezekiel's thought. Intermediate expansions are found <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the gradual substitution of the synagogue for the temple in the religious life of Israel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in our Lord's words to the woman of Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in his promise that where two or three are gathered together in his Name, there he would be in the midst of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). The thought that it is the presence of Jehovah that makes the sanctuary, not the sanctuary that secures the presence, Ezekiel may have learnt from the fate of Shiloh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:14-21 The pious captives in Babylon were insulted by the Jews who continued in Jerusalem; but God made gracious promises to them. It is promised, that God will give them one heart; a heart firmly fixed for God, and not wavering. All who are made holy have a new spirit, a new temper and dispositions; they act from new principles, walk by new rules, and aim at new ends. A new name, or a new face, will not serve without a new spirit. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. The carnal heart, like a stone, cannot be made to feel. Men live among the dead and dying, and are neither concerned nor humbled. He will make their hearts tender and fit to receive impressions: this is God's work, it is his gift by promise; and a wonderful and happy change is wrought by it, from death to life. Their practices shall be agreeable to those principles. These two must and will go together. When the sinner feels his need of these blessings, let him present the promises as prayers in the name of Christ, they will be performed.</body></html>
