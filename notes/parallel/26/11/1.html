and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.">Ezekiel 10:19</a>). It is not expressly said where he was brought from; but the last place mentioned was the court of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm" title="And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.">Ezekiel 8:16</a>), and so far the vision appears to be consecutive. Standing in that innermost court, he had seen the Divine presence go forth to the outer entrance; and he also is now transported thither.<p>Here he sees twenty-five men, the same number whom he had seen worshipping the sun in the inner court. They appear, however, to have been priests, while these seem to be secular leaders. Hence they are generally supposed to be a different set of men. It is nevertheless by no means impossible that they may be the same idolatrous priests, who, by prostituting their holy office to idolatry, gained an ascendancy over a sinful people. Otherwise, the number twenty-five may represent the king, with two princes from each of the twelve tribes; or is possibly a number without any other especial significance than as representing a considerable array of the most prominent people of the nation. Two of these are mentioned by name. If the Jaazaniah here is the same with the Jaazaniah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm" title="And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.">Ezekiel 8:11</a>, it settles the point that the men here are not to be understood of the priests, since he there represented a different class (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm" title="And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.">Ezekiel 8:11</a>). The names are significant: Jaazaniah = Jehovah hears, son of Azur = the helper; Pelatiah = God rescues, son of Benaiah =Jehovah builds. Names of this sort were common enough among the Jews, but they seem here intended to bring out the false hopes with which the people beguiled themselves; and in view of this, the sudden death of Pelatiah (verse. 13) was particularly impressive. These princes were active in misleading the people to their destruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the Spirit lifted me up,</span> etc. It is noticeable that the position to which Ezekiel was thus transported in his vision from his place in the inner court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), was identical with that which he had just seen occupied by the cherub chariot before its departure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>). What he is about to see will throw light on the significance of their departure. The gate is probably, here as there, that of the court of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Five and twenty men.</span> The number at first reminds us of the worshippers of the sun, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; but that, as we saw, was probably a company of priests. On the other hand, the two who are named are styled <span class="cmt_word">princes of the people,</span> which suggests a lay rather than a priestly status, and they are seen in a different locality. Conjectures as to the significance of the number vary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Two from each tribe of Israel, with the king at their head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Two from each of the twelve divisions of the army, each containing twenty-four thousand men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Representatives of twelve regions of the city - a kind of municipal council, with their president. Possibly, after all, the number was used more or less vaguely - a "round" number, as we say (Smend). It is probably safe, however, to think of them as representing the lay element of authority. Nothing is known further as to the persons named. Jaazaniah is distinguished by his parentage from his namesake of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>. Both were probably familiar to those for whom Ezekiel wrote, as leaders of the party that was "always devising mischief," in opposition, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to Jeremiah and the true prophets. Possibly the meanings of the names <span class="cmt_word">Jaazaniah</span> (equivalent to "God hearkens") the son of Azur (equivalent to "The Helper"), <span class="cmt_word">Pelatiah</span> (equivalent to "God rescues") <span class="cmt_word">the son of Benaiah</span> (equivalent to "God builds"), are chosen as with a grim irony. The name of Azur meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a> as that of the father of the false prophet Hananiah. The death of Pelatiah was probably an historical event to which the prophet pointed as a warning to those who, either at Jerusalem or among the exiles, were speaking as he spoke. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-13 Where Satan cannot persuade men to look upon the judgment to come as uncertain, he gains his point by persuading them to look upon it as at a distance. These wretched rulers dare to say, We are as safe in this city as flesh in a boiling pot; the walls of the city shall be to us as walls of brass, we shall receive no more damage from the besiegers than the caldron does from the fire. When sinners flatter themselves to their own ruin, it is time to tell them they shall have no peace if they go on. None shall remain in possession of the city but those who are buried in it. Those are least safe who are most secure. God is often pleased to single out some sinners for warning to others. Whether Pelatiah died at that time in Jerusalem, or when the fulfilment of the prophecy drew near, is uncertain. Like Ezekiel, we ought to be much affected with the sudden death of others, and we should still plead with the Lord to have mercy on those who remain.</body></html>
