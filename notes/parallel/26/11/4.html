As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>, the Spirit of Jehovah comes upon him, and throws him into the prophetic ecstasy. It is noticeable that here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3</a>, his message is not to Judah only, but to the whole <span class="cmt_word">house of Israel</span> as represented by those to whom he spoke. <span class="cmt_word">I know the things</span>. This, as ever, was one of the notes of a true prophet, that he shared, as was needed for his work, in the knowledge of him from whom no secrets are hid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-4.htm">Matthew 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">1 Corinthians 14:25</a>).

These wretched rulers dare to say, We are as safe in this city as flesh in a boiling pot; the walls of the city shall be to us as walls of brass, we shall receive no more damage from the besiegers than the caldron does from the fire. When sinners flatter themselves to their own ruin, it is time to tell them they shall have no peace if they go on. None shall remain in possession of the city but those who are buried in it. Those are least safe who are most secure. God is often pleased to single out some sinners for warning to others. Whether Pelatiah died at that time in Jerusalem, or when the fulfilment of the prophecy drew near, is uncertain. Like Ezekiel, we ought to be much affected with the sudden death of others, and we should still plead with the Lord to have mercy on those who remain.</body></html>
