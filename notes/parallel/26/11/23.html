It is considerably higher than the city, and commands a view over its entire extent. Here the Divine glory rested after taking its departure from the Temple and the city in the vision of the prophet. Here, in the vision of a later prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm" title="And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in the middle thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.">Zechariah 14:4</a>), the Lord is represented as standing in the day of final judgment. Here, not in vision, the incarnate Son of God proclaimed the second destruction of the obdurate city (Matthew 24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-20.htm" title="And when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is near.">Luke 21:20</a>); and from the same mountain He made His visible ascension into heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-50.htm" title="And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.">Luke 24:50-51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/1-11.htm" title="Which also said, You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven.">Acts 1:11-12</a>). The vision is now closed, and the prophet is transported in spirit back into Chaldaea, to declare what he had seen to his fellow-captives, and show them the vanity of their trust in the preservation of the guilty city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-25 Here is the departure of God's presence from the city and temple. It was from the Mount of Olives that the vision went up, typifying the ascension of Christ to heaven from that very mountain. Though the Lord will not forsake his people, yet he may be driven away from any part of his visible church by their sins, and woe will be upon them when He withdraws his presence, glory, and protection.</body></html>
