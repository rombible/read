Ewald, Havernick, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Currey restrict the designation "strangers" to unfaithful and unauthorized priests, who, as in the days of Israel's apostasy, notoriously under Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>), may, in the confluence of idolatries that took place in Jerusalem during the reigns of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2-4, 23-25</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-7, 11, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-2.htm">2 Chronicles 33:2-7</a>), have been admitted to participate in the temple services; but Kliefoth, Delitzsch, Keil, Smend, and Plumptre, with better judgment, recognize in the "strangers" foreigners who had not incorporated themselves with Israel by submitting to circumcision, but, though dwelling in the midst of Israel, were still uncircumcised heathen in both heart and flesh. With regard to these foreigners, the Law of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8, 10</a>) enacted that, by accepting circumcision, they might become members of the Israelitish commonwealth, but that without this they could not be permitted to partake of the Passover, the highest symbol of national and religious unity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48, 49</a>). Nevertheless, it was open to them, on giving a certain measure of obedience to the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16, 22</a>), to enter the sanctuary and present all sorts of offerings to Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-14.htm">Numbers 15:14, 29</a>) Hence Israel's offence had not been the admission of such "sons of the stranger" into the sanctuary, but the admission of them without insisting on the above specified conditions, in other words, the admission of such as not only lacked the bodily mark of circumcision - which would not have excluded them - but were destitute as well of the first elements of Hebrew piety, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were as uncircumcised in heart as they were in the flesh. The sanctioning of such within the temple courts, while Jehovah's bread, the fat and the blood, was being offered, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while sacrificial worship was being performed, was not simply a desecration of the "house," but was an express violation of the covenant Jehovah had made with Israel with reference to these very "sons of the stranger." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
