Ezekiel's supposed (Wellhausen, Smend) silence as regards the firstlings of cattle, which in the book of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>) and in the Deuteronomist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-19.htm">Deuteronomy 15:19</a>) are to be eaten by the offerer, but in the priest-code (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>) belong to the priests, is imaginary. The first of all the firstfruits of everything cannot surely mean of everything except cattle. If Ezekiel does not give the tenths of the tithes to the priests, he still assigns them to the sanctuary (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-14.htm">Ezekiel 45:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
