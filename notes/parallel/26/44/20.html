The prohibition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-21.htm" title="Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.">Ezekiel 44:21</a> is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm" title="Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:">Leviticus 10:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The next rubric concerned the mode in which the priests should wear their hair. It should neither be shaved nor worn long, thus avoiding excess on either side (compare for the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>; and for the second, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, Revised Version), but should merely be polled. The obligation to let the hair grow freely was imposed upon the Nazarite only during the period of his vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). The verb "to poll," or "cut" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>), occurs nowhere else. Smend thinks what is here denied to the priests collectively is in the priest-code denied solely to the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, Revised Version; compare, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>, Revised Version), and discovers in this a sign of the later origin of Leviticus. Ezekiel's raising the priesthood as a body to the rank of the high priest, of whom in connection with this temple is no trace, rather proves Ezekiel to have been later than Leviticus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
