he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. This gives another and a conclusive reason for regarding the sacrificial worship of Ezekiel 46 as symbolical.<p><span class= "bld">To eat bread before the Lord.--</span>This is the common scriptural expression for partaking of the sacrifices (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm" title="Then Jacob offered sacrifice on the mount, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm" title="And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.">Exodus 18:12</a>), and there is no reason for restricting it to the shew-bread and other unbloody offerings. The eating of the latter was an exclusively priestly prerogative, and the "prince" of Ezekiel, though greatly distinguished, is not in any way endued with priestly functions. He is to partake of his sacrificial meals within this highly-honoured gate, while the people eat in the outer court. There has been much discussion as to whether the prince was to go in and out by this gateway, or only, having entered by one of the others, to eat in this. The language here seems sufficiently plain, and if there could be any doubt, it would be removed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/46-1.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.">Ezekiel 46:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-8.htm" title="And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.">Ezekiel 46:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-10.htm" title="And the prince in the middle of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.">Ezekiel 46:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-12.htm" title="Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily to the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looks toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.">Ezekiel 46:12</a>. It appears there that the prince is always to enter and leave by this gate except "in the solemn feasts;" then he is to enter in the midst of the people, by either the north or the south gate, and go out by the opposite one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - It is <span class="cmt_word">for the prince</span> conveys an erroneous impression, as if the edict, excluding all from passing through the east outer gate, did not apply to the prince; but even for him the gate was not to serve as a mode of entrance into the temple, or, if so, only on exceptional occasions (see on Ezekiel 46:2), but merely as a place to sit in. The Revised Version accurately renders the words, <span class="accented">As for the prince</span>, <span class="accented">he shall sit therein as prince</span>, etc. That the "prince" here alluded to (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) could not have been the Prince David, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Messiah already spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>), but must have denoted the civic authorities of the new community of Israel, "the civil head of the theocracy," Havernick infers from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8, 9</a>, where the coming "prince" is contrasted with Israel's previous rulers who oppressed their subjects, from the absence of some such characteristic predicate as "shepherd" or "king," which would, he thinks, have been attached to the word "prince" had it been intended to designate Messiah, from the prince's offering for himself a sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>), from the allusion to his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16</a>), and from what is recorded about his behavior in worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a>); but none of these statements concerning the "prince' forbids his identification with Messiah, unless on the supposition that it was already understood Messiah should be a Divine-human Personage. This, however, had not then been so distinctly revealed as to be widely and accurately known. Hence it seems enough to say that while the "prince" would have his highest antitype in the Messiah, he would also have, though in a lower and lesser degree, an antitype in every righteous ruler (if ever there should be such) who might subsequently preside over Israel (see on Ezekiel 37:25). The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">to eat bread before the Lord,</span> while referring in the first instance to those sacrificial meals which, under the Law, commonly accompanied unbloody offerings, as the meat offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>), the showbread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>), and the unleavened leaves of the Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>), and could only be partaken of by the priests, in the second instance signified to partake of sacrificial meals in general, even of such as consisted of the portions of flesh which were eaten in connection with ordinary bloody offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>). If, after Kliefoth, the former be adopted as the import of the phrase here, then the thought will be that in the new cultus the prince should enjoy a privilege which under the old was not possessed even by the king; if, after Keil, the second view be preferred, the sense will amount to this, that under the regulations of the future the prince should have the favor accorded him "of holding his sacrificial meals in the gate," whereas the people should only be permitted to hold theirs "in the court," or "in the vicinity of the sacrificial kitchens." <span class="cmt_word">The way of the porch</span> is mentioned as the ingress and egress for the prince; which implies that he should obtain access to the outer court by either the north or the south gate, since the outer door of the east gate was shut. This renders it probable that Ezekiel was himself standing on the outside of the east gate (see on ver. 1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
