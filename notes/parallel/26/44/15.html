They are here described as those who continued faithful in the general apostasy, and it is probable that Ezekiel uses the term in this sense.

That Ezekiel derived the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">the priests</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Levites</span>, from Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 17:9; 18:1; 24:8; 27:9) may be granted without admitting that the Levites were all priests, or that the phrase had other import than that the priests were, as the Deuteronomist says, "sons of Levi" (Deuteronomy 21:5; 31:9). The priesthood, at its institution, having been entrusted to Aaron and his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9, 44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>), on Aaron's death the high priesthood passed into the hands of Eleazar, his eldest (living) son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-26.htm">Numbers 20:26-28</a>), and after Eleazar's death into those of Phinehas, his eldest son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11-13</a>). In the last days of the judges, when the ark and tabernacle stood at Shiloh, the high priesthood belonged to Eli, of the line of Ithamar (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a> and 1 Sam 22:20 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>), in which line it continued till the reign of David, when it was held conjointly by Abiathar (called also Ahimelech) of the line of Ithamar, and Zadok of the line of Eleazar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-4.htm">1 Kings 4:4</a>). This arrangement, however, Solomon eventually overturned, by deposing the former for espousing Adonijah's pretensions to the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and from that time forward till the exile the high priesthood remained with Zadok and his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). When, therefore, it is announced to Ezekiel that his vision-sanctuary should have as <span class="cmt_word">priests the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of Jehovah's sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from him</span>; the first question that arises is - To <span class="accented">what does this allude?</span> Kliefoth holds it cannot mean that, while Israel as a whole declined into idolatry, the Zadokite priests remained faithful to the worship of Jehovah, because the vision of Judah's idolatries granted to the prophet, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, revealed quite clearly that the priesthood was as much caught in the national apostasy as were the princes or the people. Nor is the language of the text perfectly satisfied by the view of Havernick, Keil, Delitzsch, and others, that it goes beck to Zadok's fidelity to the throne of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>), a fidelity exhibited also by Abiathar, or to his adherence to Solomon in preference to Adonijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8, 39</a>), this time without Abiathar's concurrence, rather in the face of his opposition. In neither of these instances was Zadok's fidelity specially directed towards Jehovah's sanctuary, but concerned expressly and exclusively David's throne. Hence the commendation of the Zadokites' fidelity can only signify that, while the priesthood as a body were corrupt like the people, there were among them, as among the people, some who, like Ezekiel, continued steadfast to Jehovah's sanctuary; that these faithful few were Zadokites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a>), and that to these should be entrusted the priesthood in the new sanctuary. But, at this point, a second question <span class="accented">starts - Was it intended to declare that the new priesthood should be Zadokites in body</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of lineal descent, or <span class="accented">only in soul</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of moral and religious excellence? The former is contended by Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, and others, who see in the vision-sanctuary a plan of the second, or post-exilic, temple, and in its ordinances a program for the establishment of the Levitical hierarchy; but this contention shatters itself on the fact that no proof exists either that the second temple was constructed after Ezekiel's as a model, or that those who served in it were exclusively flesh and blood Zadokites. The latter opinion, favored by Kliefoth, appears the more correct, that moral and spiritual resemblance to the sons of Zadok should form the first qualification for the priesthood in this ideal sanctuary of the future (see note at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
