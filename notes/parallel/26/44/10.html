According to the so-called priest-code, the Levites were Levi's descendants, who were chosen by Jehovah for service in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-9.htm">Numbers 16:9</a>), to minister to the priests when these sacrificed in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>), and in particular to keep the charge of the tabernacle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the house and all its vessels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>), as distinguished from the charge of the sanctuary and of the altar, which pertained to Aaron and his sons alone as priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-2.htm">Numbers 18:2-6, 23</a>). The Deuteronomic code, says Wellhausen ('Geschichte Israels,' pp. 121, etc.), was unacquainted with any such distinction between Levites and priests, who, it is alleged, composed one homogeneous body, the tribe of Levi, whose members were equally empowered to officiate at the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), the lower duties of the tabernacle having been performed by the aforesaid strangers, and the subordination of Levites to priests having first been suggested by Ezekiel (comp. Smend, 'Der Prophet Ezekiel,' p. 361, "<span class="accented">Der</span> <span class="accented">unterschied zwischen Priestern und Leviten ist hier im Enstehn begriffen"</span>), and first formally carried out alter the exile. This theory, however, cannot be admitted as made out in face of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a>, which (ver. 1) recognizes "the priests" and" the Levites" as constituting "the whole tribe of Levi," and (ver. 3, 6) distinguishes between "the priest" and "the Levite;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>, which associates with Zadok the priest, the Levites as carriers of the ark; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>, in which the same distinction between the two bodies is recognized; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> 1 and 2 Chronicles, <span class="accented">passim</span>, which attest the existence of priests and Levites as separate temple officials in pre-exilic times; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>, 62; Ezra 3:8, 10; 6:20, which show that the distinction, alleged to have been first made by Ezekiel, was well known to the first company of exiles who returned under Zerubbabel to Jerusalem, and was by them traced back to pre-exilic times (see Keil, on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschDeuteronomy 18:1; Curtiss's 'Levitical Priests,' pp. 22, etc.; Delitzsch, in Luthardt's 'Zeit-schrift fur kirchliche Wissensehaft,' pp. 286, etc., aud in Riehm's ' Handworterbuch des Biblischen Alterthums,' art. "Leviten;" Oehler, in Herzog's 'Real-Encyclopadie,' art. "Levi"). The question, therefore, of which Levites Ezekiel speaks in this verse, whether of those whose duties were of a menial order or of those whose functions partook of a priestly character, is not difficult to resolve. It could hardly have been the former, since in vers. 11-14 Ezekiel's Levites are represented as about to be degraded by being relegated to inferior tasks than those they had formerly performed; it must have been the latter, because in the present verse they are designated the <span class="cmt_word">Levites that are gone away</span> (or, <span class="accented">went</span>) <span class="cmt_word">far from me, when Israel went astray</span>. Now, Israel's apostasy from Jehovah and declension towards idolatry began with Solomon's unfaithfulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>), and continued with greater or less intensity in every subsequent reign till the exile; it certainly cannot be restricted, as Keil and Currey propose, to Jeroboam's conduct in setting up rival sanctuaries in Dan and Bethel, with altars and priests, for the accommodation of the northern kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-33</a>). Nor is there room for doubting, although historical notices of the fact are not abundant, that in this apostasy the priesthood largely led the way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>), becoming priests of the high places, ministering for the people at heathen altars, and so causing them to fall into iniquity (ver. 12). Hengstenberg and Plumptre suggest that the reason why these apostate priests are now called Levites was to intimate that they were no more worthy of the priesthood, and were about to be reduced to the lower ministry of the Levites so called. Consequently, under the new Torah, those among the priests (who were also Levites) who had been guilty of this flagrant wickedness (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, says Delitzsch, all the Aaronides who were not Zadokitos) would no more, either in themselves or their descendants, be suffered to retain the priestly office, but would be degraded to the status of ordinary Levites, and, like them, should be <span class="cmt_word">ministers</span> in Jehovah's <span class="cmt_word">sanctuary</span>, having <span class="cmt_word">charge</span> <span class="accented">- or</span>, <span class="accented">oversight</span> (Revised Version) - at the gates of the house, and ministering, to (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) the house, i.e. in its courts, serving as keepers of the charge of the house (ver. 14), as watchers at the gates of the house (ver. 11), as slaughterers of the sacrificial victims (ver. 11), but should not, like their brethren who had remained faithful, be allowed to do the office of a priest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> approach the altar to offer sacrifice, or to enter into the holy place (ver. 13). In this way they should bear <span class="cmt_word">their iniquity</span> (vers. 10,12) - a favorite expression in the middle books of the Pentateuch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-19.htm">Leviticus 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-31.htm">Numbers 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>), but never occurring in Deuteronomy, and meaning "to be requited" on account of, and make expiation for, sin and <span class="cmt_word">their shame and their abominations</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shame due to them for their abominations - a specially Ezekelian phrase (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Ezekiel 16:52, 54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-30.htm">Ezekiel 32:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-7.htm">Ezekiel 36:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
