No godless heathen should be allowed to enter in to profane the Divine worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-16.</span> - Accordingly, that no such abuses might creep in to desecrate the temple of the future, a new Torah was promulgated concerning the persons who should have a right to participate in its services. If the "prince" is omitted, the reason probably was that a special section is subsequently devoted to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-8</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- The ordinance for the people</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>No stranger</span> (or, <span class="accented">alien</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary.</span> The publication of this edict marked a clear advance upon preceding legislation. The old Torah conceded right of access to a foreigner, though uncircumcised, on certain conditions (ver. 7); this new Torah would accord such right of access to a foreigner on no conditions. Even should he be circumcised in the flesh, unless he possessed also that which the bodily mark symbolized, viz. circumcision of heart, he must remain without. Does not this look as if Ezekiel were posterior to the priest-code, rather than <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, as Wellhausen contends? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
