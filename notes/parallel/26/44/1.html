To this door the prophet was conducted back, by way of the inner north or south gate, from the inner court, in which he had received the measurements of the altar and the instructions for its consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>). Whether Ezekiel stood upon the outside of this door as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>, or upon its inside, cannot as yet be determined; but in either ease he observed that it was shut - again, whether on the east side towards the temple precincts, or on the west towards the outer court, is not mentioned, and cannot at this stage be decided. What led the seer to notice that the gate was closed was probably the circumstance that the last time he stood beside it it was open (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>), though proof cannot be given that he passed through it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>), conjoined with the fact that it formed the principal entrance to the temple, and as such had been described to him and measured (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
