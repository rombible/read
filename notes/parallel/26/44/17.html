That this was so is suggested by the statement that no wool, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, "perhaps so called from its being shorn off" (Gesenius), should <span class="cmt_word">come upon them whiles they ministered in the gates of the inner court</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">within</span> the court itself, or the house - the contrast being between what was of vegetable and what was of animal production. The reason for the prohibition of wool is hinted at in ver. 18 - it was apt to cause sweat, and thus entail impurity; the clean white linen, on the other hand, was designed both for hygienic reasons and as an emblem of purity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8, 14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
