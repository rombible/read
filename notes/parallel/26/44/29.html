That Ezekiel is silent about this, while the requirement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>, that the priest should obtain the breast with the right shoulder of every fire offering, goes beyond the prescription of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>, that the shoulder, two cheeks, and the maw should be the priest's portion, is regarded by Wellhausen and Smend as a proof that Ezekiel stands between Deuteronomy and the priest-code. But as Ezekiel does not condescend upon the particular parts which should be reserved from the fire offerings, it is impossible to say whether he held with the Deuteronomist or the writer of the priest-code, supposing them to be different; and, inasmuch as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> speaks of an offerings, by fire that was first paid to Jehovah and by him afterwards handed over to Aaron and his sons, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a> treats of the dues which should be paid by the people directly to the priests, it is clear that both practices may have existed together instead of the one (the former) coming in as an advance upon the other (the latter); see Keil on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschDeuteronomy 18:3. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-31 This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in ver. 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</body></html>
