and the thought is, when God shall forgive the sins of His people, and receive them to communion with Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest remember.</span> The words paint vividly the attitude of the penitent adulteress, humble, contrite, silent, ashamed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-3.htm">Hosea 3:3-5</a>), and yet with a sense that she is pardoned, and that the husband against whom she has sinned is at last pacified. Revised Version, <span class="accented">when I have forgiven thee.</span> The Hebrew verb so rendered is that which expresses the fullest idea of forgiveness, and which marked both the "day" and the "sacrifice" of atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-12.htm">Numbers 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). This, according to the received etymology, was represented in the mercy seat, the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, of the ark of the covenant (<span class="accented">cophereth</span>, as from <span class="accented">caphar</span>). So the prophet closes with the wet, Is of an eternal hope what had at first seemed to heal up to nothing but eternal condemnation. How far the prophet expected a literal fulfilment in the restoration of Sodom and Samaria, we cannot define with certainty; but the ideal picture of the purification of the waters of the Dead Sea in ch. 47:8 suggests that it entered into his vision of the future. For us, at least, it is enough to pass from the temporal to the eternal, from the historical to the spiritual, and to see in his words the noblest utterance of mercy prevailing over judgment - a <span class="accented">theodikea</span>, a "vindication of the ways of God to man," like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:59-63 After a full warning of judgments, mercy is remembered, mercy is reserved. These closing verses are a precious promise, in part fulfilled at the return of the penitent and reformed Jews out of Babylon, but to have fuller accomplishment in gospel times. The Divine mercy should be powerful to melt our hearts into godly sorrow for sin. Nor will God ever leave the sinner to perish, who is humbled for his sins, and comes to trust in His mercy and grace through Jesus Christ; but will keep him by his power, through faith unto salvation.</body></html>
