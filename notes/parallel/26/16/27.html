Philistia was but a small power in the south-west corner of Palestine, yet from the time of the Judges down through the whole period of the monarchy, they were the persistent foes of Israel. During the time immediately before Samuel, they held nearly the entire land in subjection, and although subdued by David, they became troublesome again in the times of the later kings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-7.htm" title="And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelled in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.">2Chronicles 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm" title="The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelled there.">2Chronicles 28:18</a>), and are often spoken of not only by the earlier prophets, Isaiah and Amos, but also by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm" title="And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,">Jeremiah 25:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.">Jeremiah 47:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm" title="Because of the day that comes to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remains: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.">Jeremiah 47:4</a>), Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/25-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;">Ezekiel 25:15-16</a>), and Zechariah <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-6.htm" title="And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.">Zechariah 9:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ashamed of thy lewd way.</span>--The Philistines, true to their own false gods, despised the Israelites for their unfaithfulness to Jehovah. It is the old but ever new story of the heathen repelled from the truth by the unworthiness of its professed followers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have diminished thine ordinary food</span>. The husband was bound to provide his wife with food and raiment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a>). Here his first discipline for the unfaithful wife is to place her on a short allowance. Jehovah, to interpret the parable, had placed Israel under the discipline of famine and other visitations that involved a loss of wealth and power. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-9.htm">Hosea 2:9, 10</a> supplies a striking parallel. <span class="cmt_word">The daughters of the Philistines.</span> So in ver. 57. The phrase, like "the daughter of Zion," indicates the Philistine cities. These had been, from the days of Samuel to those of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>), among the most persistent enemies of Judah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>). In the words, <span class="cmt_word">were ashamed of thy lewd way</span>, the prophet points, as his master had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>), to the fact that other nations had at least been faithful to their inherited religion, while Judah had forsaken hers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
