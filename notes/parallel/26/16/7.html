"I caused thee . . . thou didst increase and wax tall . . . and came to beauty<span class= "bld"> . . .</span> were fashioned<span class= "bld"> . . .</span> was grown." In the first clause, "caused thee to multiply," the literal sense takes the place of the figurative; but the rest of the verse describes Israel as a young woman just growing up into the beauty of early womanhood. The phrase "excellent ornaments" is somewhat difficult; but is now generally understood as meaning literally "ornament of cheeks," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>beauty. The <span class= "ital">whereas </span>in the last clause may give the impression of a contrast between the state described and the former one of infancy; this is not intended. But the meaning is, that while Israel was thus growing into the full development and beauty of womanhood, she was still "naked and bare."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The tenses should be in the simple historic past: <span class="cmt_word">I caused; thou didst increase and wax great; thou attainedst,</span> and so on (Revised Version). In the word "multiply" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>) the figure passes into historical reality. <span class="cmt_word">To excellent ornaments</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">to ornament of ornaments.</span> The word is commonly used of jewels, trinkets, and the like (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-4.htm">Exodus 33:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>). So Vulgate, <span class="accented">mundus muliebris.</span> Here, however, the external adorning comes in vers. 10, 11, and instead of the plural we have the dual. Hitzig is, perhaps, right in taking the phrase to refer to tide beauty of the cheeks, which are themselves the ornaments of the golden prime of wroth. The LXX., following either a different reading or paraphrasing, gives, "to cities of cities." The two clauses that fellow point to the most obvious signs of female puberty. For <span class="cmt_word">whereas,</span> read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">yet</span>, etc., as describing, not as the Authorized Version seems to do, a state which trod passed away, but one which still continued even when full-grown girlhood would have demanded clothing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
