At first the custom appears to have been a ceremony of passing young children through the fire to thereby consecrate them to Moloch; but afterwards it became an actual sacrifice of them in the fire to the idol. The Lord speaks of them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm" title="Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Is this of your prostitutions a small matter,">Ezekiel 16:20</a>, as "<span class= "ital">thy </span>children whom thou hast borne unto Me;" they were indeed Israel's children, but still children whom God had given to her.

The last clause of the verse would be better translated, <span class= "ital">Were thy whoredoms too little</span>?--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, was not apostacy enough without adding thereto this terrible and unnatural crime?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The next stage of idolatry is that of Moloch worship, which never wholly ceased as long as the monarchy of Judah lasted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>). It will be noticed that the words, "the fire," are in italics, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are not in the Hebrew, the verb "to pass through" having acquired so technical a meaning that it was enough without that addition. This, as the closing words indicate, was the crowning point. As though idolatry in itself was a small matter, it was intensified by infanticide. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
