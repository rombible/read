From the dress of the bride we pass to her luxuries in the way of food. The things named might, of course, be only chosen as the delicacies for which the land of Israel was famous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13, 14</a>), which in the prophet's own time were in demand in the markets of Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>). Cakes of flour and honey were in common use in various forms of Greek ritual, and are probably referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>, but in that of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>) honey takes its place, side by side with leaven, as a thing forbidden. <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst grow into a kingdom.</span> History crops out through the parable, and points to the stage which it has now reached, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that of the magnificence of the kingdom under Solomon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
