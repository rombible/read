Nevertheless they had done so, and in addition to their Egyptian idolatries, had gone to the extent, in the time of Ahaz, of displacing the altar in the court of the Temple, and putting in its stead an altar of the gods of Assyria (2 Kings 16.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With the Assyrians</span>. Here also the words include political alliances like that of Ahaz with Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>), as well as the adoption of idolatrous worship. The latter probably followed under Ahaz as a consequence of the former, and afterwards spread through the influence of the Assyrian colonists - each nation with its own deities - in Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>). The culture of the queen of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the Assyrian Ishtar, may have had this origin. <span class="cmt_word">Yet couldest not be satisfied.</span> One is reminded once more of Juvenal ('Sat.,' 6:130). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
