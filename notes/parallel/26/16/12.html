It is not by mere hyperbole that Israel is represented as worse than others. The grace which does not elevate always reacts by directing to a lower depth. (See Excursus at end of this Book on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-7.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;">Ezekiel 5:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A jewel on thy forehead;</span> better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">a ring upon thy nose.</span> The word has the same meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-47.htm">Genesis 24:47</a> ("earring" in the Authorized Version); <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-21.htm">Isaiah 3:21</a> (where the Authorized Version gives "nose jewels"); <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-22.htm">Proverbs 11:22</a>. Jerome, however, notes (<span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that the Syrian women of his time wore pendants or lockets that hung from the forehead to the nostrils. The crown, or diadem (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), the thin circlet of gold confining the hair, completed the catalogue of ornaments. The Chaldee Targum continues its spiritual interpretation: "I gave the ark of my covenant to be among you, and the cloud of my glory overshadowed you, and the angel of my presence led you in the way." And, if we assume, as we legitimately may assume, that Ezekiel, above all others, the prophet of symbolism, did not fill up his picture with details which were only meant to fill it up, this seems a not unfitting interpretation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
