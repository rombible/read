Sodom and Samaria might claim a verdict of acquittal ("justify," in its technical sense) as compared with Judah. They had not presented, as she had done, a confluence of all the worst idolatries. The words find something like an echo in our Lord's teaching <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-24.htm">Matthew 11:24</a>.

The Revised Version changes both meaning and punctuation: <span class="accented">Bear thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters</span>; <span class="accented">through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou</span>; but the Authorized Version seems preferable. It may be questioned whether the word for <span class="cmt_word">judged</span> is ever used of an acquittal. The point of the sentence is that Judah condemned those who were less guilty than herself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
