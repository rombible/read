yes, I said to you when you were in your blood, Live.">Ezekiel 16:6</a>, omit the <span class= "ital">when, </span>and render, "and I passed by thee." Two separate visits are spoken of: the one in Israel's infancy in Egypt, when God blessed and multiplied her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm" title="And when I passed by you, and saw you polluted in your own blood, I said to you when you were in your blood, Live; yes, I said to you when you were in your blood, Live.">Ezekiel 16:6</a>); the other when she had become a nation, and God entered into covenant with her in the Exodus and at Sinai. The verse describes this covenant in terms of the marriage relation, a figure very frequent in Scripture. On the phrase "spread my skirt," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-9.htm" title="And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.">Ruth 3:9</a>, and on "becamest mine," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-10.htm" title="Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.">Ruth 4:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The words point to the time of the love of the espousals of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>, interpreting the parable, when Israel had grown to the maturity of a nation's life, and gave promise, in spite of previous degradation, of capacities that would render it worthy of the love of the Divine Bridegroom. <span class="cmt_word">I spread my skirt over thee.</span> Garments were often used as coverlets, and the act described was therefore, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>, the received symbol of a completed marriage (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>). The historical fact represented by the symbol here was probably the formal covenant between Jehovah and Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6, 7</a>). It was then that he became her God, and that she became his people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
