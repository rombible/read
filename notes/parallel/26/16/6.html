He delivered them from their oppressors; He raised up a leader for them , He gave them a law and a Church, with its priesthood and its sacraments; He led them into the land of promise, delivered them from their enemies, and constituted them a nation under the most favourable circumstances for their growth and development in all righteousness. The sense is well expressed in our version; but the original does not contain the word <span class= "ital">when, </span>nor words corresponding to the words in italics. The connection shows that "in thy blood" is to be taken with "I said," and not with "live;" it was while Israel was in its unclean and neglected condition that the gracious word "live" was spoken. The Chaldee paraphrast has adopted the other connection, and ingeniously explained, "I revealed myself that I might redeem you, because I saw that you were afflicted in your bondage; and I said unto you, In the blood of circumcision I will pity you. and I said unto you, In the blood of the passover I will redeem you." The word <span class= "ital">polluted </span>is better rendered by the margin, <span class= "ital">trodden under foot, </span>referring to their oppressed condition in Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">polluted</span>, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">weltering</span>, the primary meaning of the verb being that of stamping or treading, and omit "when thou wast," as weakening the condensed force of the original. The marvel of that unlooked for pity is emphasized by the iteration of the word of mercy, <span class="cmt_word">Live</span>. The commentary of the Chaldee Targum is sufficiently curious to be quoted: "And the memory of my covenant with your fathers came into my mind, and I was revealed that I might redeem you, because it was manifest to me that ye were afflicted in your bondage, and I said unto you, 'I will have compassion on you in the blood of circumcision,' and I said unto you, 'I will redeem you by the blood of the Passover'" (Rosenmuller). The thought underlying this strange interpretation is that blood might be the means of life as well as of pollution, and in that thought there is a significance at once poetical and profound, almost, as it were, anticipating the later thoughts that the blood of Jesus cleanseth from all sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>), that we make our robes white in the blood of the Lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). There is no reason, however, for believing that such thoughts were present to the prophet's mind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
