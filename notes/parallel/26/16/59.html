Falling back upon the idea of the espousals of Israel in the covenant made at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42, 45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11, 12</a>), Ezekiel presses home on Judah the thought that she had broken that covenant. She must suffer as though it no longer existed. She must "dree her weird" and "accept her punishment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>). And then Jehovah would show that he had not really been unmindful of his part in it. He bad remained faithful in spite of her unfaithfulness. And so in the day of her repentance he will not only renew it, but will give it a higher and more permanent character. The "new covenant" of which Ezekiel's master had spoken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>) should not be as the old, decaying and vanishing away, but should be foreverlasting. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:59-63 After a full warning of judgments, mercy is remembered, mercy is reserved. These closing verses are a precious promise, in part fulfilled at the return of the penitent and reformed Jews out of Babylon, but to have fuller accomplishment in gospel times. The Divine mercy should be powerful to melt our hearts into godly sorrow for sin. Nor will God ever leave the sinner to perish, who is humbled for his sins, and comes to trust in His mercy and grace through Jesus Christ; but will keep him by his power, through faith unto salvation.</body></html>
