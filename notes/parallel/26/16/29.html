Thence it became extended over the whole land. It is thought by some writers to revert here to its original meaning, and be equivalent to the low, flat land. The expression will become clearer if translated, "the Canaan land Chaldaea." The word, however, bears also the meaning of traffic, commerce (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-8.htm" title="Who has taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?">Isaiah 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm" title="He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loves to oppress.">Hosea 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm" title="Howl, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.">Zephaniah 1:11</a>), and in this sense is applied to Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-4.htm" title="He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.">Ezekiel 17:4</a>, and this is the better meaning here. The idea will then be that Israel, beginning its idolatries in the actual Canaan, had extended them along with her commercial intercourse on every side, until at last she had carried them even to Chaldaea, the great commercial emporium of the time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Canaan,</span> etc. The words at first seem to give the nearest and furthest points of the intercourse of Israel with foreign nations. I incline, however, with Smend and the margin of the Revised Version, to take Canaan in its secondary sense as "the land of traffick," Chaldea being in apposition with it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>, for a like use of the Hebrew word). Chaldea thus comes in its right place as closing the list of the nations with whom the harlot city had been unfaithful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
