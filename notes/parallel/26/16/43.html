(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-24.htm" title="So he sent his brothers away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that you fall not out by the way.">Genesis 45:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-9.htm" title="If a wise man contends with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.">Proverbs 29:9</a>; and in this particular form, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/19-27.htm" title="But I know your stayed, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.">2Kings 19:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/37-28.htm" title="But I know your stayed, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.">Isaiah 37:28-29</a>, where the same word is used.)<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt not commit.--</span>The English here follows the Masoretic punctuation, putting the verb in the second person. Probably it should be read in the first person (which only changes the Masoretic vowels) and translated "that I may not commit wickedness concerning all thine abominations." The word for <span class= "ital">wickedness </span>is the especial word used for one who tolerates sin in another who is under his control (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-29.htm" title="Do not prostitute your daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness.">Leviticus 19:29</a>). God represents that it would be wrong to allow Israel's sin to go unpunished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast not remembered</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>). There is, so to speak, a certain dawn of tenderness in the new form of reproach, as compared with the sternness of what had gone before, and this in itself implies the pity which is the ground of hope. <span class="cmt_word">Fretted</span>. Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-12.htm">Ezra 5:12</a>) uses the same word, there rendered "provoke." Had Ezekiel's use of it stamped it as the right word for confession? <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not commit,</span> etc. The Vulgate follows a reading which gives, "I have not done according to thy lewdness," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the guilt had deserved a greater punishment. The Revised Version margin gives, "Hast then not committed," etc.? The word for "lewdness" ("lewd way" in ver. 27) is specially characteristic of Ezekiel, who uses it eleven times. Elsewhere it is translated "wickedness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), "lewdness" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-6.htm">Judges 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>. It conveys always the sense of a guilt that revolts and shocks us. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
