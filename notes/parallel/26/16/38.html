The Jewish method of capital punishment on individuals was by stoning (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.">Leviticus 20:2</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm" title="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?">John 8:5</a>), and of punishing an apostate city was by the sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-15.htm" title="You shall surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.">Deuteronomy 13:15</a>). Hence both modes are mentioned together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm" title="They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.">Ezekiel 16:40</a>, though somewhat at the expense of the consistency of the allegory. The last clause would be more exactly translated, "I will make thee blood of fury and jealousy," the fury referring to the avenging of murder, and the jealousy to the punishment of adultery, each requiring the life, or blood, of the offender.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - The <span class="cmt_word">bloodshed</span> may refer, as in ver. 36, to the Moloch sacrifices, or may include also other crimea, assassinations and judicial murders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>). Strictly speaking, the punishment of the adulteress was death by stoning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-21.htm">Deuteronomy 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm">John 8:5</a>). Did Ezekiel think of the stones cast against the city from the catapult engines of the Chahleans as a literal counterpart of that punishment? In the last clause read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy</span>; <span class="accented">sc.</span> the death which was inflicted by the indignation of Jehovah as the Husband against whom Judah had sinned. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
