The thing intended is a fine kind of leather prepared from the skin of some sea animal; but the critics differ as to the particular animal intended, whether the dolphin or the dugong. "Fine linen" was a luxury much valued by the ancients, while "silk" is a word used only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-13.htm" title="Thus were you decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; you did eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and you were exceeding beautiful, and you did prosper into a kingdom.">Ezekiel 16:13</a>, and its meaning is much questioned. By its etymology it is thought to express fineness of texture; and our translators have followed the rabbinical tradition in understanding it to mean silk.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Broidered work</span>; the "raiment of needlework" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>. The word meets us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a>, as among the imports of Tyre from Egypt. Curiously enough, the Hebrew verb (<span class="accented">rakam</span>) has passed through Arabic into tide languages of Western Europe, and we have the Italian <span class="accented">ricamare</span>, the Spanish <span class="accented">recamare</span>, the French <span class="accented">recamer</span>, for" embroidering." <span class="cmt_word">Badgers' skin.</span> Elsewhere in the Old Testament the word is found only in the Pentateuch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-5.htm">Exodus 28:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6, 8, 10</a>, e<span class="accented">t al.</span>). It has been commonly taken as meaning the skin of some animal - badger, dolphin, or porpoise, or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">seal</span>, which was used for sandals. All the older versions, however, take it as a word of colour, the LXX. giving <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("dark red"); Aquila, Symmachus, and Vulgate, <span class="accented">ianthino</span> ("violet"). Possibly the two meanings may coalesce, one giving the material, the other the tint which met the eye. <span class="cmt_word">Fine linen.</span> The byssus of Egyptian manufacture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-3.htm">Exodus 39:3</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Silk</span>. The Hebrew word (here and in ver. 13) does not occur elsewhere. The word so translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22</a> is that which we find here and elsewhere for "fine linen." Silk, in the strict sense of the term, had its birthplace in China, and there is no evidence that even the commerce of Tyre extended so far; but the context points to some fine texture of the lawn or muslin kind, like the Coan vestments of the Greeks. So the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, as though it were made of fine hair; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">subtilia.</span> It is significant that three out of the four articles specified are prominent (as the references show) in the description of the tabernacle and the priestly dress, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 39</a>. The dress of the bride symbolized the ritual and cultus of Judaism. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
