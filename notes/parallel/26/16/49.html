It is noticeable, however, that the distinct sin which is mentioned in this passage is the negative one too common in all ages, "neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 49, 50.</span> - It is noticeable that what we commonly speak of as the specific sin of the cities of the plain is not mentioned here. The prophet fixes on the point which made Sodom a luxurious and sensual city, the graver evil being just hinted at in the word <span class="cmt_word">abominations</span>, and as the outcome of the evil tendencies. So in like manner the special sin of Samaria, the worship of the calves, is not named, but taken for granted. (<span class="cmt_word">For fulness of bread</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12</a>.) Prosperity and luxury in her case, as in that of other wealthy cities, hardened the hearts of men against the poor and needy. There was probably a sufficient reason for the omission which has been pointed out. It was wiser to dwell on the sins which were common to the two cities rather than on the vice which, though it existed in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>), was probably not prevalent there. <span class="cmt_word">As I saw good</span>; better, <span class="accented">according to what I saw.</span> The word "good" is not in the Hebrew, and the words apparently refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
