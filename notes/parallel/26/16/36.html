Either gold or silver is the more common term for money, and the prophet appears to have here used brass contemptuously. In this verse the people's apostasies are briefly recapitulated, under the names of adultery and child murder, as the basis for what follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy filthiness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thy brass</span>; probably as alluding to the tribute referred to in the previous verses, "brass" being taken as used scornfully for money generally. Possibly, however, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>, the word stands for the symbol of shame and vileness (compare our brazen faced), and so justifies the rendering of the Authorized Version and Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">Thy nakedness</span> <span class="cmt_word">discovered</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> interpreting the parable, the intercourse of Judah with foreign nations had simply exposed the points that were moot open to attack (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-9.htm">Genesis 42:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the blood of thy children.</span> The words may refer specially to the Moloch sacrifices of ver. 21, but may also include the lavish waste of life as well as treasure which had been the consequence of the foreign alliances. The harlot city is indicated as being also a murderess. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</body></html>
