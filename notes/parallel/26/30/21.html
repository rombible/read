The metaphor was in itself one of the most familiar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>). What is characteristic in Ezekiel is the way in which he follows the figure, so to speak, into its surgical details. A man with a broken arm might be cured and fight again; but it was not to be so with Pharaoh. His arm was not to be bound with a roller (the equivalent of the modern process of putting it in "splints"). The Hebrew word for "roller" is not found elsewhere, and Ezekiel's use of it is one of the instances of his knowledge of surgery. The corresponding verb is used by him of the bandages or swaddling-clothes of infancy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:20-26 Egypt shall grow weaker and weaker. If lesser judgments do not prevail to humble and reform sinners, God will send greater. God justly breaks that power which is abused, either to put wrongs upon people, or to put cheats upon them. Babylon shall grow stronger. In vain do men endeavour to bind up the arm the Lord is pleased to break, and to strengthen those whom he will bring down. Those who disregard the discoveries of his truth and mercy, shall know his power and justice, in the punishment for their sins.</body></html>
