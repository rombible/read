The image is pressed yet further. A warrior whose sword-arm was broken might go on fighting with his left. Hophra might continue to struggle, though with diminished strength. Ezekiel's words shut out the hope of any such struggle. The left arm also should be broken as the right had been. The Chaldean king should wax stronger and stronger. The sword of Nebuchadnezzar should be as truly "the sword of Jehovah," as that of Gideon had been (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a>). Figuratively, he should stand before him groaning as a man wounded to the death. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-26.htm">Jeremiah 46:26</a>, we have allusions to an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, which was to end in his sitting on his throne in the stronghold of Tahapanes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:20-26 Egypt shall grow weaker and weaker. If lesser judgments do not prevail to humble and reform sinners, God will send greater. God justly breaks that power which is abused, either to put wrongs upon people, or to put cheats upon them. Babylon shall grow stronger. In vain do men endeavour to bind up the arm the Lord is pleased to break, and to strengthen those whom he will bring down. Those who disregard the discoveries of his truth and mercy, shall know his power and justice, in the punishment for their sins.</body></html>
