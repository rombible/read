Ethiopian soldiers served in great numbers in the Egyptian armies. Libya and Lydia are an unfortunate substitution for the original terms, Phut and Lud, which are preserved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm" title="They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness.">Ezekiel 27:10</a>, where see Note. They are there mentioned as furnishing mercenaries to the Tyrian army; and it is known historically that they supplied them to a still greater extent to the Egyptian army.<p><span class= "bld">All the mingled people, and Chub.--</span>There is the same expression, "mingled people," in reference to Egypt, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm" title="And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,">Jeremiah 25:20</a>. In the connection here it may be understood especially of the foreign mercenaries from various quarters in the Egyptian armies. Chub is a name entirely unknown. Various conjectures have been hazarded, and various changes in the text proposed, but none are supported by sufficient evidence. It evidently denotes some ally of Egypt, possibly Nubia.<p><span class= "bld">Men of the land that is in league.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">sons of the land of the covenant.</span> The ancient interpreters, St. Jerome and Theodoret, understood this expression of the Jews who had sought refuge from Nebuchadnezzar in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (Jeremiah 42, 43, 44), to whom Jeremiah had expressly prophesied that the sword and famine of which they were afraid should overtake them there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/42-16.htm" title="Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which you feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof you were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.">Jeremiah 42:16-18</a>). This interpretation is supported by the translation of the Septuagint, made in Egypt, "land of my covenant." The objection made to this view, that Palestine is never called "the land of the covenant," and that this must therefore signify some unknown country in alliance with Egypt at the time, seems rather specious than real. If it happens that this expression is never used of Palestine, yet that was unquestionably the land of the people of the covenant, and a particular expression may very well be used once without occurring again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Libya</span>. Here the Authorized Version gives (rightly enough, though inconsistently) the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Phut</span>, which is reproduced in the Revised Version. The <span class="accented">Lydians</span>, in like manner, stand for Lud; but we have to remember, as before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>), that they are the African, and not the Asiatic, people of that name. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> the two nations are named among the auxiliaries of Egypt. Possibly the similarity of name may have led to the term being used also for the Lydian and Ionian forces enlisted by Psam-metichus I. (Herod., 3:4); but there seems more reason for including these in the <span class="cmt_word">mingled people</span> that are next mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Chub</span>, or Cub (Revised Version), is found here only, and has consequently given occasion to many guesses Havernick connects it with the <span class="accented">Kufa</span>, a district of Media, often named in Egyptian monuments; Michaelis, with Kobe on the Ethiopian coast of the Indian Ocean; Maurer, with Cob, a city of Mauretania; Gesenius, Ewald, and Bunsen suggest the reading <span class="accented">Nub</span>, and identify it with Nubia; Keil and Smend adopt the form Lub, found in the Lubim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>. On the whole, there are no adequate data for the solution of the problem. <span class="cmt_word">The men of the land that is in league.</span> Here, again, we are in a region of many conjectures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Hitzig and Kliefoth (following Jerome and the LXX., which gives, "the land of my covenant") take it of Canaan, as being the land in covenant with Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hengstenberg, for the Sabeans, as being members of the Judaeo-Egyptian confederacy implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil, Ewald, and Smend, of a people among the allies of Egypt, unknown to us, but sufficiently designated by Ezekiel for his readers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-19 The prophecy of the destruction of Egypt is very full. Those who take their lot with God's enemies, shall be with them in punishment. The king of Babylon and his army shall be instruments of this destruction. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another. No place in the land of Egypt shall escape the fury of the Chaldeans. The Lord is known by the judgments he executes. Yet these are only present effects of the Divine displeasure, not worthy of our fear, compared with the wrath to come, from which Jesus delivers his people.</body></html>
