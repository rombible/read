Jerome, Havernick, Hitzig, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kliefoth, and others are in favor of the former view, chiefly on the ground that Ver. 3 speaks of the nearness of the coming judgment. That the day of the Lord should be "near" is, however, too vague and relative a term to be decisive. On the whole, the question must be left as one which we have no sufficient data for solving. The close parallelism with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29.htm">Ezekiel 29</a>. seems to me slightly in favor of the second view. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-19 The prophecy of the destruction of Egypt is very full. Those who take their lot with God's enemies, shall be with them in punishment. The king of Babylon and his army shall be instruments of this destruction. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another. No place in the land of Egypt shall escape the fury of the Chaldeans. The Lord is known by the judgments he executes. Yet these are only present effects of the Divine displeasure, not worthy of our fear, compared with the wrath to come, from which Jesus delivers his people.</body></html>
