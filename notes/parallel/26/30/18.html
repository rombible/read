Otherwise called Tahpanhes; the city Daphne, also a frontier town near Pelusium, strongly fortified. It may be especially mentioned, because the Jews who fled from Palestine through fear of Nebuchadnezzar had taken refuge there (Jeremiah 43, 44).<p><span class= "bld">The day shall be darkened.--</span>This is a common prophetic form of describing coming calamity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-3.htm" title="For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.">Ezekiel 30:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-8.htm" title="All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and set darkness on your land, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 32:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm" title="The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm" title="The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">The yokes of Egypt.--</span>Not the yokes placed upon Egypt, but the tyranny which she exercised over others. The fuller expression, "bands of a yoke," occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-27.htm" title="And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.">Ezekiel 34:27</a>, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-13.htm" title="I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.">Leviticus 26:13</a>, the latter in reference to the deliverance of Israel from the bondage of Egypt. It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/43-9.htm" title="Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick kiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;">Jeremiah 43:9-10</a> that there was a royal palace at Tahpanhes, and it was foretold by the prophet that Nebuchadnezzar should there set up his pavilion, and thence smite Egypt. It is correspondingly foretold here that the power of Egypt should there be broken, because this and the neighbouring Pelusium were the frontier fortresses and keys of the land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At Tehaphnehes</span>; the <span class="accented">Tabu-</span>panes of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-14.htm">Jeremiah 46:14</a>; (where it appears as having a royal palace); the <span class="accented">Taphnae</span> of the LXX.; the <span class="accented">Daphne</span> of Herod., 2:30. It was another frontier-fortress in the neighborhood of Pelusium, built by Psammetichus. It may, perhaps, be represented by the modern <span class="accented">Tel-ed-Defenne</span>, about twenty-seven miles southwest of Pelusium. <span class="cmt_word">The day shall be darkened</span>. The normal image for the departure of the sunshine of prosperity, as in Ver. 3 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-20.htm">Amos 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The yokes of Egypt</span>. Commonly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-27.htm">Ezekiel 34:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10, 12</a>, the phrase would imply the deliverance of Egypt from the yoke of oppression suffered at the hand of others. Here that sense is clearly inappropriate. The LXX. and Vulgate give "the scepters" of Egypt, which implies a different reading, and this is adopted in substance by Ewald and Smend, the latter preferring rendering it by "supports" or "props," the "red" being used as a "staff" rather than as a "scepter" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pomp of her strength</span>. The phrase meets us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28</a>, and includes what we speak of as the parade of power, here probably with a view to the foreign forces that garrisoned both Daphne and Pelusium. The <span class="cmt_word">daughters</span> may be literally <span class="accented">the women</span> of the city, who were to share the usual fate of their sex on the capture of a city; or as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-6.htm">Ezekiel 26:6, 8</a>; or probably as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-53.htm">Ezekiel 16:53, 55</a>, for the villages and towns dependent on the strong city. On the whole, looking to the mention of the "young men" in Ver. 17, the literal meaning seems preferable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-19 The prophecy of the destruction of Egypt is very full. Those who take their lot with God's enemies, shall be with them in punishment. The king of Babylon and his army shall be instruments of this destruction. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another. No place in the land of Egypt shall escape the fury of the Chaldeans. The Lord is known by the judgments he executes. Yet these are only present effects of the Divine displeasure, not worthy of our fear, compared with the wrath to come, from which Jesus delivers his people.</body></html>
