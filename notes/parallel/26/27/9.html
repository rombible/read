Gebal, the ancient Byblos, the modern Gebeil, and the Gu-ba-lu of the Assyrian inscriptions, was a famous Ph?nician town just north of Beir-t. Its site is still rich in ruins. Its people were famous builders, and according to the margin of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-18.htm" title="And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.">1Kings 5:18</a> (so also the Septuagint and Vulgate) were employed by Solomon on the work of the Temple. The representation is that the whole widely-dispersed Ph?nician race were tributary to the works of Tyre. At this point the figure of the ship gives place for a time to plain language, the better to set forth the military resources and power of this great city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ancients of Gebal</span>. The word is used in the sense of "elders" or "senators," the governing body. Gebal, for which the LXX. gives <span class="accented">Biblii</span>, is identified with the Greek Byblus. The name appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a> in connection, among other nations, with Tyre and Asshur, as allied with them against Israel; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a> as near Lebanon and Hermon; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a> (margin Revised Version) as among the stonemasons who worked with Hiram's builders. Byblus was situated on an eminence overlooking the river Adonis between Beirut and Tripoli. Its modern name, <span class="accented">Gebail</span>, retains the old Semitic form, and its ruins abound in marble and granite columns of Phoenician and Egyptian workmanship. The work of the <span class="cmt_word">caulkers</span> was to stop the chinks of the ship, and the men of Gebal appear to have been especially skilful in this. We note that the metaphor of the ship falls into the background in the latter clause of the verse, and does not appear again. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
