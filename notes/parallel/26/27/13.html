Tubal and Meshech are the classic <span class= "ital">Tibareni</span> and <span class= "ital">Moschi,</span> between the Black and Caspian Seas. They were famous for dealing in slaves and in brass, or rather copper, of which their mountains still contain abundant supplies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Javan</span> (father of Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim, and son of Japheth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2, 4</a>) stands generically for Greece, and probably represents Ionia. <span class="cmt_word">Tubal and Meshech</span> are sons of Japheth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, and are always grouped together, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>, where Meshech appears alone, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>, where Tubal is named, but not Meshech. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a> they are associated with Elam and Asshur (Assyria); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2, 3</a> and Ezekiel 39:1 with Gog. The two names probably represented the tribes on the southeast coast of the Black Sea. Here the chief traffic was in slaves, the Tyrian traders probably buying them in exchange for their manufactured goods, and selling them to the cities of Greece as well as Phoenicia. In Greek history the names appear as Tibaroni and Moschi (Herod., 3:94; Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 5:5. 2, <span class="accented">etal</span>.). In Joel 4:6 Tyriaus are represented as selling Israelites as slaves in Greek cities (Hebrew "sons of Javan"). Thrace and Scythia were at all times the chief countries from which Greece imported her slaves. <span class="cmt_word">Vessels of brass.</span> Here, as throughout the Old Testament, we should read "copper," the mixed metal which we know as "brass" not Being known to ancient metallurgy. Copper-mines were found near the Caucasus, and Euboea was also famous for them. The region was also noted for its iron. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
