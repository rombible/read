The word for "fairs" occurs only in this chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-14.htm" title="They of the house of Togarmah traded in your fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.">Ezekiel 27:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm" title="Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-19.htm" title="Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in your fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in your market.">Ezekiel 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-33.htm" title="When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many people; you did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:33</a>). In the last case it is translated <span class= "ital">wares,</span> as it should be throughout.

To avoid monotony, the prophet also constantly alternates in the use of synonymous words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tarahish</span>. The description of the city is followed by a <span class="accented">catalogue raisonnee</span> of the countries with which she traded. Here we are on more certain ground, there being a general consensus that Tarshish, the Greek Tartessus, indicates the coast of Spain, which was pre-eminent in the ancient world for the metals named (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>). The ships of Tarshish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>) were the larger merchant-vessels that were made for this distant traffic. Like all such names, it was probably used with considerable latitude, and it is worth noting that both the LXX. and the Vulgate give <span class="accented">Carthaginians</span>. Probably the chief Phoenician colonies in Spain, notably, of course, Carthago Nova, were offshoots from Carthage, in which, by the way, we trace the old Hebrew <span class="accented">Kirjath</span> (equivalent to "city"). <span class="cmt_word">Traded in thy fairs</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">traded for thy wares</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they bartered their mineral treasures for the goods brought by the Tyrian merchants. The same Hebrew word appears in Vers. 14, 16, 19, 22, 23, but is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, and may have been a technical word in Tyrian commerce. The LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">nundinae</span>, which seems to have suggested the Revised Version. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
