It was probably the same with the wine of Chalybon, so much prized in Persia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Damascus</span>. The chief expert of the great capital of Syria was the wine of Helbon. The name occurs only here in the Old Testament. The LXX. gives <span class="accented">Chel-ben</span>; the Vulgate, as if it described the quality of the wine, <span class="accented">vinum pingue</span>. It has been identified with Aleppo and with Chaly-ben, but both of these places are too remote from Damascus, and Mr. J. R. Porter ('Dict. Bible,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.) finds it in a place a few miles from Damascus, still bearing the name, and famous as producing the finest grapes in Syria. Strabo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15.htm">Ezekiel 15</a>. p. 735) names the wine of Chalybon as the favorite drink of the Persian kings, and Athenaeus (1:22) says the same of the wine of Damascus. The name appears in Egyptian monuments in conjunction with Kedes, as a Hittite city, and Brugsch ('Geogr. <span class="accented">AEgypt</span>.<span class="accented"></span>,' 2:45) agrees with Porter as to its position. <span class="cmt_word">White wool.</span> The adjective has been taken as a proper name (Smend) "wool of <span class="accented">Zachar</span>,' the region being identified with Nabatheaea, which was famous for its sheep. The LXX. gives "<span class="accented">wool</span> of <span class="accented">Miletus</span>," the city most famous in Greek commerce for its woollen fabrics. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
