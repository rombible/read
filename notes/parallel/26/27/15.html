Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.">Genesis 10:7</a>). The tribe was located in Arabia, probably upon the shores of the Persian Gulf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm" title="The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall you lodge, O you traveling companies of Dedanim.">Isaiah 21:13</a>). The Dedan of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm" title="Dedan was your merchant in precious clothes for chariots.">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, on the other hand, is a Semitic tribe, spoken of also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-13.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.">Ezekiel 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-8.htm" title="Flee you, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I will visit him.">Jeremiah 49:8</a>. The "many isles" of this Dedan were the islands in the Persian Gulf, on the Arabian coast, and they were "merchandise" in the sense of supplying material for the commerce of Tyre. "Brought thee for a present" might seem to imply tribute, but the original rather conveys the idea of return payment. "Horns of ivory" is, literally, <span class= "ital">horns of teeth;</span> the name "horn" being simply a commercial term derived from the shape of the elephant's tusk. "Ebony" is a word used only here. It was brought both from India and Ethiopia, the wood from the latter being preferred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Dedan</span>. The name occurs again in Ver. 20, and has already met us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-13.htm">Ezekiel 25:13</a> (where see note). Here the words probably refer to the <span class="cmt_word">many isles</span> of the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea. So the ships of Solomon and Hiram - ships of Tarshish (name used generically for merchant-vessels) - brought ivory among their other imports, starting from Ezion-Geber (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>). Ebony came from Ethiopia and India. Virgil, indeed, names the latter country as the only region which produced it ('Georg.,' 2:115). Ceylon is at present one of the chief sources of supply. The LXX. curiously enough gives <span class="accented">Rhodians</span>, the Hebrew letters for d and r being easily mistaken by copyists. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
