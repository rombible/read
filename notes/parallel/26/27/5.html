The word in the original is in the dual, with reference to its two sides. Senir was the Amorite name of Hermon, or Antilebanon, called by the Sido-nians Sirion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm" title="(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>). Ezekiel wished to use a foreign name, and the latter may at this time have become obsolete. The timber brought thence for the ship's planking, and called <span class= "ital">fir, </span>was the same with that furnished by Hiram to Solomon for the floor of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-15.htm" title="And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.">1Kings 6:15</a>), and may have been either "fir" (spruce?) or cypress. The Scripture names of trees are not always well identified. Both were esteemed among the ancients for ship-building, especially the cypress, on account of its lightness, durability, and freedom from the attacks of worms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fir trees of Senti</span>. The name appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a> as <span class="accented">Shenir</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a> it is spelt as here. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a> we learn that it was the Amorite name for Hermon, as Sirion was the Sidonian name. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a> Hiram King of Tyro appears as supplying Solomon with the fir and cedar timber mentioned here for the erection of his palace, the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>). The fir tree was more commonly used for ships, the cedar for houses (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:444). The Hebrew for "boards" is unique in its form as a plural with a dual form superadded to indicate that each plank had its counterpart on the other side of the ship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
