"Thy great ships were at once thy defence and the means of thy commerce," or "were thy caravans of the sea, &c."

The ships of Tarshish are used generically for merchant-ships. The catalogue of the commerce ends with Ver. 24, and the more poetic imagery reappears. It was, as centering in herself all that they brought to her that the merchant-city was <span class="cmt_word">very glorious in the midst of the waters.</span> For <span class="cmt_word">sing of thee</span>, read, <span class="accented">the ships of Tarshish were thy caravans</span> (Revised Version). The word has also the sense of "wall," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a>; and this, describing the ships as the "wooden wails" of Tyre, gives a tenable sense here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
