Persia, more anciently called Elam, was just now rising into prominence. Its soldiers were probably obtained by the Tyrians from their commerce in the Persian Gulf. Lud is not the one mentioned among the children of Shem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm" title="The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.">Genesis 10:22</a>), but the Ludim (Lydians) of Hamite family, descended from Mizraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-13.htm" title="And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,">Genesis 10:13</a>). Phut was also an African tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm" title="And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.">Genesis 10:6</a>).

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a> the Ludim appear as descendants of Mizraim, while Lud in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a> is joined with Elam and Asshur as among the sons of Shem. Its combination with "Phut" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Libya) here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> is in favor of its referring to an African nation (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Phut</span>. Both the LXX. and the Vulgate give <span class="accented">Libyans</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a> the name is joined with Cash and Mizraim. The Lubim (Libyans) are named as forming part of Shishak's army in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> as closely allied with the Egyptians. Ezekiel names Phut again as sharing in the fall of Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>), and as serving in the army of Gog (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). Mr. R. S. Peele is inclined to identify them with the Nubians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
