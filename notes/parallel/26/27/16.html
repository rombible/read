The Hebrew (<span class="accented">ramoth</span>) occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>. "Coral" is the traditional Jewish interpretation, but the LXX. transliterates, and the Vulgate gives secure. <span class="cmt_word">Agate</span> is found here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-12.htm">Isaiah 54:12</a>, and has been identified with the ruby or carbuncle. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-19.htm">Exodus 28:19</a> and Exodus 39:12 the English represents a different Hebrew word. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
