Haran, important in the story of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-4.htm" title="So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.">Genesis 12:4</a>), the Charrae of the Romans, was in north-western Mesopotamia, at the junction of two great caravan routes, the one along the Tigris, the other along the Euphrates. Canneh, a contraction for the Calneh of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>, was the most important commercial city on the former, and was later known as Ctesiphon. Eden was an unknown town on the Euphrates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?">2Kings 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?">Isaiah 37:12</a>), and is to be distinguished from the Syrian Eden.<p><span class= "bld">Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad.--</span>Sheba is still the same Sheba before mentioned; for Pliny (<span class= "ital">Hist. Nat.,</span> xii. 40) says that the Sab?ans brought their goods from the spice country to Carrhae, where they held markets, and went thence to Syria and Ph?nicia. They were, therefore, traders between Mesopotamia and Ph?nicia. Asshur is here not the country of Assyria, but the commercial city Sura (modern Essurieh), on the banks of the Euphrates, above Thapsacus. Chilmad is supposed to be the Charmande of Xenophon (<span class= "ital">Anab.,</span> i. 5, 10), "a great city beyond the Euphrates, in the neighbourhood of the desert." Others identify it with Kalwada, near Bagdad. It is mentioned only here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Haran and Canaeh</span>, etc. From Arabia we pass to Mesopotamia. Haran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>) stands for the Carrhae of the Romans, situated at the point where the old military and commercial roads bifurcated Cowards Babylon and the Delta of the Persian Gulf in the one direction, and Canaan in the other. It appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a> and Genesis 29:4 as the city of Nahor, in Mesopotamia (Aram-Naharaim, equivalent to "Syria of the two rivers"), or, more definitely, in Parian-Atom, which lies below Mount Masius, between the Khabour and the Euphrates. It is famous in Roman history for the defeat of Crassus by the Parthians. <span class="cmt_word">Caaneh</span>. The eastern of the two roads just mentioned ran on to Calneh (of which Cauneh is a variant), named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a> as one of the cities built by Nimrod. It is probably represented by the modern <span class="accented">Niffer</span>, about sixty miles southeast of Babylon. It is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a> in connection with Carehemish, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a> with Hamath the great, as conquered by the Assyrians. It has been conjecturally identified by the Targum and other ancient writers with Ctesiphon, but (?). <span class="cmt_word">Eden</span>; spelt differently in the Hebrew from the Eden of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>. It is probably identical with the Eden near Thelassar (<span class="accented">Td</span>. <span class="accented">Assar</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-12.htm">Isaiah 37:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12</a>, where, as here, it is connected with Haran as among the Assyrian conquests. Its site has not been determined, and it has been placed by some geographers in the hill-country above the Upper Mesopetamian plains; by others near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. The position of the Eden of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>, near Damascus, points to a Syrian town of the same name. <span class="cmt_word">The merchants of Sheba.</span> The recurrence of the name after the full mention of the people in Ver. 22 arises probably from the fact that they were the carriers in the commerce between the Mesopotamian cities just named and Tyre. <span class="cmt_word">Asshur</span>. The name may stand (Smend), as it commonly does, for Assyria as a country; but its juxtaposition with the names of cities has led some geographers (Movers, p. 252, in Keil) to identify with a city Sum (<span class="accented">Essurieh</span>) on the west bank of the Euphrates, above Thapsacus (the <span class="accented">Tiphsah</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>), and on the caravan-route which runs from Palmyra (the <span class="accented">Tadmor</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>) to Haran. <span class="cmt_word">Chilmad</span>. The name is not found elsewhere. The LXX. gives Charman, a town near the Euphrates, mentioned in Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 1:5. 10, as Charmaude. It can scarcely have been a place of much general note, but may have had some special reputation which made it prominent in Tyrian commerce. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
