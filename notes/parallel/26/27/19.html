Besides this structural difficulty, there seems no appropriateness in the name Dan, a tribe of Israel long since carried into captivity. The city Dan was of quite too little prominence to be mentioned here. It is probable, therefore, that what our translators have taken for the conjunction is really a part of the name Vedan, a place in Arabia not elsewhere mentioned, but which some suppose to be Aden. Javan does not here stand for Greece, but for an Arabian place or tribe, which there is reason to think is Yemen.<p><span class= "bld">Going to</span> <span class= "bld">and fro.--</span>The margin is better, <span class= "ital">Menzal,</span> or rather--the first letter being a preposition--<span class= "ital">front Uzal,</span> the ancient Sanaa, afterwards the capital of Yemen. Yemen was famous for its sword-blades, which may be meant by the bright (literally, <span class= "ital">wrought</span>) iron, and also for its spices brought from India.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dan also</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">Vedan</span>. The Authorized Version, following the Vulgate, takes the first syllable as the common conjunction "and;" but no other verse in the chapter begins in this way, and the Revised Version is probably right in giving the Hebrew word as its stands. Dan, it may be added, was hardly likely to have been singled out of all the tribes after the mention of Judah and Israel, especially as it had shared in the exile of the ten tribes. Smend identifies it with <span class="accented">Waddan</span>, between Mecca and Medina, or with Aden. Javan, too. already named in Ver. 13, can scarcely here be Greece, though it may possibly refer to Greek traders. It also has been identified conjecturally with an Arabian city. The words<span class="cmt_word">, going to and fro</span>, have been rendered "from Uzal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-27.htm">Genesis 10:27</a>), the ancient name of the capital of Yemen, in Arabia; or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">with yarn</span>. The <span class="cmt_word">bright iron</span> describes the steel used for sword-blades, for which Yemen was famous. <span class="cmt_word">Cassia</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>) <span class="cmt_word">and calamus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-14.htm">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>) both belong to the class of perfumes for which Arabia was famous. It is probably the <span class="accented">Acorns fragraas</span>, the "sweet cane" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</body></html>
