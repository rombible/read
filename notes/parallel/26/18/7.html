The garment which the debtor had pledged as a security was to be restored to him at night. Such a law implied, of course, the return of the pledge in the morning. It was probably often used by the debtor for his own fraudulent advantage, and it was a natural consequence that the creditor should be tempted to evade compliance with it. The excellence of the man whom Ezekiel describes was that he resisted the temptation. Hath spoiled none by violence. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-1.htm">Leviticus 6:1-5</a>, which Ezekiel probably had specially in view. The sin, common enough at all times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>), would seem to have been specially characteristic of the time in which Ezekiel lived, from the king downwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>). As contrasted with the sin, there was the virtue of generous almsgiving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5-7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-20 The soul that sinneth it shall die. As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.</body></html>
