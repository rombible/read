These particulars have reference, first, to religious duties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm" title="And has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a menstruous woman,">Ezekiel 18:6</a> a), then to moral obligations, such as the avoidance of adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm" title="And has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a menstruous woman,">Ezekiel 18:6</a> b), and finally to duties negative and positive towards one's neighbour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-7.htm" title="And has not oppressed any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has spoiled none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;">Ezekiel 18:7-8</a>). The whole, including <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-5.htm" title="But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,">Ezekiel 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-9.htm" title="Has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 18:9</a>, may be considered as a terse summary of the practical duty of man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> - The verses that follow are noticeable as forming one of the most complete pictures of a righteous life presented in the Old Testament. It ads characteristic of Ezekiel that he starts from the avoidance of sins against the first table of the commandments. <span class="cmt_word">To eat upon the mountains</span> was to take part in the sacrificial feasts on the places, of which he had already spoken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a>; comp. 22:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>). The words, <span class="cmt_word">lifted up his eyes,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>, implied every form of idolatrous adoration. The two sins that follow seem to us, as compared with each other, to stand on a very different footing. To Ezekiel, however, they both appeared as <span class="accented">mala prohibita</span>, to each of which the Law assigned the punishment of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>), each involving the dominance of animal passions, in the one case, over the sacred rights of others; in the other, over a law of self-restraint which rested partly on physical grounds, the act condemned frustrating the final cause of the union of the sexes; partly, also, on its ethical significance. The prominence given to it implies that the sin was common, and that it brought with it an infinite degradation of the holiest ties. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-20 The soul that sinneth it shall die. As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.</body></html>
