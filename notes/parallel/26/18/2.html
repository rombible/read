"Concerning the land" should rather be <span class= "ital">in the land, i.e., </span>among the people, including both those at Jerusalem and in captivity. The teaching of this chapter concerning individual responsibility is, in one form or another, often repeated by Ezekiel. It is set forth in regard to the prophet and people, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/3-18.htm" title="When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.">Ezekiel 3:18-21</a>; in regard to those upon whom the mark was set, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/9-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 9:4-6</a>; in regard to those who enquire of the Lord, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/14-3.htm" title="Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?">Ezekiel 14:3-9</a>; and generally the teaching of this chapter is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/33-1.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 33:1-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-20 The soul that sinneth it shall die. As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.</body></html>
