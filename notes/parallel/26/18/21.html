This has necessarily two sub-divisions: (1) that of the wicked repenting and doing righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-21.htm" title="But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.">Ezekiel 18:21-23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-27.htm" title="Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.">Ezekiel 18:27-28</a>), and (2) that of the righteous falling into wickedness, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-24.htm" title="But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die.">Ezekiel 18:24-26</a>), which latter case is more briefly treated, because the object is to encourage hope in repentance. This case, in both its parts, is first treated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-21.htm" title="But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.">Ezekiel 18:21-24</a>, and then, for the sake of emphasis, repeated in reverse order in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-26.htm" title="When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in them; for his iniquity that he has done shall he die.">Ezekiel 18:26-28</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if the wicked will turn, etc.</span> Here, however, there is a distinct advance. The question is carried further into the relations between the past and the present of the same man, between his old and his new self. And in answering that question also Ezekiel becomes the preacher of a gospel. The judgment of God deals with each man according to his present state, not his past. Repentance and conversion and obedience shall cancel, as it were, the very memory of his former sins (Ezekiel's language is necessarily that of a hold anthropopathy), and his transgressions shall not be mentioned unto him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-16.htm">Ezekiel 33:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-9.htm">Isaiah 64:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>). Assuming the later date of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>, the last three utterances have the interest of being those of nearly contemporary prophets to whom the same truth had been revealed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:21-29 The wicked man would be saved, if he turned from his evil ways. The true penitent is a true believer. None of his former transgressions shall be mentioned unto him, but in the righteousness which he has done, as the fruit of faith and the effect of conversion, he shall surely live. The question is not whether the truly righteous ever become apostates. It is certain that many who for a time were thought to be righteous, do so, while ver. 26,27 speaks the fulness of pardoning mercy: when sin is forgiven, it is blotted out, it is remembered no more. In their righteousness they shall live; not for their righteousness, as if that were an atonement for their sins, but in their righteousness, which is one of the blessings purchased by the Mediator. What encouragement a repenting, returning sinner has to hope for pardon and life according to this promise! In verse 28 is the beginning and progress of repentance. True believers watch and pray, and continue to the end, and they are saved. In all our disputes with God, he is in the right, and we are in the wrong.</body></html>
