Since all alike belong to God and are absolutely in His power. He has no occasion to punish one lest another should escape; and again, since all are His, He loves and would save them all, and inflicts punishment only when it is deserved and His grace is rejected. Four cases are now discussed separately: (1) That of the righteous man who honestly seeks to follow the ways of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-5.htm" title="But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,">Ezekiel 18:5-9</a>); (2) that of his wicked son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-10.htm" title="If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does the like to any one of these things,">Ezekiel 18:10-13</a>); (3) that of the righteous son of the wicked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-14.htm" title="Now, see, if he beget a son, that sees all his father's sins which he has done, and considers, and does not such like,">Ezekiel 18:14-20</a>); (4) that of a change of character in the individual, whether from sin to righteousness or the reverse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-21.htm" title="But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.">Ezekiel 18:21-29</a>). The word "soul" throughout the chapter does not mean exclusively the immortal part of our nature, but, as so often in Scripture, is equivalent to <span class= "ital">man, </span>or <span class= "ital">person, </span>or <span class= "ital">self; </span>and the word "die" is used, as often elsewhere, in the broad sense of <span class= "ital">suffer punishment.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, all souls are mine</span>, etc. The words imply, not only creation, ownership, absolute authority, on the part of God, but, as even Calvin could recognize (<span class="accented">in loc.</span>), "a paternal affection towards the whole human race which he created and formed." Ezekiel anticipates here, and yet more fully in ver. 32. the teaching of St. Paul, that "God willeth that all men should be saved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</span> The sentence, though taken from the Law, which ordered capital punishment for the offences named, cannot be limited to that punishment. "Death" and "life" are both used in their highest and widest meaning - "life" as including all that makes it worth living, "death" for the loss of that only true life which is found in knowing God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-20 The soul that sinneth it shall die. As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.</body></html>
