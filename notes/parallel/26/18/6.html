The particular of eating upon the mountains is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-9.htm" title="Has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 18:9</a>, and refers to the feasts in connection with sacrifices to idols which were commonly held in high places. The Lord Himself, indeed, was also worshipped in high places, in express violation of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/12-17.htm" title="You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of your hand:">Deuteronomy 12:17-18</a>), but the connection here points to the sacrificial idol-feasts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm" title="And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.">Exodus 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.">1Corinthians 10:7</a>). The lifting up of the eyes to the idols is probably meant to express any longing after them short of actual worship (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-26.htm" title="But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.">Genesis 19:26</a>). The other sins mentioned in this verse were expressly forbidden in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-14.htm" title="You shall not commit adultery.">Exodus 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-19.htm" title="Also you shall not approach to a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.">Leviticus 18:19</a>), and were to be punished either with death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm" title="If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>) or with excommunication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-18.htm" title="And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he has discovered her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.">Leviticus 20:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-20 The soul that sinneth it shall die. As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.</body></html>
