Here, as before, there is no question of human sufficiency; and when the counsel is given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm" title="Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby you have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, O house of Israel?">Ezekiel 18:31</a>), "Make you a new heart and a new spirit," it is not meant to say that this can ever be the work of any other than God's Holy Spirit; but that Spirit is ever given to them that ask Him, and the question of salvation is still one which each man must decide for himself before God. The whole point of the chapter is that God's dealing with man is determined by man's own attitude towards Him. He that is alienated in his heart from God, whatever may have been his previous life, God will judge; and he that now seeks to conform his life to God's will, God will receive and forgive.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - That work was to produce repentance, hope, and fear. The goodness and severity of God alike led up to that. For a man to remain in his sin will be fatal, but it is not the will of God that he should so remain. What he needs is the <span class="cmt_word">new heart</span> and the <span class="cmt_word">new spirit</span>, which are primarily, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, God's gift to men, but which men must make their own by seeking and receiving them. <span class="cmt_word">So iniquity shall not be your ruin</span>; better, with the margin of the Revised Version, <span class="accented">so shall they not be a stumbling block</span> (same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-20.htm">Ezekiel 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>) <span class="accented">of iniquity unto you.</span> Repented sins shall be no more an occasion of offence. Men may rise on them to "higher things," as on "steppingstones of their dead selves." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:30-32 The Lord will judge each of the Israelites according to his ways. On this is grounded an exhortation to repent, and to make them a new heart and a new spirit. God does not command what cannot be done, but admonishes us to do what is in our power, and to pray for what is not. Ordinances and means are appointed, directions and promises are given, that those who desire this change may seek it from God.</body></html>
