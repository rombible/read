Their riches will be utterly unavailing. The expression in the original is even stronger: their gold shall be to them "an unclean thing," "filth," because they shall perceive that it has been to them an occasion of sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall cast their silver,</span> etc. The words remind us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a> and Isaiah 30:22, with the difference that here it is the silver and gold as such, and not the idols made of them, that are to be flung away. They had made the actual metal their idol, and their confidence in it should be powerless to deliver them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their gold shall be removed;</span> better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">as an unclean thing.</span> The word implies the kind of impurity of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>.

It is characteristic that he applies to riches as such the very same epithet, <span class="cmt_word">stumbling block of their iniquity,</span> as he had applied before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-20.htm">Ezekiel 3:20</a>) to actual idolatry (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:16-22 Sooner or later, sin will cause sorrow; and those who will not repent of their sin, may justly be left to pine away in it. There are many whose wealth is their snare and ruin; and the gaining the world is the losing of their souls. Riches profit not in the day of wrath. The wealth of this world has not that in it which will answer the desires of the soul, or be any satisfaction to it in a day of distress. God's temple shall stand them in no stead. Those are unworthy to be honoured with the form of godliness, who will not be governed by its power.</body></html>
