Both passages are the warnings, long ages ago, of the judgments now declared to be close at hand. "<span class= "ital">Their </span>holy places;" no longer God's, since He has abandoned them for the sin of the people. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.">Ezekiel 11:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The worst of the heathen;</span> literally, <span class="accented">evil ones of the nations</span> - with the superlative implied rather than expressed.

The Chaldeans were probably most prominent in the prophet's thoughts, but ch. 35:5 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a> suggest that there was a side glance at the Edomites. <span class="cmt_word">The pomp of the strong</span>, etc. Another echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>. (ver. 31). The "pomp" is that of Judah trusting in her strength. The "holy places" find their chief representative in the temple, but, as the word is used also of a non-Jehovistic worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-18.htm">Ezekiel 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>), may include whatever the people looked on as sanctuaries - the "high places" and the like. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">possidebuut sanctuaria</span>; the Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">they that sanctify them</span>; but the Authorized Version is probably right in both cases. Luther renders <span class="accented">ihre kirchen</span>, which reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-37.htm">Acts 19:37</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:23-27 Whoever break the bands of God's law, will find themselves bound and held by the chains of his judgments.

May the Lord enable us to seek that good part which shall not be taken away.</body></html>
