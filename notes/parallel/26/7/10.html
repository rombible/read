"The rod" is commonly understood of the Chaldaean conqueror; but as the word is the same for <span class= "ital">rod </span>and for <span class= "ital">tribe, </span>and is very often used in the latter sense, it will be more in accordance with the connection to understand here a play upon the word. There will be then an allusion to the rods of the tribes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.">Numbers 17:8</a>. There the rod of Aaron was made to bud and blossom by Divine power in evidence of his having been chosen of God; here the rod representing the tribe at Jerusalem in its self-will and pride has budded and blossomed to its destruction. So the description continues in the next verse, "Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness." Not a rod for the punishment of wickedness; but into a wicked people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is come</span>. Read, as before, <span class="accented">it cometh</span>; and for <span class="cmt_word">morning</span>, doom (see note on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">The rod hath blossomed</span>, etc. The three verbs imply a climax. The "doom" springs out of the earth; the rod of vengeance blossoms (the word is the same as that which describes the blooming of Aaron's rod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>), and the phrase was probably suggested by the history); <span class="cmt_word">pride</span> (either that of the Chaldean ministers of vengeance, or of Israel as working out its own punishment; I incline to the latter) buds and bears fruit. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a> the word follows on "blossom," and therefore seems applicable to the formation of the fruit rather than the flower. (For the image of the rod, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.</body></html>
