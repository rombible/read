"None of them; none of their multitude; none of their wealth." <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall there be wailing for them.</span> The noun is not found elsewhere. Taken, as the Authorized Version takes it, the thought, like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>, is that the usual rites of burial would be neglected, and that there would be "no widows to make lamentation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a>). The Revised Version "eminency" implies the loss of all that constituted greatness. Cornill and the LXX. ("beauty" or "gaiety") practically agree with this. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">requies</span>, and Furst "a gathering, or tumult of the people." Probably the text is corrupt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.</body></html>
