(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm" title="And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>.) The origin of the expression is to be sought, not in any supposed popular belief that the earth was square, but in the fact that so many common things had just four sides or four corners (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-12.htm" title="And you shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.">Exodus 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-2.htm" title="And you shall make the horns of it on the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and you shall overlay it with brass.">Exodus 27:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm" title="And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-11.htm" title="And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending on him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:">Acts 10:11</a>, &c), that the phrase came naturally to be a common expression of universality. "An end, the end," is a repetition for the sake of emphasis. It occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-6.htm" title="An end is come, the end is come: it watches for you; behold, it is come.">Ezekiel 7:6</a>, and, in varied words, also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-10.htm" title="Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.">Ezekiel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-12.htm" title="The time is come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is on all the multitude thereof.">Ezekiel 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm" title="Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.">Ezekiel 7:26</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/7-3.htm" title="Now is the end come on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense on you all your abominations.">Ezekiel 7:3-4</a> are repeated almost exactly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/7-8.htm" title="Now will I shortly pour out my fury on you, and accomplish my anger on you: and I will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense you for all your abominations.">Ezekiel 7:8-9</a>. The frequent repetitions of this chapter are designed, and give great force to the denunciation of woe. "Thine abominations are in the midst of thee," in the sense of calling down punishment upon them, as appears from the parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-9.htm" title="And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense you according to your ways and your abominations that are in the middle of you; and you shall know that I am the LORD that smites.">Ezekiel 7:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An end,</span> etc. The iteration of the word once more gives emphasis. The words read like an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a>. The <span class="cmt_word">four corners</span> (Hebrew, "wings") were probably, as with us, the north, east, south, and west. The phrase had been used before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>, and the thought meets us again, in the form of the "four winds," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-27.htm">Mark 13:27</a>. The "end" in this case is either that of the siege of Jerusalem, or that of the existence of Israel as a nation. It was now drawing nigh - was, as we say, within measurable distance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.</body></html>
