In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a> we have parallel instances of the advantage taken by the rich of the distress of the old tree holders. In the story of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-16</a> we have, though from a very different point of view, the history of a like purchase, while the city was actually surrounded by the Chaldeans. The neglect of the sabbatic year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8-17</a>) makes it probable that the jubilee year also (if, indeed, it had ever been more than an ideal) had fallen into desuetude, and that the buyers comforted themselves with the thought that the land they had got, on cheap terms, weald belong to them and their children forever. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.</body></html>
