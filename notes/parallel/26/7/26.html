The three chief sources of counsel, the prophets, the priests, and the elders, are all represented as applied to in vain. God had forsaken the people who had rejected Him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm" title="Then shall they call on me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:">Proverbs 1:28</a>, and the story of Saul's despair at his abandonment by God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm" title="And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.">1Samuel 28:15</a>.) In the following verse the trouble is described as affecting all classes alike, the king, the prince, and the people of the land, and, further, as being the fitting consequence and retribution of their own chosen way.<p>Here closes the first series of Ezekiel's prophecies, extending from the beginning of the fourth to the end of the seventh chapter. They were all uttered within the period of a year and two months. Like the following series (Ezekiel 8-19), they begin with a remarkable series of symbolic acts, or rather of descriptions of such acts, and are continued by plain prophecies. Ezekiel and his fellow-captives had now been between five and six years in exile, and they still looked to Jerusalem and the Temple as their pride and the strength of their nation, and doubtless many of them hoped to be able to return there to lead again their former lives. There could be no hope of affecting a thorough and lasting reformation among the people except by utterly dashing these hopes to the ground, and showing that the people must be led to repentance through a thorough humiliation and heavy punishment. Such is the purpose of these prophecies, and it is carried out with extraordinary vigour and power of language.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mischief... turnout.</span> The combination reminds us of the "wars and rumours of wars" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>. The floating uncertain reports of a time of invasion aggravate the actual misery (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-7.htm">Isaiah 37:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-46.htm">Jeremiah 51:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall seek a vision of the prophet,</span> etc. The words paint a picture of political chaos and confusion. The people turn in their distress to the three representativtes of wisdom - the prophet as the bearer of an immediate message from Jehovah, the priest as the interpreter of his Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>), the "ancients" or "elders" as those who had learnt the lessons of experience, - and all alike in vain.

May the Lord enable us to seek that good part which shall not be taken away.</body></html>
