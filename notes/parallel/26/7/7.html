Instead of this shall be the tumult (rather the trouble) of the day of war. (See the opposite contrast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-17.htm" title="And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.">Exodus 32:17-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The morning is come unto thee,</span> etc. In the only other passage in which the Hebrew noun occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>), it is translated "diadem," the meaning being strictly a circular ornament. Here the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span>, something twirled, out of which may come the meaning of the changes of fortune. Possibly, as in the familiar "wheel of fortune," that thought was involved in the circular form by itself. In the Tahnud it appears as the name of the goddess of fate at Ascalon (Furst). On the whole, I follow the Revised Version, Keil, and Ewald, in giving "thy doom." The "morning" of the Authorized Version probably rises from the thought that the dawn is, as it were, the glory and diadem of the day. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">contritio. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The day of trouble</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">of tumult.</span> The word is specially used of the noise of war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-3.htm">Zechariah 14:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not the sounding again upon the mountains.</span> The first noun is not found in the Old Testament, but a closely allied form appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>, for the song of the vintage. Not that, the prophet says, shall be heard on the mountains, but in its place the cry of battle and the noise of war. The LXX. "not with travail-pangs," and the Vulgate <span class="accented">non gloriae montium</span>, show that the word was in both cases a puzzle to the translators. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.</body></html>
