The action of Zedekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a> and Jeremiah 34:8 makes it probable enough that it was actually reproduced. A solemn litany procession like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13, 14</a> and Joel 2:15-17 would have been quite in keeping with his character. <span class="cmt_word">The prince shall clothe himself,</span> etc. The noun is specially characteristic of Ezekiel, who uses it thirty-four times. In ch. 12:12 the "prince" seems identified with the "king." Here it may mean either the heir to the throne, or the chief ruler under the king. <span class="cmt_word">The people of the land,</span> etc. The phrase is perhaps used, as the Jewish rabbis afterwards used it, with a certain touch of scorn, for the labouring class. All the upper class had been carried away captive with Jehoiachin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>). Compare Ezekiel's use of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-3.htm">Ezekiel 46:3, 9</a>. I will do unto them, etc. The chapter, or rather the whole section from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a> onwards, ends with an iterated assertion of the equity of the Divine judgments. Then also they shall know that I am the Lord, Almighty and all-righteous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:23-27 Whoever break the bands of God's law, will find themselves bound and held by the chains of his judgments. Since they encouraged one another to sin, God would dishearten them. All must needs be in trouble, when God comes to judge them according to their deserts. May the Lord enable us to seek that good part which shall not be taken away.</body></html>
