Among the Israelites the most important buying and selling was that of land, and it was provided in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-14.htm" title="And if you sell ought to your neighbor, or buy ought of your neighbor's hand, you shall not oppress one another:">Leviticus 25:14-16</a>) that this should in no case extend beyond the year of jubilee, when all land must revert to its possessor by inheritance. The seller in that year should return to his possession. Now it is foretold that the desolation shall continue so long that, even if the seller lived, he should be unable to avail himself of the jubilee year. "It is a natural thing to rejoice in the purchase of property, and to mourn over its sale, but when slavery and captivity stare you in the face, rejoicing and mourning are equally absurd" (S. Jerome). The idea of the latter part of the verse is, that no one shall grow strong since his life is passed in iniquity.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the seller shall not return,</span> etc. At first the thought seems only to add to the sorrow of the seller. He is told that he, at least, shall not return to his old estate. Even though they should be alive at the year of jubilee, their exile had to last its appointed time, Ezekiel's forty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a>) and Jeremiah's seventy years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). This, however, did not exclude the return of their children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>), and in the mean time all private sorrow would fall into the background as compared with the great public woe of the destruction of the holy city. <span class="cmt_word">The vision is touching,</span> etc. The noun is used as a synonym for prophecy, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). It may be noted that it is specially characteristic of Ezekiel (seven times) and Daniel (eleven times). For the Authorized Version read with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">none shall return</span>, or better (with the Vulgate and Keil), <span class="accented">the vision touching the whole multitude shall not return, i.e.</span> shall go straight onward to do its work (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). So taken, there is a kind of play upon the iterated word: "The seller shall not turn his footsteps back, neither shall the prophecy." <span class="accented">Vestigia nulla retrorsum</span> shall be true of both. I take the other words, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">no man in the iniquity of his life shall strengthen himself</span>, noting the fact that the word for "strengthen" is that which enters into Ezekiel's name. It is as though he said, "God is the only true source of strength to thee, as thy very name bears witness." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.</body></html>
