In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.">Ezekiel 31:15-17</a> describe the effect of Assyria's fall. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.">Ezekiel 31:15</a> speaks of the mourning of the nations and of the drying up of the streams, or sources of Assyria's prosperity. "The deep" is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-4.htm" title="The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers to all the trees of the field.">Ezekiel 31:4</a>, the flood of waters which fertilised the great cedar; this is covered, as in mourning. "Floods" is the same word as "rivers" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-4.htm" title="The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers to all the trees of the field.">Ezekiel 31:4</a>, and "great waters" as "multitude of waters" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-5.htm" title="Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.">Ezekiel 31:5</a>. "To mourn" is, literally, <span class= "ital">to be black,</span> and the sense is well given in our version, although the original is more appropriate to the figure of Lebanon with its cedars. "The trees of the field" are, of course, the subordinate potentates, who are dismayed, "faint," at Assyria's fall. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/26-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the middle of you?">Ezekiel 26:15-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I covered the deep for him</span>. The face of the whole world of nature is painted by the prophet as sharing in the awe and terror of that tremendous fail Lebanon was made to <span class="cmt_word">mourn</span> (literally, to be <span class="accented">black</span>), the waters failed in their channels, the trees (all that drink water) shuddered. They formed part, as it were, of the pageantry of woe at the funeral of the fallen kingdom. It is as if the prophet felt, in all its intensity, what we have learnt to call the sympathy of nature with the sorrows of humanity. It would, perhaps, be over-literal to press details; but the picture, in one of its features at least, suggests a failure of the inundation of the Nile, like that indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-12.htm">Ezekiel 30:12</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:10-18 The king of Egypt resembled the king of Assyria in his greatness: here we see he resembles him in his pride. And he shall resemble him in his fall. His own sin brings his ruin. None of our comforts are ever lost, but what have been a thousand times forfeited. When great men fall, many fall with them, as many have fallen before them. The fall of proud men is for warning to others, to keep them humble. See how low Pharaoh lies; and see what all his pomp and pride are come to. It is best to be a lowly tree of righteousness, yielding fruit to the glory of God, and to the good of men. The wicked man is often seen flourishing like the cedar, and spreading like the green bay tree, but he soon passes away, and his place is no more found. Let us then mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</body></html>
