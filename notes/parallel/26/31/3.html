The Hebrew text, as rendered in all versions and interpreted by most commentators, gives us, in the form of the parable of the cedar, the history of the Assyrian empire in its glory and its fall. That had passed away in spite of its greatness, and so should Egypt. The question in Ver. 18 takes the place of "Thou art the man!" in Nathan's interpretation of his parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), or the <span class="accented">mutato nominee de te fabula, narratur</span> of the Roman satirist. Some recent commentaters, however, either like Ewald, taking the Hebrew word for, Assyrian" as describing a particular kind of cedar or fir tree, or, like Comill and amend, adopting a conjectural emendation of the text which actually gives that meaning (<span class="accented">Tasshur</span> for <span class="accented">Asshur</span>), refer the whole parable primarily to Egypt, and dwell on the fact that the words of Vers. 10, 18 are addressed to the living representative of a great monarchy, and not to a power that has already passed away into the Hades of departed glory. The former view seems to me the more tenable of the two, and I therefore adopt it throughout the chapter. It may be admitted, however, that the inner meaning of the parable at times breaks through the outward imagery, as was indeed to be expected, the prophet seeking to apply his apologue even before he had completed it. The "cedar in Lebanon" has already met us as the symbol of s kingdom, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The shadowing shroud</span> may be noted as a specially vivid picture of the peculiar foliage of the cedar rendered with singular felicity. <span class="cmt_word">His top was among the thick boughs</span>; better, <span class="accented">clouds, as</span> in the margin of the Revised Version. So Keil, Smend, and others (comp. Vers. 10, 14). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-9 The falls of others, both into sin and ruin, warn us not to be secure or high-minded. The prophet is to show an instance of one whom the king of Egypt resembled in greatness, the Assyrian, compared to a stately cedar. Those who excel others, make themselves the objects of envy; but the blessings of the heavenly paradise are not liable to such alloy. The utmost security that any creature can give, is but like the shadow of a tree, a scanty and slender protection. But let us flee to God for protection, there we shall be safe. His hand must be owned in the rising of the great men of the earth, and we must not envy them. Though worldly people may seem to have firm prosperity, yet it only seems so.</body></html>
