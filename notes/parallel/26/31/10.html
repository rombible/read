The future may also have been used because the object of this parable is not Assyria, but Egypt, whose fall was still to come. At the outset Assyria is directly addressed in the second person in the vividness of the description, but the third person is used afterwards. The ground of the judgment upon Assyria is its pride, on which <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/18-32.htm" title="Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and listen not to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.">2Kings 18:32-35</a> may be considered a commentary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast lifted up thyself</span>.

For <span class="cmt_word">boughs</span> read <span class="accented">clouds</span>, as in Ver. 3. Ezekiel writes as with the feeling which led Solon to note that the loftiest trees are those which are most exposed to the strokes of the thunderbolts of Zeus (Herod., 7:10). The Assyrian's heart was "lifted up with pride" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>), and therefore he was delivered to the <span class="cmt_word">mighty one of the nations</span>; sc. to Nebuchadnezzar. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:10-18 The king of Egypt resembled the king of Assyria in his greatness: here we see he resembles him in his pride. And he shall resemble him in his fall. His own sin brings his ruin. None of our comforts are ever lost, but what have been a thousand times forfeited. When great men fall, many fall with them, as many have fallen before them. The fall of proud men is for warning to others, to keep them humble. See how low Pharaoh lies; and see what all his pomp and pride are come to. It is best to be a lowly tree of righteousness, yielding fruit to the glory of God, and to the good of men. The wicked man is often seen flourishing like the cedar, and spreading like the green bay tree, but he soon passes away, and his place is no more found. Let us then mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</body></html>
