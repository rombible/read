Bible,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Kiriathaim</span>. The dual form of the name (equivalent to "Two cities") implies, perhaps, the union of an old and new town, or two towns on the opposite sides of a brook or wady. The name appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1, 23</a>. It has been identified with <span class="accented">El-Teym</span>, about two miles from Medeba (Burckhardt), and with <span class="accented">Kurei-yat</span>, on the south side <span class="accented">of Jebel Attarus</span>. Eusebius ('Onom.,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.) describes it as about ten miles from Medeba, and close to the Baris, lint nothing is known as to the last-named place. The three cities all belonged to the region which Sihon and Og had conquered from the Moabites before Israel obtained possession of them, and they were afterwards claimed as belonging to the Israelites by right of conquest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-23.htm">Judges 11:23</a>), and them may therefore be a touch of irony in Ezekiel's language describing them as Moabite cities. Collectively they were <span class="cmt_word">the glory of the country</span>, the region known as <span class="accented">the Belka</span>, in which they were situated, giving the best pasturage, then as now, in Southern Syria. Havernick quotes a Bedouin proverb, "There is no land like Belka" (see Tristram's 'Land of Moab,' pp. 275, 303-305, 350). Kirjath and Baal-meon appear in Mesha's inscription on the Moabite Stone. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-17 Though one event seem to the righteous and wicked, it is vastly different. Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath.</body></html>
