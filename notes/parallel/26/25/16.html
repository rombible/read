The name is supposed by many to be equivalent to <span class= "ital">Cretans, </span>and to indicate the origin of the Philistines from the island of Crete; but the etymology is doubtful. The reason for the introduction of their name here was probably a <span class= "ital">paronomasia </span>in the original, the phrase "I will cut off the Cherethim" reading <span class= "ital">I will slay the slayers.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Cherethims</span>. The name appears, coupled with the Philistines, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>, and has been supposed to be connected with Crete as the region from which they came, or in which they afterwards settled. By many writers both names are identified with the Cherethites and Pelethites, who appear as David's body-guard in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>, and who are supposed to represent a body of mercenary or subject troops formed out of the two nations. Both Ezekiel and Zephaniah connect the Cherethims with a paronomasia, the verb <span class="cmt_word">I will cut off</span> being almost identical in sound with it.

Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath.</body></html>
