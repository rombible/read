At times they held the greater part of the land of Israel in subjection, and at times were subdued in their turn. Although belonging to another branch of the Hamitic family, their land was included with that of the Canaanites in the territory to be given to the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/13-2.htm" title="This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,">Joshua 13:2-3</a>). It was never, however, occupied by them, although the cities were fortified and garrisoned by some of the kings. The land lay along the coast of the Mediterranean, on the highway between Egypt and Assyria and Chaldaea, and consequently, in the struggles of those nations with each other the Philistines were gradually more and more reduced, until they disappeared entirely. Among the many prophecies against them, the following may be especially referred to: <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/14-29.htm" title="Rejoice not you, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote you is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.">Isaiah 14:29-32</a>; Jeremiah 47; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/1-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:">Amos 1:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zephaniah/2-4.htm" title="For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.">Zephaniah 2:4-7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The sin of the Philistines is virtually the same as that of the Edomites. They also had a perpetual hatred. Century after century they had been, with various fortunes, the enemies of Israel - defeated (to confine ourselves to more recent history) by Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>) and Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), formidable under Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>) and Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>), repressed by Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>), combining with Amalek, and Ammon, and Tyre, and Assyria against Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-17 Though one event seem to the righteous and wicked, it is vastly different. Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath.</body></html>
