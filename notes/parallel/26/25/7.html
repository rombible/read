It refers not to a penitent recognition of the Lord, but to an experience of His wrath so plain that they can no longer refuse to acknowledge His power (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-14.htm" title="And I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 25:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A spoil to the heathen</span>. The noun for "spoil" is not found elsewhere, but probably means "food." The Hebrew Keri, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its marginal reading, gives the same word as that rendered "spoil" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>. The meaning is substantially the same whichever word we choose. Ezekiel, it will be noticed, says nothing about the return of the Ammonites, but contemplates, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a>, entire destruction. The moaning of <span class="accented">Rabbah</span> ("great" or "populous"), the mother-city of Ammon, gives greater force to the prophecy of desolation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7. It is wicked to be glad at the calamities of any, especially of God's people; it is a sin for which he will surely reckon. God will make it appear that he is the God of Israel, though he suffers them for a time to be captives in Babylon. It is better to know Him, and to be poor, than to be rich and ignorant of him.</body></html>
