They are described as its possessors, not its conquerors; the conquest was effected by Nebuchadnezzar. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/21-20.htm" title="Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defended.">Ezekiel 21:20-23</a> he was represented as hesitating whether to attack first Judah or Ammon, and determined to the former by the Divine direction; in this attack some of the Ammonites joined his army, but he nevertheless afterwards carried out his purpose and desolated their country. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-28.htm" title="And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say you, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:">Ezekiel 21:28</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Palaces.</span>--The word properly means an enclosure for folding cattle. The same word is used in connection with tribes of the desert in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm" title="These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.">Genesis 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-10.htm" title="And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelled, and all their goodly castles, with fire.">Numbers 31:10</a>, and in both is translated <span class= "ital">castles, </span>a singularly inappropriate sense. It afterwards came to mean a dwelling-place of any kind. The Ammonites and Moabites appear to have practically constituted one nation, the latter being, for the most part, the settled, and the former the nomadic portion. After the conquest of Nebuchadnezzar the Ammonites gradually dwindled away, until lost from history. The Ptolemies founded the city Philadelphia on the site of Rabbah, and there are still extensive ruins there belonging to the period of the Roman occupation; but the Ammonites had no part in either of these successive cities. The place is now utterly without inhabitants, and the most recent traveller says, "Lonely desolation in a rich country was the striking characteristic."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of the east</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">children of the east</span>.

The word is found, in this sense, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-10.htm">Numbers 31:10</a>.

Rabbah was left undefended, and became <span class="cmt_word">a stable for the camels</span> of the Midianites and other tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>). The prediction has been slowly fulfilled. Under the Greece-Egyptian rule the city revived, was named after Ptolemy Philadel-phus, and was flourishing under the Roman Empire. Remains of temples, theatres, houses, are still found on its site, but its present desolate condition agrees with the picture drawn here by Ezekiel and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-6.htm">Jeremiah 49:6</a> implies captivity and a partial return from it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7. It is wicked to be glad at the calamities of any, especially of God's people; it is a sin for which he will surely reckon. God will make it appear that he is the God of Israel, though he suffers them for a time to be captives in Babylon. It is better to know Him, and to be poor, than to be rich and ignorant of him.</body></html>
