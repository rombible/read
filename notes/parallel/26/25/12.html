They also, during the Captivity, took possession of many towns of Judea, including Hebron (Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt., </span>xii. 8, ? 6; <span class= "ital">B. J., </span>4:9, ? 7), which were re-conquered in the time of the Maccabees. Other prophecies against Edom may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/24-18.htm" title="And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.">Numbers 24:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm" title="But they shall fly on the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand on Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.">Isaiah 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/49-7.htm" title="Concerning Edom, thus said the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?">Jeremiah 49:7-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm" title="Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.">Joel 3:19</a>, besides the extended prophecy of Ezekiel in Ezekiel 35.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah</span>, etc. The statement receives many illustrations, notably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>, and at an earlier date in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>. What had been malicious exultation (the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which Aristotle describes as the extremest type of evil) passed in the case of Edom into overt acts of hostility. The moment of Judah's weakness was seized on as an opportunity for gratifying what Ezekiel elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>) calls the "perpetual hatred" of the people against Israel, for taking vengeance for the primal wrong which Esau had suffered at the hand of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a>). (For other prophecies against Edom, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Teman</span>. The name, which signifies "South," was probably applied to a district - twice, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7, 8</a>, coupled with Dedan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-20.htm">Jeremiah 49:20, 21</a> the cry of the inhabitants of Teman is said to have been "heard in the Red Sea," and this determines its geographical position, as being, in accordance with its name, the southern region of Edom. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a> we have Eliphaz the Temanite as one of the patriarch's friends, and the same name appears as that of a son of Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>). In Jeremiah (<span class="accented">loc</span>. <span class="accented">cit</span>.) Teman is named as famous for its wisdom. Dedan is named as a grandson of Cash in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>, and of Abraham by Keturah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>. It has been inferred from this that there were two branches of the nation, one on the shores of the Persian Gulf, nomadic and trading, as in the "travelling companies" of Dedanim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15, 20</a>); the other settled in the territory of the Edomites ('Dict. Bible'). The latter is that to which Ezekiel refers. A various punctuation gives, with a better sense, "From Teman even unto Dedan they shall fall by the sword." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-17 Though one event seem to the righteous and wicked, it is vastly different. Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath.</body></html>
