"The cherub that covereth" the mercy-seat is spoken of as anointed, with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-26.htm" title="And you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,">Exodus 30:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm" title="And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.">Exodus 40:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Upon the holy mountain of God.--</span>The prophet still has his mind upon Mount Zion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm" title="They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Isaiah 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>), but yet the words are ironically spoken of Tyre as a venerated sanctuary, rising up from the sea.<p><span class= "bld">Stones of fire.</span>--An obvious explanation of this expression, given by many writers, is that it refers to the brilliant sparkling jewels on the robes in which the king walked. But if this were the case, the expression would be a strange one, and the connection implies a deeper and a religious meaning. It is better, therefore, to understand the imagery as similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-1.htm" title="To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things said he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 2:1</a>, and to suppose the prophet to have had in mind such a passage as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>, where a paved work of sapphire stone appears as beneath the feet of God, while His glory is "like a devouring fire." This would then be one of the ways in which the king of Tyre is ironically represented as assuming to himself God-like attributes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The anointed cherub that covereth</span>. The word for "anointed" is not found elsewhere, but is cognate in form with that which is commonly so rendered. The Vulgate, however, tracing it to another root, gives <span class="accented">extentus et protegens</span>, and is followed by Luther, Gesenius, Ewald, and others. Keil and Hengstenberg accept "anointed." The sequence of thought seems to be as follows: The splendor-of the King of Tyre had suggested the idea of Eden the garden of God. This, in its turn, led on to that of the cherub that was the warder of that garden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). The Paradise of God is pictured as still existing, and the cherub - we remember how prominent the word and the thing had been in Ezekiel's thoughts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-16</a>) - is there (according as we take the above words) either as its anointed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "consecrated," ruler, or as extending the protection of its overshadowing wings far and wide as the cherubim of the tabernacle extended their wings over the ark (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a>). Those cherubim, we may remember, were actually anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>). The King of Tyro boasted that he was, like them, consecrated to his office as king "by the grace of God." In that earthly Paradise the prophet saw the "holy mountain of God," the Olympus, so to speak, of the Hebrews, the throne of the Eternal (compare the Meru of India, the Albard of Iran, the Asgard of German poetry). Isaiah's words as to the King of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13, 14</a>) present a suggestive parallel. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the stones of fire.</span> The words receive their interpretation partly from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; partly from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-9.htm">2 Samuel 22:9, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>. The cherub's sword of fire is identified with the lightning-flash, and that in its turn with the thunderbolts of God. Out of the throne of God went thunders and lightnings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). The "Flammantia maenia mundi" of Lucretius (1. 73) offers a suggestive parallel. The King of Tyre, like the King of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13, 14</a>), is painted as exulting in that attribute of the Divine glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-19 Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil. Those who indulge therein must expect to perish.</body></html>
