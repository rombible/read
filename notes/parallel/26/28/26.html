and, at all events, present a suggestive parallel. The restoration was to include also the blessing of confidence and hope; no longer a groundless and false confidence, like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-37.htm">Jeremiah 2:37</a> and Jeremiah 48:13, but one resting on the fact that God was in very deed the Judge of all the earth. We may note, at the close of the chapter, how its juxtaposition of the two Phoenician cities seems to have been present to the mind of the Christ in his references to the judgment that should come upon both of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-13.htm">Luke 10:13</a>). He himself, it will be remembered, passed through the coasts of Tyre and Zidon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>), and probably, according to the best text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-24.htm">Mark 7:24</a>, actually trod the streets of the latter city. They supplied some of the great multitude of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-8.htm">Mark 3:8</a>, who listened to his teaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:20-26. The Zidonians were borderers upon the land of Israel, and they might have learned to glorify the Lord; but, instead of that, they seduced Israel to the worship of their idols. War and pestilence are God's messengers; but he will be glorified in the restoring his people to their former safety and prosperity. God will cure them of their sins, and ease them of their troubles. This promise will at length fully come to pass in the heavenly Canaan: when all the saints shall be gathered together, every thing that offends shall be removed, all griefs and fears for ever banished. Happy, then, is the church of God, and every living member of it, though poor, afflicted, and despised; for the Lord will display his truth, power, and mercy, in the salvation and happiness of his redeemed people.</body></html>
