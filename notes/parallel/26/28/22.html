God is glorified, or, as in the next clause, <span class="cmt_word">sanctified</span>, when his power and holiness are manifested in righteous judgment. (For "sanctified," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:20-26. The Zidonians were borderers upon the land of Israel, and they might have learned to glorify the Lord; but, instead of that, they seduced Israel to the worship of their idols. War and pestilence are God's messengers; but he will be glorified in the restoring his people to their former safety and prosperity. God will cure them of their sins, and ease them of their troubles. This promise will at length fully come to pass in the heavenly Canaan: when all the saints shall be gathered together, every thing that offends shall be removed, all griefs and fears for ever banished. Happy, then, is the church of God, and every living member of it, though poor, afflicted, and despised; for the Lord will display his truth, power, and mercy, in the salvation and happiness of his redeemed people.</body></html>
