He had forfeited his <span class="cmt_word">beauty</span> and his <span class="cmt_word">wisdom</span> through the pride which sought for a yet greater glory by a false and counterfeit wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will cast thee</span>, etc. The words are better taken, as in the Revised Version, in the past tense, <span class="accented">I have cast thee</span>... <span class="accented">I have laid thee before kings</span>. Pride was to have its fall, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-9.htm">Isaiah 23:9</a>. The very sanctuaries, the temples which made Tyre the "holy island," were defiled by the iniquities through which the wealth that adorned them had been gained. The "fire," instead of being a rampart of protection, should burst forth as from the center of the sanctuary to destroy him. Is there an implied allusion to the fiery judgment that fell on Nadab and Abihu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>) and on Korah and his company (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>)? The doom of <span class="accented">Sic transit gloria mundi</span> was already passed on her. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-19 Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil. Those who indulge therein must expect to perish.</body></html>
