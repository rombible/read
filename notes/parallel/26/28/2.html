The point of the charge is inordinate pride, begotten of great prosperity; this prosperity, being attributed to his own powers instead of to its true source, led him to imagine himself almost more than mortal. Similar instances of what may be called "the insanity of prosperity" may be seen in the case of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/18-33.htm" title="Has any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?">2Kings 18:33-35</a>); of the then living monarch of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, to whom this prophecy might well serve as a warning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-15.htm" title="Now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?">Daniel 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-30.htm" title="The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?">Daniel 4:30</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/11-36.htm" title="And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.">Daniel 11:36-37</a>); of Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a>); of Herod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/12-21.htm" title="And on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne, and made an oration to them.">Acts 12:21-23</a>); of the one foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2Thessalonians 2:4</a>; to which list might be added the names of some more modern conquerors, and, in their degree, of many who have been eminently successful in other walks of life, and have consequently sacrificed to their own net (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-16.htm" title="Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.">Habakkuk 1:16</a>). It is not to be supposed that the king of Tyre, like some Oriental monarchs and later Roman emperors, actually claimed for himself religious homage; but he had that proud sense of elevation and self-sufficiency which is only translated into words in the expressions of the text.<p><span class= "bld">The seat of God</span>.--This expression is chosen not merely with reference to the great natural beauty and apparently impregnable position of Tyre, but also to the fact that it was called "the holy island," and looked up to by all its colonies as the central sanctuary of their worship. The Temple of Melkarth was said by the priests to have been founded as far back as 2750 B.C., and Arrian speaks of it as the oldest sanctuary in the annals of mankind. (See also Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-6.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have set your heart as the heart of God;">Ezekiel 28:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am a God</span>. We are reminded of Isaiah's words (Isaiah 14:13, 14) as to the King of Babylon. Did Ezekiel emphasize and amplify the boasts of Ethbaal, with a side-glance at the Chaldean king, who also was lifted up in the pride of his heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>)? For like examples, see the boast of Hophra, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; and the praise given to Herod Agrippa by the Tyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21</a>). It is noticeable that St. Paul's description of the man of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>) presents the same picture in nearly the same words. <span class="cmt_word">I sit in the seat of God</span>, etc. Tyro was known as the Holy Island (Sanchon., edit. Orelli, p. 36). The city was thought of as rising from its waters like the rock-throne of God. <span class="cmt_word">Though thou set thy heart</span>. The words remind us of the temptation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>. To forget the limitations of human ignorance and weakness, to claim an authority and demand a homage which belong to God, was the sin of the Prince of Tyre, as it had been that of Sennacherib, as it was of Nebuchadnezzar, as it has been since of the emperors of Rome, and of other rulers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-19 Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind.
