The stones mentioned are the same with those in the breastplate of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-10.htm" title="And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.">Exodus 39:10</a>), the third row being omitted; this is supplied in the Greek.<p><span class= "bld">Thy pipes.</span>--The word occurs only here, and its most probable sense is <span class= "ital">females,</span> those who played upon the tambourines. All these things did not need to be collected by the king of Tyre, but were ready prepared to his hand at the moment of his accession to the throne, just as everything was made ready for Adam in Eden.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast been in Eden</span>, etc. The words are suggestive, as showing that Ezekiel was familiar with the history of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>. and 3. (compare the mention of Noah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15.htm">Ezekiel 15</a>:14, 20). To him the King of Tyre seemed to claim a position like that of Adam before his fall, perfect in beauty and in wisdom, the lord of the creation. And in that fancied Eden he stood, so he thought, not like Adam, "naked and ashamed," but like one of the cherubim that guarded the gates of the primeval Paradise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), covered with all imaginable splendor. Ezekiel returns to the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8, 16, 18</a> and Ezekiel 36:35. Other instances meet us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Every precious stone.</span> All the stones named are found in the list of the gems on the high priest's breastplate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8-14</a>). Three, however, of those gems are wanting - those in the third row of the breastplate - which are not named elsewhere; and the order is not the same. The LXX. makes the two lists identical, apparently correcting Ezekiel by Exodus. St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>) reproduces his imagery in his vision of the foundation stones of the New Jerusalem, but naturally returns to the fullness of the symbolic number - twelve. Possibly the description of gold and bdellium and onyx (or beryl), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11, 12</a>, may have suggested the thought that Eden was a land of jewels. <span class="cmt_word">The workmanship of thy tabret and pipes</span>; better, <span class="accented">the service</span>. The Authorized Version and Revised Version follow Luther. Keil agrees as to "tabret" (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; elsewhere, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-12.htm">Job 21:12</a>, the Authorized Version gives "timbrels"), but takes the latter word (not found elsewhere) as identical with its feminine form, and meaning "female." He sees in the clause, accordingly, a picture of the pomp of the Tyrian king, surrounded by the odalisques of the harem, who, with their timbrels, danced to his honor as their lord and king (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-16.htm">Isaiah 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>). Havernick, who agrees with Keil, calls attention to a passage in Athenaeus (12:8. p. 531), in which Strafe, a Sidonian king, is said to have prepared for a great festival by bringing girls who played on the flute and harp from all parts of Greece. Others, however (Smend), find in both the words articles of jewelry, pearls perforated or set in gold (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a>), and so see in them the conclusion of the description of the gorgeous apparel of the king. Furst takes the words as meaning musical instruments that were of gold set with jewels. Ewald, following out the Urim and Thummim idea, takes the gems as the subject of the sentence, and translates, "they were for the work of thine oracles and divining." On the whole, the interpretation given above seems preferable. <span class="cmt_word">In the day that thou wast created</span>. The words point to the time of the king's enthronement or coronation. It was then that he appeared in all his supreme magnificence. Had Ezekiel been a witness of that ceremony? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-19 Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil. Those who indulge therein must expect to perish.</body></html>
