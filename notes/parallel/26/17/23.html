Similar prophecies are also to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>. No point is made more clear in the prophecies of the Christian dispensation than that it is to have its roots in the Jewish, that the "law shall go forth from Zion," and that the new covenant shall yet be a covenant with God's people of old. This mountain is to be understood as the representative of the centre and seat of the kingdom of Israel, and not to be confined too literally to the actual hill of Zion itself.<p><span class= "bld">Be a goodly cedar.</span>--Not like the vine of low stature; this shall grow into a strong and great tree, under whose shadow all the inhabitants of the earth shall find sustenance and protection. A similar figure is used by the contemporary prophet Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/4-20.htm" title="The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;">Daniel 4:20-21</a>), and by our Lord Himself in the parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-32.htm" title="Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.">Matthew 13:32</a>). The universality of the blessings of the Christian dispensation, in contrast with the narrowness of the Jewish, is one of its features most frequently dwelt upon both in prophecy and in the New Testament, and shall still enter into the burden of the songs of the redeemed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>). The last clause of the verse repeats and emphasises the permanence of the connection of the believer with Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:22-24 The unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of none effect. The parable of a tree, used in the threatening, is here presented in the promise. It appears only applicable to Jesus, the Son of David, the Messiah of God. The kingdom of Satan, which has borne so long, so large a sway, shall be broken, and the kingdom of Christ, which was looked upon with contempt, shall be established. Blessed be God, our Redeemer is seen even by the ends of the earth. We may find refuge from the wrath to come, and from every enemy and danger, under his shadow; and believers are fruitful in him.</body></html>
