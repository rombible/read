The imagery of the <span class="cmt_word">willow</span> (the Hebrew word occurs here only) seems suggested by Ezekiel's surroundings. No tree could stand out in greater contrast to the cedar of Lebanon than the willows which he saw growing by the waters of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>, though the word is different). The choice of the willow determined the rest of the imagery, and the <span class="cmt_word">fruitful field</span> and the great or "many" (Revised Version) waters represent Judah, possibly with reference to its being in its measure a "land of brooks of waters," of "fountains and depths," of "wheat and barley and wine" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10-12</a>). The kingdom of Zedekiah, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, was left with sufficient elements for material prosperity. That prosperity is indicated in ver. 6 by the fact that the willow became a vine. It was of "low stature," indeed, trailing on the ground. It could not claim the greatness of an independent kingdom. Its branches turned toward the planter (ver. 6); its roots were under him. It acknowledged, that is, Nebuchadnezzar's suzerainty, and so, had things continued as they were, it might have prospered. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-10 Mighty conquerors are aptly likened to birds or beasts of prey, but their destructive passions are overruled to forward God's designs.
