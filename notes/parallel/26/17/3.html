This is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-12.htm" title="Say now to the rebellious house, Know you not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and has taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;">Ezekiel 17:12</a> of "the king of Babylon." Nebuchadnezzar is compared to an eagle also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm" title="For thus said the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.">Jeremiah 49:22</a>; and Cyrus to a bird of prey in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-11.htm" title="Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country: yes, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.">Isaiah 46:11</a>. He has great and long wings, because he has already flown victoriously over wide-spread lands; and he is "full of feathers which had divers colours," because he had embraced in his empire a variety of nations differing in languages, manners, and customs.<p><span class= "bld">Came unto Lebanon.</span>--Jerusalem is called Lebanon, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm" title="O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make your nest in the cedars, how gracious shall you be when pangs come on you, the pain as of a woman in travail!">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; because Lebanon is the home of the cedar, and the royal palace in Jerusalem was so rich in cedar as to be called "the house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm" title="He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.">1Kings 7:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The highest branch.</span>--This is a word occurring only in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on an high mountain and eminent:">Ezekiel 17:22</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/31-3.htm" title="Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.">Ezekiel 31:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-10.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have lifted up yourself in height, and he has shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;">Ezekiel 31:10</a>). It is of uncertain etymology, but is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-4.htm" title="He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.">Ezekiel 17:4</a> as meaning "the top of his young twigs." The English <span class= "ital">branch </span>hardly conveys the exact idea, and it would be better to translate "topshoot."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The eagle with <span class="cmt_word">great wings and long pinions</span> (Revised Version) probably the golden eagle, the largest species of the genus - stands for Nebuchadnezzar, as it does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a> the "ravenous bird" represents Cyrus. Possibly the eagle head of the Assyrian god Nisroch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>) may have impressed the symbolism on Ezekiel's mind. A doubtful etymology gives "the great eagle" as the meaning of <span class="accented">Nisroch</span>. The <span class="cmt_word">divers colours</span> indicate the variety of the nations under the king's sway (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>: 4:1). If the cedar was chosen to t,e the symbol of the monarchy of Judah, then it followed that Lebanon, as the special home of the cedar, should take its place in the parable. Possibly the fact that one of the stateliest palaces of Solomon was known as the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17, 21</a>) may have made the symbolism specially suggestive. The word for highest branch is peculiar to Ezekiel (here and in ver. 22). The branch so carried off was carried into "a land of traffick" (Hebrew, LXX., and Vulgate, "a land of Canaan," the word being generalized in its meaning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-29.htm">Ezekiel 16:29</a>), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to Babylon, as pre-eminently the merchant city of the time. This, of course, refers to Nebuchadnezzar's deportation of Jeconiah and the more eminent citizens of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8-15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-10 Mighty conquerors are aptly likened to birds or beasts of prey, but their destructive passions are overruled to forward God's designs. Those who depart from God, only vary their crimes by changing one carnal confidence for another, and never will prosper.</body></html>
