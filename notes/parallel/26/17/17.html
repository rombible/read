In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/37-5.htm" title="Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 37:5-11</a>, it is said that an Egyptian army did come up and temporarily raise the siege of Jerusalem; but it was of no avail. Pharaoh did him no good--did not "make for him in the war." The Chaldaeans speedily returned, drove away the Egyptians, and renewed the siege, finally capturing and burning the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By casting up mounts,</span> etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">when they cast up mounts</span>. The words describe the strategical operations, not of the Egyptians against the Chaldeans, but of the Chaldeans, when they recovered from their first alarm, against Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>). The Egyptians, Ezekiel predicts, would be powerless to prevent that second and decisive siege. In vers. 18, 19 the prophet emphasizes the fact that this would be the just punishment of Zedekiah's perfidy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:11-21 The parable is explained, and the particulars of the history of the Jewish nation at that time may be traced. Zedekiah had been ungrateful to his benefactor, which is a sin against God. In every solemn oath, God is appealed to as a witness of the sincerity of him that swears. Truth is a debt owing to all men. If the professors of the true religion deal treacherously with those of a false religion, their profession makes their sin the worse; and God will the more surely and severely punish it. The Lord will not hold those guiltless who take his name in vain; and no man shall escape the righteous judgment of God who dies under unrepented guilt.</body></html>
