The sanctity of an oath had always been most strongly insisted upon in Israelitish history. It must be remembered that even when, as in the case of the Gibeonites (Joshua , 9), the oath had been obtained by fraud, and centuries had passed since it was given, God yet sorely punished the land for its violation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2Samuel 21:1-2</a>); and in this case the king had been more than once Divinely warned through the prophet Jeremiah of the danger of his treachery. As Zedekiah's intrigues with Egypt were just now going on, it was particularly important that they should be exposed, and their result foretold to the captives who were yet trusting in the safety of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they might give him horses.</span> The "chariots and horses" of Egypt seem, throughout its whole history, to have been its chief element of strength. See for the time of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28, 29</a>), of Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>), of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>: 36:9). <span class="cmt_word">Shall he prosper?</span> What had been asked in the parable is asked also, in identical terms, in the interpretation. Ezekiel presses home the charge of perfidy as well as rebellion. Like Jeremiah, he looks on Nebuchadnezzar as reigning by a Divine right. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:11-21 The parable is explained, and the particulars of the history of the Jewish nation at that time may be traced. Zedekiah had been ungrateful to his benefactor, which is a sin against God. In every solemn oath, God is appealed to as a witness of the sincerity of him that swears. Truth is a debt owing to all men. If the professors of the true religion deal treacherously with those of a false religion, their profession makes their sin the worse; and God will the more surely and severely punish it. The Lord will not hold those guiltless who take his name in vain; and no man shall escape the righteous judgment of God who dies under unrepented guilt.</body></html>
