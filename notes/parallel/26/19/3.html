In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-6.htm" title="And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.">Ezekiel 19:6</a> Jehoiachin is also spoken of particularly. These two are mentioned as examples of all the other kings after Josiah. Jehoiakim and Zedekiah are simply passed over, although it may be that the prophet looked upon them as creatures of Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar rather than as legitimate kings of Israel. Jehoiakim, moreover, died in Jerusalem, and Zedekiah was at this moment still upon the throne.<p><span class= "bld">It devoured men.</span>--This at once keeps up the figure, and has also its special justification in the evil courses of Jehoahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-32.htm" title="And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.">2Kings 23:32</a>).

A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.">Ezekiel 19:2</a>, Israel as a whole is represented as going aside from her high calling as a theocracy, and making herself "like the nations round about."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The whelp, as ver. 4 shows, is Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>), who "did evil" in the sight of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-32.htm">2 Kings 23:32</a>), the words that follow pointing to cruelty and oppression like that of Zedekiah. The passage finds a somewhat striking parallel in AEschylus, 'Agam.,' 695-715. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-9 Ezekiel is to compare the kingdom of Judah to a lioness. He must compare the kings of Judah to a lion's whelps; they were cruel and oppressive to their own subjects. The righteousness of God is to be acknowledged, when those who have terrified and enslaved others, are themselves terrified and enslaved. When professors of religion form connexions with ungodly persons, their children usually grow up following after the maxims and fashions of a wicked world. Advancement to authority discovers the ambition and selfishness of men's hearts; and those who spend their lives in mischief, generally end them by violence.</body></html>
