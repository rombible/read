The duty of the prophet, therefore, is not only to seek to turn the wicked from his evil way, but also to warn the righteous against falling into the same path. Both terms must necessarily be taken as comparative; but they show that there was even now a considerable difference in character among the captives.<p><span class= "bld">I lay a stumblingblock before him.--</span>A "stumbling-block" is anything at which people actually stumble, whether intended for that purpose or, on the contrary, designed for their highest good. Thus Christ is foretold as a stumbling-block to both the houses of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>), and is several times spoken of as such by the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-32.htm" title="Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone;">Romans 9:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>). The word is used oftener by Ezekiel than by all the other Old Testament writers together; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm" title="They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.">Ezekiel 7:19</a> the riches of the people are spoken of as their stumbling-block, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-12.htm" title="Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, said the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.">Ezekiel 44:12</a> (marg.) the sinful Levites are described as a stumbling-block. The meaning here is plainly, "when a man perverts any of God's gifts or providences into an occasion of sin."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From his righteousness.</span> The Hebrew gives the plural, "his righteousnesses" - all his single righteous acts that lie behind. <span class="cmt_word">I lay a stumbling block,</span> etc. The word is again characteristic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3, 4</a>). It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a>, and Ezekiel may have learnt the use of the word from him. It is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; but the date of these, according to the so called higher criticism, may be later than Ezekiel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>: the word is different. The English word sufficiently expresses the sense. One of the acts of Eastern malignity was to put a stone in a man's way, that he might fall and hurt himself Here the putting the stone is described as the act of Jehovah, and is applied to anything that tempts a man to evil, and so to his own destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a>). The thought is startling to us, and seems at variance with true conceptions of the Divine will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>). The explanation is to be found in the fact that the prophet's mind did not draw the distinction which we draw between evil permitted and the same evil decreed. All, from this point of view, is as God wills, and even those who thwart that will are indeed fulfilling it. Glimpses are given of the purpose which leads to the permission or decree. In the case now before us the man has turned from his righteousness before the stumbling block is laid in his way. The temptation is permitted that the man may become conscious of his evil (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>). If the prophet preacher does his duty, the man may conquer the temptation, and the stumbling block may become a "stepping stone to higher things." If, through the prophet's negligence, h<span class="cmt_word">e</span> comes unwarned, and stumbles and falls, he, as in the case of the wicked, bears the penalty of his guilt, but the prophet has here also the guilt of blood upon his soul. The "righteousnesses" of the man (here, as before, we have the plural), his individual acts of righteousness, shall not be remembered, because he was tried, and found wanting in the essential element of all righteousness. The highest development of the thought is found in the fact that Christ himself is represented as a "stumbling stone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). St. Paul's solution of the problem is found in the question, "Have they stumbled that they should fall?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>). Was that the end contemplated in the Divine purpose Will it really be the end? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This mission made the holy angels rejoice. All this was to convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins. Surely then the hearers of the gospel should desire warnings, and even reproofs.</body></html>
