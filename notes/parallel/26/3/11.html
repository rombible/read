At this time, and for several years to come, this was a comparatively small part of the whole nation; but before Ezekiel's ministrations were finished it embraced the mass of them. (See Introd., III.) It is noticeable that God directs him to go, not to <span class= "ital">My, </span>but to <span class= "ital">thy </span>people; just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-3.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.">Ezekiel 2:3</a> He speaks of them as heathen, so here He refuses to recognise them in their present state as really His people. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:">Exodus 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm" title="Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them, When I bring the sword on a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:">Ezekiel 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm" title="Therefore, you son of man, say to the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sins.">Ezekiel 33:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm" title="Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.">Ezekiel 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm" title="Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.">Daniel 10:14</a>.) At the same time, there is thus indirectly suggested to the prophet a reminder that he is himself one of the same people, and needs therefore to be on his guard against the sin and obduracy which characterise them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Get thee to them of the Captivity,</span> etc. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3</a> and Ezekiel 3:1, 4 the mission had been to "the house of Israel" generally; now it is specialized. He is sent "to them of the Captivity." They are the rebellious house. There is an obvious significance in the phrase, "<span class="accented">thy</span> people." Jehovah can no longer recognize them as his. The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a> are repeated. Here also, even among the exiles, who were better than those that remained in Judah, he was to expect partial failure, but he was not, on that account, to shirk the completion of his task. <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord God;</span> <span class="accented">Adonai Jehovah</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Ezekiel was to receive the truths of God as the food for his soul, and to feed upon them by faith, and he would be strengthened. Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him. He must continue earnest in preaching, whatever the success might be.</body></html>
