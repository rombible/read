Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.">Jeremiah 37:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm" title="Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.">Jeremiah 38:6</a>); but nothing of this kind is to be understood here. There is no trace of such treatment throughout the book, nor is it likely that it would have been suffered by Nebuchadnezzar among his captives, or possible under the administration of Daniel. Besides, a similar laying of bands upon him (although for a different purpose) is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-8.htm" title="And, behold, I will lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from one side to another, till you have ended the days of your siege.">Ezekiel 4:8</a>, which must necessarily be understood figuratively. The compulsion described in this and the following verse was a moral one. Ezekiel's countrymen, especially during the period of his warnings until the destruction of Jerusalem, should so absolutely refuse to hear him, that it would become practically impossible for him to declare his prophecies; he would be as if he were bound.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall put bands</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon thee,</span> etc. Did the warning mean that the prophet's hearers would treat him as the men of Jerusalem treated Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>)? Of this, at all events, we have no record, and so far we are led to the other alternative of taking the words (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-8.htm">Ezekiel 4:8</a>) in a figurative sense. The prophet would feel, as he stood in the presence of the rebellious house, as tongue tied, bound hand and foot by their hardness of heart, teaching by strange and startling signs only, and, it may be, writing his prophecies. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a>, four years later, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>, we have a distinct reference to a long period of such protracted silence. We may compare, as in some sense parallel, the silence of Zacharias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>). That silence unbroken for nine months was a sign to those who "were looking for redemption in Jerusalem," more eloquent than speech. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-27 Let us own ourselves for ever indebted to the mediation of Christ, for the blessed intercourse between God and man; and a true believer will say, I am never less alone than when thus alone. When the Lord opened Ezekiel's mouth, he was to deliver his message boldly, to place life and death, the blessing and the curse, before the people, and leave them to their choice.</body></html>
