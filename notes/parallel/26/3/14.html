Elsewhere it is rendered as "wrath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), "fury" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>). Here probably it points to the conflict of emotions - indignation against the sins of his people, the dread of failure, the consciousness of unfitness. <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the Lord,</span> etc. The word for "strong" is the same as that which enters into Ezekiel's name. Taking this and ver. 9 into account, there seems sufficient reason for translating as the Vulgate does, <span class="accented">confortans</span> (so Luther, "held me firm"), at least for thinking of that meaning as implied (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-18.htm">Ezra 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>). There was a sustaining power in spite of the "bitterness" and the "heat." In a more general sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, it is used as implying a special intensity of prophetic inspiration, as in the case of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>); but this is the only case in which it occurs with the adjective "strong." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This mission made the holy angels rejoice. All this was to convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins. Surely then the hearers of the gospel should desire warnings, and even reproofs.</body></html>
