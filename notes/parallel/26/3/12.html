and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm" title="Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the LORD's house, which looks eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.">Ezekiel 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-24.htm" title="Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm" title="And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.">Acts 8:39</a>.) In the last case the "taking up" is expressly said to have been in vision. This closes one act, so to speak, of the prophet's consecration, and now the vision which he has been seeing all along leaves him for a time. He hears the great voice of ascription of praise, without definite mention of its source, but doubtless, as in Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4, from all that surround the throne; and he hears the noise of the moving wings of the cherubim, and of the wheels. He has seen the representation of the glory of Him who sends him, and has heard the character of his message. He must now, in the light of this knowledge, see those to whom he is sent. The Hebrew for "wings that touched one another" is beautifully figurative: "wings that kissed each one its sister."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the Spirit</span> <span class="cmt_word">took me up,</span> etc. The words are to be interpreted as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Luther, however, gives "a wind lifted me up." The parallels of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> (where, however, we have the addition, "in the visions of God") and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a> suggest the conclusion that this was a purely subjective sensation, that it was one of the phenomena of the ecstatic state, and that there was no actual change of place. On the other hand, the use of like language in the cases of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16</a>), of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-12.htm">Mark 1:12</a>), of Philip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>), would justify the inference that the prophet actually passed from one locality to the other. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a> probably points to the true solution of the problem. The ecstatic state continued, and in it Ezekiel went from the banks of Chebar to the dwellings of the exiles at Tel-Abib (see note on ch. 1.), at some distance from it. <span class="cmt_word">I heard behind me,</span> etc. The words imply that the prophet, either in his vision or in very deed. had turned from the glory of the living creatures and of the wheels, and set his face in the direction in which he was told to go. As he does so, he hears the sounds of <span class="cmt_word">a great rushing</span> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Luther, "earthquake"), followed by words which, though in the form of a doxology, uttered, it may be presumed, by the living creatures, were also a message of encouragement. His readiness to do his work as a preacher of repentance calls forth the praise of God from those in whose presence there is "joy over one sinner that repenteth." We are reminded of the earthquake in the Mount of Purification and the <span class="accented">Gloria, in excelsis</span> of Dante ('Purg.,' 20:127-141; 21:53-60). The words, <span class="cmt_word">from his</span> <span class="cmt_word">place</span> (belonging, probably, to the narrative rather than the doxology), point, not to the sanctuary at Jerusalem, which Jehovah had forsaken, but to the region thought of as in the north (see note on Ezekiel 1:4), to which he had withdrawn himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This mission made the holy angels rejoice. All this was to convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins. Surely then the hearers of the gospel should desire warnings, and even reproofs.</body></html>
