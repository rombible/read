The seven days' session of amazement came to an end, but even then there was at first no utterance of a message. The word of the Lord came to his own soul, and told him what his special vocation as a prophet was to be. He was to be a "watchman unto the house of Israel." He was, like the watchman of a city on his tower, to be on the look out to warn men against coming dangers, not to slumber on his post. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24-27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17-20</a> we have vivid pictures of such a work. It had already been used figuratively of the prophet's work by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>). The cognate verb, with the image fully developed, meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>. Its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-8.htm">Hosea 9:8</a> is doubtful as to meaning, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a> and Isaiah 56:10 it may be, if we accept the theory of a Deutero-Isaiah, an echo from Ezekiel. It is reproduced with special emphasis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2-7</a>. More than any word it describes the special characteristic of Ezekiel's work. He is to watch personally over individual souls. So in a like sense, a corresponding word is used of the Christian ministry in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a> (compare also for the thought, though the word is not the same, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>). A vivid picture of the work of such a watchman is found, it may be noted, in the opening speech of the 'Agamemnon' of AEschylus. <span class="cmt_word">Give them warning,</span> etc. It is, I think, a legitimate inference that the prophet acted on the command while he was with the exiles and before the departure of ver. 22, not by harangues or sermons addressed to the whole body of the exiles, but by direct warning to individuals. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This mission made the holy angels rejoice. All this was to convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins. Surely then the hearers of the gospel should desire warnings, and even reproofs.</body></html>
