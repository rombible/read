When the watchman saw danger coming, he was to blow the trumpet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-3.htm">Ezekiel 33:3-6</a>). The prophet was to speak his warnings. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely die;</span> literally, <span class="accented">dying thou shalt die</span>. Were the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> in the prophet's mind? <span class="cmt_word">To save his life;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for his life</span>, or <span class="accented">that he may live.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Shall die in his iniquity.</span> Do the words refer only to physical death coming as the punishment of iniquity? or do they point onward further to the judgment that follows death, the loss of the inheritance of eternal life which belongs to those whose names are written in the book of life? Looking to the tremendous responsibility implied in the words, we can hardly, I think, in spite of the questions which have been raised as to the belief of the Hebrews in the immortality of the soul, hesitate to accept the latter meaning. Ezekiel anticipates the teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, if, indeed, that meaning was not already familiar to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32, 33</a>. For "in" his iniquity we may, perhaps, read "because of." The negligence of the watchman does not avail to procure a full pardon for the evil doer. The degree in which it may extenuate his guilt depends on conditions known to God, but not to us. In any case, as in our Lord's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>), a man's knowledge and opportunities are the measure of his responsibility. But the unfaithful watchman has his responsibility. It is as though the blood of the sinner had been shed. His guilt may be described in the same words as that of Cain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>). Compare St. Paul's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a> and Acts 20:26 as echoes of Ezekiel's thought. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This mission made the holy angels rejoice. All this was to convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins. Surely then the hearers of the gospel should desire warnings, and even reproofs.</body></html>
