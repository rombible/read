Of course it must have a different shade of meaning in its application to the rebellious people and to the prophet; but the main thought is taken from the figure of horned animals in their contests, and God promises Ezekiel to make him in the struggle stronger than those who oppose him. The same thing is expressed by another figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-9.htm" title="As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 3:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have made thy face strong;</span> literally, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">hard.</span> Ezekiel's name was at once <span class="accented">nomen et omen.</span> Hard as Israel might be, he could be made <span class="accented">harder, i.e.</span> stronger, than they, end should prevail against them (compare the parallels of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>). The boldness of God's prophets is a strictly supernatural gift. Whatever persistency there may be in evil, they will be able to meet it, perhaps to overcome it, by a greater persistency in good. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Ezekiel was to receive the truths of God as the food for his soul, and to feed upon them by faith, and he would be strengthened. Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him. He must continue earnest in preaching, whatever the success might be.</body></html>
