The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate you, and the interpretation thereof to your enemies.">Daniel 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/9-3.htm" title="And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonished.">Ezra 9:3-4</a>. The word implies a fixed and determined silence. <span class= "ital">"To be silent </span>was the characteristic of mourners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-28.htm" title="He sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne it on him.">Lamentations 3:28</a>); <span class= "ital">to sit, </span>their proper attitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-26.htm" title="And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit on the ground.">Isaiah 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-1.htm" title="How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!">Lamentations 1:1</a>); <span class= "ital">seven days, </span>the set time of mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-13.htm" title="So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.">Job 2:13</a>)." By this act the prophet shows his deep sympathy with his people in their affliction. This week of silent meditation among those to whom he was commissioned to speak corresponds, as already said, to the week of the consecration of his fathers to their priestly office (Leviticus 8). Such a season of retirement and thought has been given to other great religious leaders--to Moses, in his forty years of exile; to Elijah, in his forty days in Mount Horeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/19-4.htm" title="But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.">1Kings 19:4-8</a>); to St. Paul, in his journey to Arabia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17</a>); and to our Lord Himself, when He went into the wilderness after His baptism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At Tel-Abib,</span> etc., We now enter on the first scene of the prophet's ministry. The LXX. leaves the proper name. The Vulgate rightly translates it as <span class="accented">acervus novarum frugum</span>, the "mound of ears of corn" (the meaning appears in the name of the Passover month, Abib). Luther gives, strangely enough, "where the almond trees stood, in the mouth Abib"). Jerome's suggestion, that here also there was a <span class="accented">nomen et omen.</span> and that those who shared Ezekiel's exile were regarded as the "firstfruits" of the future, is at least ingenious, and finds some support in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-5.htm">Psalm 126:5, 6</a>. The place has not been identified, and its position depends on that of the river with which it is connected (see note on Ezekiel 1:1). The word "Tel" is commonly applied to the mounds formed out of masses of ruins, which are common all over the plains of Mesopotamia. The name in this case may suggest that the earth had gathered over it, and that it was cultivated. <span class="cmt_word">I sat where they sat</span>, etc. The ministry begins not with speech, but silence. Our Western habits hardly enable us to enter into the impressiveness of such a procedure. The conduct of Job's friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>) presents a parallel, and as Ezekiel seems to have known that book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>), he may have been influenced by it. Like actions meet us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This mission made the holy angels rejoice. All this was to convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins. Surely then the hearers of the gospel should desire warnings, and even reproofs.</body></html>
