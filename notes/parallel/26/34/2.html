In the passage in Jeremiah 23 they are treated under this name separately from the prophets and priests, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm" title="The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.">Jeremiah 2:8</a> they are distinguished from prophets and priests. The name itself is a peculiarly appropriate one, and seems to have been in use throughout the East, but especially in Israel, from the time when David was taken from the care of the flocks to feed the Lord's people. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-2.htm" title="Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel.">2Samuel 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-70.htm" title="He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:">Psalm 78:70-71</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That do feed themselves.--</span>This selfishness is characteristic of the unfaithful shepherd (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1-17</a>), and is enlarged upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/34-3.htm" title="You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but you feed not the flock.">Ezekiel 34:3-4</a>. The history shows that for a long time it had been eminently true of the rulers, and especially of the kings of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy against the shepherds of Israel</span>, etc. Our modern associations with the words, our use of terms like" the pastoral office," "the pastoral Epistles," lead us to think of the priests and prophets, the spiritual guides of the people, as being those whom the prophet has in view. In the language of the Old Testament, however, as in that of Homer ('Iliad,' 1:1. 263; 2:1. 85, etc.), the shepherds of the people are always its kings and other civil rulers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-6</a>), and those whom Ezekiel had in his thoughts were the tyrannous rulers of the house of David, like Jehoiakim and Zedekiah and their satellites. Our Christian thoughts of the word are the outcome of the leading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; but it is probably true that even there the original thought is still dominant. Christ is the "good Shepherd," because he is the true King. His ministers are shepherds as being officers in his kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?</span> The question is an appeal to the universal conscience of Israel and of mankind. No shepherd was worthy of his name who did not do that which the very name implied. He that neglects that duty is simply as a hireling or a robber (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10, 12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-6 The people became as sheep without a shepherd, were given up as a prey to their enemies, and the land was utterly desolated. No rank or office can exempt from the reproofs of God's word, men who neglect their duty, and abuse the trust reposed in them.</body></html>
