The whole verse is an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>, in part also of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a> [English version, ver. 18]. The words are less definite as to the nature of the covenant than those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, but probably the same thought underlies both. Sins are pardoned, the capacity for righteousness, righteousness itself, are given. In bright contrast with the picture of a country haunted by the lion, the jackal, and the wolf - the "evil beasts" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a> - so that no man could pass through without risk, we have that of a land from which such evil boasts have been cleared out, so that men may sleep safely even in the <span class="cmt_word">wilderness and the woods</span>. The language, however, is figurative rather than literal. As the "sheep" are the people of the true Israel, so the evil beasts must, at least, include the enemies, Chaldeans, Edomites, Philistines, and others, that had before made havoc of them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:17-31 The whole nation seemed to be the Lord's flock, yet they were very different characters; but he knew how to distinguish between them. By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.</body></html>
