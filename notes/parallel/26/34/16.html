(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-27.htm" title="For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.">Acts 28:27</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">With judgment.--</span>This does not mean, as the ambiguous sense of the English word might make it possible to suppose, <span class= "ital">with wisdom,</span> but with righteousness and authority, as is plainly seen from the connection with the following verses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will destroy the fat and the strong</span>. What follows introduces another feature into the parable, and is hardly less than an anticipation of the great scene of judgment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>. The "fat and the strong," as contrasted with the "broken" and the "sick," are, when we interpret the Darable, the noble and wealthy who, under the kings of Judah, had been allowed to work their evil will upon the people. Of these he says that <span class="cmt_word">he will feed them with</span> (better, in) <span class="cmt_word">judgment</span>, that for them there must be the discipline of punishment. They too are his sheep, but they require a different treatment from the others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:7-16 The Lord declared that he intended mercy towards the scattered flock. Doubtless this, in the first place, had reference to the restoration of the Jews. It also represented the good Shepherd's tender care of the souls of his people. He finds them in their days of darkness and ignorance, and brings them to his fold. He comes to their relief in times of persecution and temptation. He leads them in the ways of righteousness, and causes them to rest on his love and faithfulness. The proud and self-sufficient, are enemies of the true gospel and of believers; against such we must guard. He has rest for disquieted saints, and terror for presumptuous sinners.</body></html>
