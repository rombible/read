Obviously this prophecy can find its accomplishment in no merely human ruler.<p><span class= "bld">My servant David.--</span>The name of David is here put simply, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-24.htm" title="And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.">Ezekiel 34:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm" title="But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm" title="Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.">Hosea 3:5</a>, instead of the more usual designations of the Messiah as the Son, the Branch, the Offspring of David; but there can be no possible doubt of the meaning, any more than of who is meant by Elijah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>, in view of our Lord's own interpretation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-14.htm" title="And if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.">Matthew 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11-14</a>. Yet it should be remembered, if any one should incline to understand this whole prophecy literally, that if one part is to be so understood the rest must be taken in the same way; if we are to think that the prophet here foretells the literal restoration of the two kingdoms of Israel to their own land, and their union under one governor, then that governor must be David himself. The absurdity of such a supposition is one important element in showing that the whole is to be understood of a promise of spiritual blessings, and of the gathering of God's people into His Church as one flock under their Almighty Shepherd. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14-18</a>.) David, as the head of the theocracy and the ancestor of our Lord after the flesh, constantly appears in the Scriptures as the type of the Messiah, and there can be no reasonable doubt that this prophecy must have been so understood, even at the time when it was uttered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will set up one Shepherd over them</span>. Here, more than ever, we have an anticipation of our Lord's teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-18</a>. He claims to be the Fulfiller, as of the prediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-3</a>, so also of this. He, the "Son of David," is the David that inherits that among other promises. It has to be noted, however, that Ezekiel's words paint, less distinctly than those of the earlier prophets, the picture of an individual Messianic king, and seem rather to point, as do those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a> (I do not now discuss the date of that prophecy), to a line of true rulers, each faithfully representing the ideal David as the faithful Ruler, the true Shepherd of his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8, 9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:17-31 The whole nation seemed to be the Lord's flock, yet they were very different characters; but he knew how to distinguish between them. By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.</body></html>
