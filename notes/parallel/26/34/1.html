The kernel of the chapter is found in the Messianic prophecies of vers. 23, 24, as the first stage in the restoration of Israel which is beginning to open to the prophet's gaze. We can hardly avoid seeing in it the deliberate expression of words that had been spoken by Ezekiel's master (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>), and which in his case also were followed by a directly Messianic announcement. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>, still more in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-16</a>, we can scarcely avoid recognizing the distinct appropriation of the words to himself by him of whom they both had spoken. So far as we may venture to speculate on the influence, so to speak, of the words of the prophets of the Old Testament on our Lord's human soul, we may think of these as having marked out for him the work which he was to do, just as we may think of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. as having pointed out to him the path of suffering which he was to tread. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-6 The people became as sheep without a shepherd, were given up as a prey to their enemies, and the land was utterly desolated. No rank or office can exempt from the reproofs of God's word, men who neglect their duty, and abuse the trust reposed in them.</body></html>
