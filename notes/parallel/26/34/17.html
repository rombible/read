The same contrast is again expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-20.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD to them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.">Ezekiel 34:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-22.htm" title="Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.">Ezekiel 34:22</a>. It is not between "the cattle" on the one side, and "the rams and the he-goats" on the other, but between the cattle themselves, and also between the rams and he-goats themselves; all the evil, of whatever class, are to be rejected. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/34-18.htm" title="Seems it a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?">Ezekiel 34:18-19</a> are addressed to those who will be rejected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle</span>. It may be worth while to note, as modern English usage tends to limit the range of the word, that it is commonly used in the Old Testament of sheep rather than of kine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34-42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-8.htm">Genesis 31:8-12</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a> we have the same Hebrew word as that which Ezekiel uses. <span class="cmt_word">Between the rams and the he-goats</span>. The words, at first, seem to point to a division like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>, and may, perhaps, have suggested it. Here, however, the contrast lies, not between the sheep and goats as such, but between the strong and the weak of each class. The "rams" are as much the object of the shepherd's discipline of judgment as the "he-goats." Both stand as the representative of the rapacious self-seeking classes who oppressed the poor and needy, and, not content with being the first to feed on the pastures and to drink of the waters, trampled on the former and defiled the latter. So in the next verse the contrast lies between the "fat cattle," whether sheep or goats, and the "lean." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:17-31 The whole nation seemed to be the Lord's flock, yet they were very different characters; but he knew how to distinguish between them. By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.</body></html>
