(Comp. the similar figurative language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm" title="For thus has the LORD spoken to me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.">Isaiah 31:4</a>.) The centre of the old theocracy is always spoken of in Scripture as also the centre from which goes forth the new covenant of salvation, and this was historically fulfilled in the coming of Christ and the cradling of His Church in the Jewish Church. The continuity of the Church was preserved quite as fully through the Christian era as through the Babylonian captivity, quite as large a number of the Jews having embraced Christianity as ever returned from the exile in Chaldea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Round about my hill</span>.

In that land, as the prophet saw it here, and still more in the closing vision of his book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>), there were, outwardly as well as spiritually, to be <span class="cmt_word">showers of blessing</span> (the phrase is peculiar to Ezekiel), and the land should yield its fruits. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:17-31 The whole nation seemed to be the Lord's flock, yet they were very different characters; but he knew how to distinguish between them. By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.</body></html>
