<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-4.htm" title="The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers to all the trees of the field.">Ezekiel 31:4</a>, and means <span class= "ital">plantation.</span> The thought is that God would provide Israel with such a fair and fruitful land as should make them famous for their blessings. The idea of the word is not that which seems to be implied by our version (with its marginal references to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>), a plant or a branch, referring to the Messiah; a different word is used here, which occurs, besides the places named, only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm" title="Your people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.">Isaiah 60:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm" title="To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.">Isaiah 61:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-6.htm" title="Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.">Micah 1:6</a>, in all of which it is translated <span class= "ital">planting.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A plant of renown</span>. The words at first suggest the thought that Ezekiel was reproducing the ideal picture of the "branch," the "root," the "stem," the "plant." of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>. Here, however, the word is collective, and is translated "plantation" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-7.htm">Ezekiel 17:7</a>, "planting" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>. It can hardly be taken as speaking of more than the general fertility of the land. The rendering of the LXX., "a plant of peace," obviously implies a different reading (<span class="accented">shalom</span> instead of <span class="accented">shem</span>), and this Cornill has adopted in his text. So taken, the words naturally lead on to what follows - the promise that men should <span class="cmt_word">no more be consumed with hunger</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:17-31 The whole nation seemed to be the Lord's flock, yet they were very different characters; but he knew how to distinguish between them. By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.</body></html>
