It is the same assurance as that given by the Saviour in John 10, and here, as there, must necessarily be understood spiritually. In the following verses many promises are given of an earthly and temporary character, and these were fulfilled partly in the. restoration from exile, partly in the glorious deliverance of the Church from its foes under the Maccabees. But these deliverances themselves were but types of the more glorious Messianic deliverance of the future, and necessary means whereby it was secured. The promise of that deliverance could only be brought at all within the comprehension of the people by setting it forth in earthly language, just as even now it is impossible for us to understand the glories of the Church triumphant, except by the aid of the sensible images in which Scripture has portrayed them. Far less was it possible to this people, so much behind us in spiritual education and enlightenment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I, even I</span>, etc. The words, as the last reference shows, and as we find in vers. 23-31, do not exclude, rather they imply, human instrumentality, just us our Lord's do in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>; but they reveal the truth that Jehovah is the true Shepherd of his people. Not the sweet psalmist of Israel only, but the lowest outcast, might use the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, and say, "The Lord is my Shepherd." He will gather the sheep that have been scattered in the "cloudy and dark day," the day of the Lord's judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-3.htm">Ezekiel 30:3</a>). For the prophet the words pointed to that vision of a restored Israel, which was dominant in the expectations both of Isaiah (or the Deutero-Isaiah) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>, and in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-12.htm">Jeremiah 33:12-18</a>), which floated before the minds of the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>), and to which even St. Paul looked forward as the solution of the great problems of the world's history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:7-16 The Lord declared that he intended mercy towards the scattered flock. Doubtless this, in the first place, had reference to the restoration of the Jews. It also represented the good Shepherd's tender care of the souls of his people. He finds them in their days of darkness and ignorance, and brings them to his fold. He comes to their relief in times of persecution and temptation. He leads them in the ways of righteousness, and causes them to rest on his love and faithfulness. The proud and self-sufficient, are enemies of the true gospel and of believers; against such we must guard. He has rest for disquieted saints, and terror for presumptuous sinners.</body></html>
