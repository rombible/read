The figure is taken from the reeds, which grew abundantly on the banks of the Nile, and the statement is historically amplified in the following verse, where the reference is to be understood not of any single fact so much as of a continual, often repeated result. There should be a period in the middle of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-6.htm" title="And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 29:6</a>, the first half forming the conclusion of the previous denunciation, and the second half being closely connected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/29-7.htm" title="When they took hold of you by your hand, you did break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned on you, you brake, and made all their loins to be at a stand.">Ezekiel 29:7-9</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-7.htm" title="When they took hold of you by your hand, you did break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned on you, you brake, and made all their loins to be at a stand.">Ezekiel 29:7</a> is parenthetical.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A staff of reed unto the house of Israel</span>. Ezekiel reproduces the familiar image of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>. The proverb had not ceased to be true, though the rulers were different. Here, again, the imagery is strictly local. The reeds were as characteristic of the Nile as the crocodiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-3.htm">Exodus 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21</a>). The image of the reed is continued in Ver. 7, and the effect of trusting to its support is described in detail. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-16 Worldly, carnal minds pride themselves in their property, forgetting that whatever we have, we received it from God, and should use it for God. Why, then, do we boast? Self is the great idol which all the world worships, in contempt of God and his sovereignty. God can force men out of that in which they are most secure and easy. Such a one, and all that cleave to him, shall perish together. Thus end men's pride, presumption, and carnal security. The Lord is against those who do harm to his people, and still more against those who lead them into sin. Egypt shall be a kingdom again, but it shall be the basest of the kingdoms; it shall have little wealth and power. History shows the complete fulfilment of this prophecy. God, not only in justice, but in wisdom and goodness to us, breaks the creature-stays on which we lean, that they may be no more our confidence.</body></html>
