<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-12.htm" title="For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.">Exodus 7:12</a>). It unquestionably means <span class= "ital">crocodile,</span> the characteristic animal of Egypt, in some parts hated and destroyed, in some worshipped as a deity, but in all alike feared, and regarded as the most powerful and destructive creature of their country.<p><span class= "bld">Lieth in the midst of his rivers</span>.--Egypt, a creation of the Nile, and dependent entirely upon it for its productiveness, is personified by the crocodile, its characteristic animal, basking upon the sand-banks of its waters. The expression "his rivers," used of the branches of the Nile near its mouth, is peculiarly appropriate to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, to which Pharaoh-Hophra belonged, whose capital was Sais, in the midst of the Delta.<p><span class= "bld">My river is mine own.</span>--This is characteristic of the pride of Hophra, who, according to Herodotus, was accustomed to say that "not even a god could dispossess him of power." The whole dynasty to which he belonged, beginning with Psammeticus, improved the river and encouraged commerce with foreign nations, thereby acquiring great wealth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The great dragon</span>. The word is cognate with that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a> for the great "whales," monsters of the deep. The "dragon," probably the crocodile of the Nile (compare the description of "leviathan" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41.htm">Job 41</a>.) had come to be the received prophetic symbol of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">rivers</span> are the Nile-branches of the Delta. <span class="cmt_word">My river is mine own</span>. The words probably imply that Hophra, like his grandfather Necho, in his plan of a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, had given much time and labor to irrigation works in Lower Egypt. The boast which rose to his lips reminds us of that of Nebuchadnezzar as he looked on Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>). He, like the kings of Tyre and Babylon, was tempted to a self-apotheosis, and thought of himself as the Creator of his own power. The words of Herodotus (2. 169), in which he says that Apries believed himself so firmly established in his kingdom that there was no god that could cast him out of it, present a suggestive parallel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-16 Worldly, carnal minds pride themselves in their property, forgetting that whatever we have, we received it from God, and should use it for God. Why, then, do we boast? Self is the great idol which all the world worships, in contempt of God and his sovereignty. God can force men out of that in which they are most secure and easy. Such a one, and all that cleave to him, shall perish together. Thus end men's pride, presumption, and carnal security. The Lord is against those who do harm to his people, and still more against those who lead them into sin. Egypt shall be a kingdom again, but it shall be the basest of the kingdoms; it shall have little wealth and power. History shows the complete fulfilment of this prophecy. God, not only in justice, but in wisdom and goodness to us, breaks the creature-stays on which we lean, that they may be no more our confidence.</body></html>
