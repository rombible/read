It will be well, therefore, to begin with a Brief survey of the relations which existed at this period between Judah, Egypt, and Babylon. After the great defeat of Pharaoh-Necho by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish ( <span class="date">B.C. 604</span>), on which Jeremiah (46.) dwells fully, he was succeeded in <span class="date">B.C. 594</span> by his son Psammetik II. the Psammis of Herodotus 2:160, who invaded Ethiopia, and died in <span class="date">B.C. 588</span>, leaving the throne to his son Uah-prahet, the Pharaoh Hophra of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>, the Apries of Herod., 2:161. The Greek historian tells us that he attacked Tyre and Zidon, failed in an enterprise against Cyrene, and was deposed by Amasis ( <span class="date">B.C. 569</span>). Zedekiah and his counselors, following in the steps of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30</a>.) and Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46</a>.), had courted his alliance against the Chaldeans. As Ezekiel had prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-11.htm">Ezekiel 17:11-18</a>), they found that they were once more leaning on a broken reed. We have now come to <span class="date">B.C. 589</span>, when Jerusalem was actually besieged, but was still dreaming of being relieved by an Egyptian army. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-16 Worldly, carnal minds pride themselves in their property, forgetting that whatever we have, we received it from God, and should use it for God. Why, then, do we boast? Self is the great idol which all the world worships, in contempt of God and his sovereignty. God can force men out of that in which they are most secure and easy. Such a one, and all that cleave to him, shall perish together. Thus end men's pride, presumption, and carnal security. The Lord is against those who do harm to his people, and still more against those who lead them into sin. Egypt shall be a kingdom again, but it shall be the basest of the kingdoms; it shall have little wealth and power. History shows the complete fulfilment of this prophecy. God, not only in justice, but in wisdom and goodness to us, breaks the creature-stays on which we lean, that they may be no more our confidence.</body></html>
