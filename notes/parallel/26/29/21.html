These consequences were primarily the conviction of the futility of trust in any earthly aid, and hence a turning to their neglected God, and<span class= "bld">,</span> as a result of this, the giving up of their long cherished idolatries. The prophet speaks of this as only in germ, but looking on to its further development, under the figure of making a horn to bud forth, that is, to <span class= "ital">sprout</span> or <span class= "ital">grow.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm" title="There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.">Psalm 132:17</a>.) Israel's reviving prosperity should date from the destruction of its trust in earthly aid.<p><span class= "bld">The opening of the mouth.</span>--This is elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-27.htm" title="In that day shall your mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you shall be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 24:27</a>) promised to the prophet as a consequence of the fall of Jerusalem, of which he had heard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/33-21.htm" title="And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.">Ezekiel 33:21-22</a>) more than fourteen years before. There is no recorded prophecy of Ezekiel's of later date; the expression must therefore be understood of those encouraging and helpful instructions of the prophet, as the people improved under the discipline of the captivity, which it was not seen fitting to put on permanent record.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horn of the house of Israel.</span> The "horn" is, as always (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>), the symbol of power. Jeremiah's use of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>) may well have been present to Ezekiel's thoughts. That horn had been cut off, but it should begin to sprout again, and the prophet himself should resume his work as the teacher of his people, which had apparently been suspended for many years after the closing vision of the restoration of the temple and of Israel. The words justify the conclusion that Ezekiel resumed his labors after <span class="date">B.C. 572</span>. Was he watching the growth of Saiathiel or Zerubbabel? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:17-21 The besiegers of Tyre obtained little plunder. But when God employs ambitious or covetous men, he will recompense them according to the desires of their hearts; for every man shall have his reward. God had mercy in store for the house of Israel soon after. The history of nations best explains ancient prophecies. All events fulfil the Scriptures. Thus, in the deepest scenes of adversity, the Lord sows the seed of our future prosperity. Happy are those who desire his favour, grace, and image; they will delight in his service, and not covet any earthly recompence; and the blessings they have chosen shall be sure to them for ever.</body></html>
