and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he has said, The river is mine, and I have made it.">Ezekiel 29:9-12</a> a state of desolation is predicted for Egypt, which, if understood in the literal sense of the words, has certainly never been fulfilled. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-9.htm" title="And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he has said, The river is mine, and I have made it.">Ezekiel 29:9</a> it is said that it "shall be desolate and waste," and this is repeated with emphasis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-10.htm" title="Behold, therefore I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even to the border of Ethiopia.">Ezekiel 29:10</a>; while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-11.htm" title="No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.">Ezekiel 29:11</a> it is declared that neither foot of man nor foot of beast shall pass through it. There is also a difficulty in regard to the time of "forty years," mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/29-11.htm" title="No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.">Ezekiel 29:11-13</a>. No such definite period can be made out from history. The two difficulties <span class= "ital">go</span> together, and the former is explained by the latter. It has already been seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm" title="And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.">Ezekiel 4:6</a> that the prophet represents the calamity of Judah in the historic terms of their former suffering in the wilderness, without thereby intending either any specific time or any precise repetition of the same troubles they had then experienced. He does the same thing here in regard to Egypt. The people are to pass into a condition like that of the Israelites in the wilderness, in which they were to endure the judgment of God upon their sins. This is expressed, after the manner of Ezekiel, in strong concrete terms, the literal fulfilment of which was neither intended nor expected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall it be inhabited forty years</span>. It need hardly be said that history reveals no such period of devastation. Nor, indeed, would anything but the most prosaic literalism justify us in looking for it. We are dealing with the language of a poet-prophet, which is naturally that of hyperbole, and so the "forty years" stand, as, perhaps, elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>, etc.), for a period of undefined duration, and the picture of a land on which no man or beast sets foot for that of a time of desolation, and consequent cessation of all the customary traffic along the Nile. Such a period, there is reason to believe, did follow on the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar. It is implied in Vers. 17-21, which carry us to a date seventeen years later than that of the verse with which we are now dealing; and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10-12</a>. Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:20) speaks of Nebuchadnezzar as having invaded Libya. The reign of Amasis, which followed on the deposition of Hophra, was one of general prosperity as regards commerce and culture, but Egypt ceased to be one of the great world-powers after the time of Nebuchadnezzar and fell easily into the hands of the Persians under Cambyses. It is noticeable that Ezekiel does not, like Isaiah (Isaiah 19:18-25), connect the future of Egypt with any Messianic expectations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-16 Worldly, carnal minds pride themselves in their property, forgetting that whatever we have, we received it from God, and should use it for God. Why, then, do we boast? Self is the great idol which all the world worships, in contempt of God and his sovereignty. God can force men out of that in which they are most secure and easy. Such a one, and all that cleave to him, shall perish together. Thus end men's pride, presumption, and carnal security. The Lord is against those who do harm to his people, and still more against those who lead them into sin. Egypt shall be a kingdom again, but it shall be the basest of the kingdoms; it shall have little wealth and power. History shows the complete fulfilment of this prophecy. God, not only in justice, but in wisdom and goodness to us, breaks the creature-stays on which we lean, that they may be no more our confidence.</body></html>
