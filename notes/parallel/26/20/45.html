The word south, here occurring three times, is represented in the Hebrew by three separate words, which mean, by their derivation, respectively, "on the right hand" (the orientals always supposing themselves to face the east when they speak of the points of the compass)," the brilliant or <span class= "ital">"</span>mid-day direction," and "the dry land," a common name for the south of Palestine. Judaea is spoken of as "the south," because, although actually nearly west from Babylon, it could only be approached by the Babylonians from the north, on account of the great intervening desert. Hence the prophets always speak of the armies of Babylon as coming from the north (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/1-14.htm" title="Then the LORD said to me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>, &c.).<p><span class= "bld">The forest of the south field, </span>might be originally a mere poetic description of the land; but the figure is developed in the following verses, to make the forest the nation, and its trees the people which compose it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - In the Hebrew the verses that follow form the opening of the next chapter. The Authorized Version follows the LXX., the Vulgate, and Luther. The section has clearly no connection with what has preceded, and, though fragmentary in its character, seems by the words, "set thy face," to connect itself with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-2.htm">Ezekiel 21:2</a>, and to lead up to it. The words of ver. 45 imply, as always, an interval of silence and repose. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:45-49 Judah and Jerusalem had been full of people, as a forest of trees, but empty of fruit. God's word prophesies against those who bring not forth the fruits of righteousness. When He will ruin a nation, who or what can save it? The plainest truths were as parables to the people. It is common for those who will not be wrought upon by the word, to blame it.</body></html>
