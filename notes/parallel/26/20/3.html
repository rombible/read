St. Jerome thus comments on the words:--" To the holy, and to those who ask for right things, the promise is given, 'While they are yet speaking, I will say, Here I am;' but to sinners, such as these elders of Israel were, and as those whose sins the prophet proceeds to describe, no answer is given, but only a fierce rebuke for their sins, to which He adds His oath,.

Instead of hearing of the "times and seasons" of the events that were in the near future, the prophet at once enters on his stern work as a preacher. The general principle that determines the refusal to answer has been given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-9.
