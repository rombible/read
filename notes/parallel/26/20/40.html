in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.">Ezekiel 17:23</a>. The former prophecy was distinctly Messianic; in this, taken by itself, there is nothing which might not refer to the restoration from the exile. Yet in view of the parallelism and connection between the two, we can hardly avoid the supposition, that in predicting the restoration the prophetic eye looked beyond to the greater glory of the Christian dispensation, of which that restoration was a type. But, however this may be, it is not necessary to explain any of the expressions in this passage as looking for their direct and immediate fulfilment beyond the restoration under Zerubbabel.<p><span class= "bld">All the house of Israel.</span>--It has already been shown (see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-3.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.">Ezekiel 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-3.htm" title="Moreover take you to you an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 4:3</a>) that the existing nation is recognised as constituting "Israel," except where special occasion arises for distinguishing between the ten tribes and the two. Here "Israel" is used throughout for the people whom the prophet is directed to address (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-39.htm" title="As for you, O house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; Go you, serve you every one his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me: but pollute you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.">Ezekiel 20:39</a>), as is further shown by the parallel, "all of them in the land." Though the restored nation was made up chiefly of Judah and Benjamin, there were also among them considerable remnants of the other tribes; and it is declared that the offerings of them all shall be alike acceptable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - From the earlier stage of the restoration the prophet passes on to its completion. The people have come to the <span class="cmt_word">mountain of the height of Israel</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2, 3</a>). Ezekiel sees an Israel that shall at last be worthy of its name, the worship of false gods rooted out forever. The <span class="cmt_word">all of them</span> points to the breaking down of the old division between Israel and Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a>). Jehovah would accept the "heave offering" (same word as in Exodus 24:27; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14</a>, <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">al</span>.) and other oblations. The fact that Israel itself is said to be the "sweet savour" (Revised Version) which Jehovah accepts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>) suggests a like spiritual interpretation of the other offerings, though the literal meaning was probably dominant in the prophet's own thoughts. The nearest approach to a parallelism in a later age is that presented by <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>; but it is noticeable how there St. Paul avoids any words that imply the perpetuation of the temple and its ritual, and confines himself to the spiritual restoration of his brethren according to the flesh. It was given to him to see, what the prophets did not see, that that perpetuation would frustrate the purpose of the restoration; that the temple and its ritual took their places among the things that "were decaying and waxing old," and were ready to vanish away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:33-44 The wicked Israelites, notwithstanding they follow the sinful ways of other nations, shall not mingle with them in their prosperity, but shall be separated from them for destruction. There is no shaking off God's dominion; and those who will not yield to the power of his grace, shall sink under the power of his wrath. But not one of God's jewels shall be lost in the lumber of this world. He will bring the jews to the land of Israel again; and will give them true repentance. They will be overcome with his kindness: the more we know of God's holiness, the more we see the hateful nature of sin. Those who remain unaffected amidst means of grace, and would live without Christ, like the world around them, may be sure it is the way to destruction.</body></html>
