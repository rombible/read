The "statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live," cannot be the same with those described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm" title="And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.">Ezekiel 20:11</a> as "judgments which, if a man do, he shall even live in them." They are not, therefore, to be understood (as many of the fathers took them) of any part of the Mosaic law. Neither is it a sufficient explanation to say that God gave them what was intrinsically good, but it became evil to them through their sins; such a view of the law is emphatically discarded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm" title="Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.">Romans 7:13</a>. The statutes of the Mosaic law are not intended here at all, as is plain from the particular instance of the consecration of children to Moloch in the next verse. These evil statutes and judgments were those adopted from the heathen whom they had suffered to dwell among them, and from the surrounding nations. But how can the Lord say that <span class= "ital">He </span>gave these to them? In the same way that it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-17.htm" title="O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear? Return for your servants' sake, the tribes of your inheritance.">Isaiah 63:17</a>, "O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from Thy ways, and hardened our heart from Thy fear?" So also St. Paul says of the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21-28</a>) that God "gave them up to uncleanness," "unto vile affections," "to a reprobate mind;" and of certain wicked persons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>) "God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believe not the truth." And St. Stephen says of these very Israelites at this very time, "God gave them up to worship the host of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?">Acts 7:42</a>). It is part of that universal moral government of the world, to which Ezekiel so frequently refers, that the effect of disobedience and neglect of grace is to lead the sinner on to greater sin. The Israelites rebelled against the Divine government, and neglected the grace given them; the natural consequence was that they fell under the influence of the heathen. Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-9.htm" title="And if the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from the middle of my people Israel.">Ezekiel 14:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave them</span> <span class="cmt_word">also statutes that were</span> <span class="cmt_word">not good,</span> etc. The words have sometimes been understood as though Ezekiel applied these terms to the Law itself, either as speaking of what St. Paul calls its "weak and beggarly elements" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>), or as unable to work out the righteousness which it commanded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>), and the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a> and Hebrews 10:1 has been urged in support of this view. One who has studied Ezekiel with any care will not need many words to show that such a conclusion was not in his thoughts at all. For him the Law was "holy and just and good," and its statutes such that a man who should keep them should even live in them (vers. 13, 21). He is speaking of the time that followed on the second publication of that Law, and what he Says is that the people who rebelled against it were left, as it were, to a law of another kind. The baser, darker forms of idolatry are described by him, with a grave irony, as <span class="cmt_word">statutes</span> and <span class="cmt_word">judgments</span> of another kind, working, not life, but death. Sin became, by God's appointment, the punishment of sin, that it might be manifest as exceeding sinful. So Stephen says of Israel that "God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>). So St. Paul paints the corruptions of the heathen world as the result of God's giving them up to "vile affections" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24, 25</a>). So in God's future dealings with an apostate form of Christianity, the same apostle declares that "God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> may have been in Ezekiel's thoughts as asserting the same general law. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:10-26. The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred to in the new Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did great things for them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keeping of the sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of our being his people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, it is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here; and prepares us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. The Israelites rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought upon themselves. God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, yet he is not the Author of sin: there needs no more to make men miserable, than to give them up to their own evil desires and passions.</body></html>
