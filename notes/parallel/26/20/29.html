but this etymology must be considered fanciful.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the high place</span>, etc.? <span class="cmt_word">Bamah,</span> in the plural <span class="accented">Bamoth</span>, was the Hebrew for "high place." At first it was applied to the hill on which some local sanctuary stood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>), but was gradually extended, after the building of the temple as the one appointed sanctuary, to other places which were looked upon as sacred, and which became the scenes of an idolatrous and forbidden worship. Ezekiel emphasizes his scorn by a conjectural derivation of the word, as if derived from the two words <span class="accented">ba</span> ("go") and <span class="accented">mah</span> ("whither"); <span class="accented">or</span>, perhaps, <span class="accented">What comes?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a> for a parallel derivation of the word <span class="accented">marones</span>). Taking the words in their ordinary sense, they seem to express only a slight degree of contempt. "What, then, is the place to which you go?" - what is the "whither" to which it leads? But I incline (with Ewald and Smend) to see in the word "go into" the meaning which it has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a> and Genesis 19:31, and elsewhere, as a euphemism for sexual union. So later the word "Bamah" becomes a witness that those who worship in the high place go there (as in ver. 30) to commit whoredom literally and spiritually. Its name showed that it was what I have called "a chapel of prostitution" (ch. 16:24, 25). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:27-32 The Jews persisted in rebellion after they settled in the land of Canaan. And these elders seem to have thought of uniting with the heathen. We make nothing by our profession if it be but a profession. There is nothing got by sinful compliances; and the carnal projects of hypocrites will stand them in no stead.</body></html>
