He contemplates not a return straight from Babylon to Jerusalem, but a gathering from all the countries in which they had been scattered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>). When gathered, the whole nation is to be brought into <span class="cmt_word">the wilderness of the peoples,</span> bordered by many nations. This may probably point to the great Syro-Arabian desert lying between Babylon and Palestine. This was to be to them what the wilderness of Sinai had been in the time of the Exodus. There Jehovah would plead with them face to face, in the first instance as an accuser. (For <span class="cmt_word">face to face,</span> as expressing the direct revelation of Jehovah, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-4.htm">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>, and elsewhere.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:33-44 The wicked Israelites, notwithstanding they follow the sinful ways of other nations, shall not mingle with them in their prosperity, but shall be separated from them for destruction. There is no shaking off God's dominion; and those who will not yield to the power of his grace, shall sink under the power of his wrath. But not one of God's jewels shall be lost in the lumber of this world. He will bring the jews to the land of Israel again; and will give them true repentance. They will be overcome with his kindness: the more we know of God's holiness, the more we see the hateful nature of sin. Those who remain unaffected amidst means of grace, and would live without Christ, like the world around them, may be sure it is the way to destruction.</body></html>
