from this they were weaned, once for all, at the restoration, and whatever other sins may have been committed by them, into this, as a nation, they have never since relapsed.<p>With <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-44.htm" title="And you shall know that I am the LORD when I have worked with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 20:44</a> this prophecy ends, and here the chapter closes in the Hebrew and in the ancient versions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there shall ye remember</span>, etc. The words stretch far and wide, and throw light on many of the problems that connect themselves with the conversion of the sinner and the eschatology of the Divine government. The whole evil past is still remembered after repentance and forgiveness. There is no water of Lethe, such as the Greeks fabled, such as Dante dreamt of as the condition of entering Paradise ('Purg.,' 31:94-105). The self-loathing and humility which grow out of that memory, the acceptance of all the punishment of the past as less than had been deserved, - these are the conditions and safeguards of the new blessedness. Ezekiel teaches us, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, that it is possible to conceive of an eternal punishment, the punishment of memory, shame, self-loathing, as compatible with eternal life. So (in ver. 44) the prophet ends what is perhaps, the profoundest and the noblest of his discourses, his "vindication of the ways of God to man." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:33-44 The wicked Israelites, notwithstanding they follow the sinful ways of other nations, shall not mingle with them in their prosperity, but shall be separated from them for destruction. There is no shaking off God's dominion; and those who will not yield to the power of his grace, shall sink under the power of his wrath. But not one of God's jewels shall be lost in the lumber of this world. He will bring the jews to the land of Israel again; and will give them true repentance. They will be overcome with his kindness: the more we know of God's holiness, the more we see the hateful nature of sin. Those who remain unaffected amidst means of grace, and would live without Christ, like the world around them, may be sure it is the way to destruction.</body></html>
