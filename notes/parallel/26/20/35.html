The similarity is insisted upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-36.htm" title="Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 20:36</a>, and the phrase "face to face" is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-4.htm" title="The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the middle of the fire,">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>, not to show that the Lord will interpose again with the same sensible manifestations, but will plead with them in ways equally adapted, in their more advanced condition, to show them His overruling hand. As this phrase is plainly to be understood according to its sense, and not according to the letter, so it is quite idle to attempt to locate <span class= "ital">"</span>the wilderness of the people" as any material wilderness, as that of Arabia, or that between Babylonia and Palestine. The phrase must mean that wilderness condition of the people, scattered among the nations, in which the Lord will plead with them as He did with their fathers. This might refer, as some commentators think, to the state of the Jews in our own time, dispersed among all nations; but there is nothing in the connection to indicate so distant a future, and it may quite as well refer to the then approaching condition of the people. Already many thousands of them had been carried captive to Babylon; others (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm" title="He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.">Jeremiah 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-5.htm" title="But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;">Jeremiah 43:5</a>) had been scattered among all the surrounding nations; the mass of the ten tribes had long before been carried by the king of Assyria to other regions; and the large remnant still left in Judaea, influenced by their own fears, soon afterwards went down to Egypt. In Ezekiel's own life-time, Israel was scattered widely among all the prominent nations of the earth, and thus brought into the "wilderness of the people."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:33-44 The wicked Israelites, notwithstanding they follow the sinful ways of other nations, shall not mingle with them in their prosperity, but shall be separated from them for destruction. There is no shaking off God's dominion; and those who will not yield to the power of his grace, shall sink under the power of his wrath. But not one of God's jewels shall be lost in the lumber of this world. He will bring the jews to the land of Israel again; and will give them true repentance. They will be overcome with his kindness: the more we know of God's holiness, the more we see the hateful nature of sin. Those who remain unaffected amidst means of grace, and would live without Christ, like the world around them, may be sure it is the way to destruction.</body></html>
