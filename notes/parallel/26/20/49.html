It was to him a proof, as a like question was to the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-16.htm">Matthew 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-21.htm">Mark 8:21</a>) proof that those hearers were yet without understanding. The question was, for those who asked it, an excuse for hardening their hearts against remonstrances which needed no explanation. The indignation was followed by another interval of silence, during which he brooded over their stubbornness, and at last, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1</a>, the word of the Lord comes to him, and he speaks "no more in proverbs," but interprets the latest parable even in its details. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:45-49 Judah and Jerusalem had been full of people, as a forest of trees, but empty of fruit. God's word prophesies against those who bring not forth the fruits of righteousness. When He will ruin a nation, who or what can save it? The plainest truths were as parables to the people. It is common for those who will not be wrought upon by the word, to blame it.</body></html>
