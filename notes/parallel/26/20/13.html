Of direct violation of the sabbath we have but two recorded instances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-27.htm">Exodus 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32</a>); but the prophet looked below the surface, and would count a mere formal observance, that did not sanctify the sabbath, as a pollution of the holy day. (For parallel teaching in the prophets, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-27</a>; and later on in the history, probably as the result of their teaching, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15-22</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Then I said</span>. The history of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26</a> and Numbers 26:65 was probably in Ezekiel's thoughts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:10-26. The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred to in the new Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did great things for them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keeping of the sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of our being his people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, it is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here; and prepares us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. The Israelites rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought upon themselves. God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, yet he is not the Author of sin: there needs no more to make men miserable, than to give them up to their own evil desires and passions.</body></html>
