the approaching desolation should be so complete, that, like other national judgments, it should sweep away all alike. No distinction could be made in favour of those who might be less ripe in evil. Our Lord may have had this expression in mind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-31.htm" title="For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?">Luke 23:31</a>. At the close of the verse, by introducing the words "all faces," the prophet, as he so often does, breaks away from the figure to its interpretation, and shows plainly the meaning of the former.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All faces from the south to the north,</span> etc. The phrase seems, at first, to pass from the figure to the reality. Possibly, however, <span class="cmt_word">face</span> may stand for "the outward appearance," the leaves and branches, of the trees. "From the south (<span class="accented">Negeb</span>) to the north" takes the place of the older "from Dan to Beersheba" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>). Of that "fire" of judgment, it is said, as in our Lord's use of a like imagery, that it shall not be quenched (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>). It shall do its dread work till that work is accomplished. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:45-49 Judah and Jerusalem had been full of people, as a forest of trees, but empty of fruit. God's word prophesies against those who bring not forth the fruits of righteousness. When He will ruin a nation, who or what can save it? The plainest truths were as parables to the people. It is common for those who will not be wrought upon by the word, to blame it.</body></html>
