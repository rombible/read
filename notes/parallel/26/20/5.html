In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I am the LORD your God;">Ezekiel 20:5-9</a> the Lord takes up the first, or Egyptian period of the history* of Israel. The record of that period, as it has come to us in the Pentateuch, does not contain either any commands against idolatry, or any notice of the rebellion of the people against such command; but both are clearly implied. The very mission of Moses to deliver them rested upon a covenant by which they were to be the peculiar people of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/6-2.htm" title="And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the LORD:">Exodus 6:2-4</a>); the command to go into the wilderness to sacrifice to the Lord implies that this was a duty neglected in Egypt; and their previous habitual idolatries may be certainly inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm" title="And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations.">Leviticus 17:7</a>, while the disposition of their hearts is seen in their prompt relapse into the idolatry of the golden calf in Exodus 32. Their whole murmurings and rebellions were but the manifestation of their resistance to having the Lord for their God, and His will for their guide.<p><span class= "bld">Lifted up mine hand</span>--As the form of taking an oath (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-23.htm" title="I lifted up my hand to them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;">Ezekiel 20:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-14.htm" title="And you shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you for inheritance.">Ezekiel 47:14</a>). The reference is to such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/15-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.">Genesis 15:17-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm" title="And I will bring you in to the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm" title="For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>, &c. The phrase is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm" title="In the day that I lifted up my hand to them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:">Ezekiel 20:6</a>. which is a continuation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-5.htm" title="And say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I am the LORD your God;">Ezekiel 20:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the day that I lifted up mine hand.</span> The attitude was that of one who takes an oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>), and implies the confirmation of the covenant made with Abraham.
