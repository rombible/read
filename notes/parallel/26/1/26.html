The constant repetition of the words "likeness" and "appearance" is very striking throughout this vision. They occur five times in this verse, and four times in each of the two following. The prophet thus labours to make it plain that what he saw was not the realities of existing things, but certain symbolic representations given for the purpose of producing their fitting impression upon the mind. It is especially important to remember this in connection with "the <span class= "ital">likeness </span>as the <span class= "ital">appearance </span>of a man" "upon the <span class= "ital">likeness </span>of the throne." It was not the Divine Being Himself whom Ezekiel saw, but certain appearances to impress upon him the character and attributes of Him whom "no man hath seen, nor can see."<p><span class= "bld">The appearance of a man</span>--As in the case of the cherubim the form of a man, as the highest known in nature, was made the groundwork to which all their peculiarities were attached, so here, in rising to something still higher, the same basis must be retained in the impossibility of anything better; only that which is added is more vague, as being incapable of any definite description, Yet possibly there may be even her a hint at the great truth of the incarnation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The likeness of a throne.</span> The greatest glory was kept to the last. High above the azure expanse was the <span class="accented">likeness</span> of a throne (we note the constant recurrence of the word "likeness," nine times in this one chapter, as indicating Ezekiel's consciousness of the vision character of what he saw). The idea of the throne of the great King first appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>, is frequent in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>), notably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>. In the visions of St John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, and <span class="accented">passim</span>) it is the dominant, central object throughout. <span class="cmt_word">As the appearance of a sapphire stone.</span> The intense blue of the sapphire has made it in all ages the natural symbol of a heavenly purity. Ezekiel's vision reproduces that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>. It appears among the gems of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-11.htm">Exodus 39:11</a>) and in the "foundations" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>. The description of the sapphire given by Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:9), as "never transparent, and refulgent with spots of gold," suggests lapis lazuli. As used in the Old Testament, however, the word probably means the sapphire of modern jewellery (Braun, 'De Vest. Sacerd.,' p. 630, edit. 1680). <span class="cmt_word">A likeness as of the appearance of a man.</span> The throne, the symbol of the sovereignty of God over the "living creatures" and the "wheels," over the forces and the laws which they represented, is not empty. There was "a likeness as of the appearance" (we note again the accumulation of words intended to guard against the thought that what was seen was more than an approximate symbolism) "of a man." In that likeness there was the witness that we can only think of God by reasoning upward from all that is highest in our conceptions of human greatness and goodness, and thinking of them as free from their present limitations. Man's highest thought of God is that it is "a face like his face that receives him." He finds a humanity in the Godhead. It is noticeable that this preluding anticipation of the thought of the Incarnation, not recognized in the vision of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>) or Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1), appears prominently in the two prophets of the exile - here and in the memorable Messianic vision of "One like unto the ['a,' Revised Version] Son of man" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. What might have been perilously anthropomorphic in the early stages of the growth of Israel, when men tended to identify the symbol with the thing symbolized, was now made subservient to the truth which underlies even anthropomorphic thought (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>). Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' 4:20. 10), it may be noted, dwells on the fact that Ezekiel uses the words, "'haec visio similitudmis gloriae Domini,' ne quis putaret forte eum in his proprie vidisse Deum." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-28 The eternal Son, the second Person in the Trinity, who afterwards took the human nature, is here denoted. The first thing observed was a throne. It is a throne of glory, a throne of grace, a throne of triumph, a throne of government, a throne of judgment. It is good news to men, that the throne above the firmament is filled with One who appears, even there, in the likeness of a man. The throne is surrounded with a rainbow, the well-known emblem of the covenant, representing God's mercy and covenanted love to his people. The fire of God's wrath was breaking out against Jerusalem, but bounds should be set to it; he would look upon the bow, and remember the covenant. All the prophet saw was only to prepare him for what he was to hear. When he fell on his face, he heard the voice of One that spake. God delights to teach the humble. Let sinners, then, humble themselves before him. And let believers think upon his glory, that they may be gradually changed into his image by the Spirit of the Lord.</body></html>
