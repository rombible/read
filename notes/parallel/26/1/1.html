It may be added here that the concurrence of the "fifth day of the month" in connection with this epoch, and with that of Jehoiachin's captivity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a>, shows that the years of the two epochs began at the same time.<p><span class= "bld">Among the captives.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in the midst of the region where they were settled. The vision which follows was seen by Ezekiel only, and was probably vouchsafed to him in solitudes" The captives," or rather, <span class= "ital">the captivity, </span>as it is in the original, is the same word as is used of Jehoiachin in the next verse, and yet must be somewhat differently understood in the two cases. Jehoiachin was actually in prison for many years; his people, within certain limits, were free. They were more than <span class= "ital">exiles, </span>but less than prisoners. (On "the heavens were opened," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Visions of God.</span>--Not merely <span class= "ital">great visions, </span>as the Divine name is often added in Scripture to express greatness or intensity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-9.htm" title="He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.">Genesis 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>, <span class= "ital">marg., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-10.htm" title="The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.">Psalm 80:10</a>, <span class= "ital">marg.; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-3.htm" title="So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a> it may point to a connection with the book that precedes it. Here the sequence is subjective. We may think of Ezekiel as retracing the years of his life till he comes to the thirtieth. Then, as it were, he pulls himself up. That must be the starting point of what he has to say. Our English use of "now" is nearly equivalent to this. <span class="cmt_word">In the thirtieth year.</span> I incline, following Origen, Hengstenberg, Smend, and others, to refer the date to the prophet's own life. That year in Jewish reckoning was the age of full maturity. At that age the earlier Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23, 20, 39, 43, 47</a>) had entered on their duties. It is probable, though no written rule is found, that it was the normal age for the functions of the priesthood. In the case of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>) and of the Baptist it appears to have been recognized as the starting point of a prophet's work. Jeremiah's call as a "child" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; the word may, however, include adult manhood, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>) was obviously exceptional. Other theories are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the years are reckoned from the era of Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar ( <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>), dating from his throwing off the sovereignty of Assyria, and giving here the date <span class="date">B.C. 595</span> (Michaelis, Rosenmuller, Ewald, and others); but against this it may be urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that there is no evidence that that era was in use in Ezekiel's time, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that he nowhere else uses a double historical chronology. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That the years are reckoned from the discovery of the book of the Law in the reign of Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14</a>), as a turning point or era in the history of Judah (Targum, Theodoret, Jerome, Havernick), which would again bring us to <span class="date">B.C. 595</span>. This view is, however, open to the same objections as (1). We have no proof that the Jews ever reckoned from that event, and Ezekiel did not want, here or elsewhere, another point to reckon from, as far as his people's history was concerned, than the captivity of Jehoiachin. <span class="cmt_word">In the fourth month</span>. Both here and in ver. 2 the months are probably reckoned from Abib, or Nisan, the month of the Passover, with which the Jewish year began (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>), so that the fourth month, known by later Jews as Tammuz, would bring us to June or July. <span class="cmt_word">Among the captives</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the captivity</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by the river of Chebar.</span> By most earlier commentators the Chebar has been identified with the Chaboras of the Greeks (now the <span class="accented">Khabour</span>), which rises in Upper Mesopotamia, at <span class="accented">Ras-el-Ain</span>, and falls into the Euphrates at Carcesium, a city which modern geographers distinguish from the Carchemish of the Old Testament. Recent critics, however (Rawlinson, Smend, and others), have urged that this was too far north to be in the "land of the Chaldeans" (ver. 3), or Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>), and have suggested that the Chebar of Ezekiel is the <span class="accented">Nahr-Malcha</span>, or Royal Canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest of that king's irrigation works, to which, therefore, the name Chebar (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> uniting) would be appropriate. The identification of Chebar with the labor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, to which the ten tribes had been deported (whether, with Rawlinson, we think of that river as identical with the Chaboras, or still further north, near an affluent of the Tigris of the same name), must, for like reasons, be rejected. The two names are, indeed, spelt differently, with initial letters that do not interchange. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens were opened.</span> The phrase, not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Visions of God.</span> The words admit of three interpretations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Great, or wonderful, visions; as in the "mountains of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>), the "cedars of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-10.htm">Psalm 80:10</a>), the "river of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> visions sent from God; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> actual theophanies or manifestations of the Divine glory, of these <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is most in harmony with what follows, here and elsewhere, on the phrase (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>). Such a theophany constituted in his ease, as in that of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>), Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-14</a>), his call to the office of a prophet. The visions may be thought of as manifested to his waking consciousness in an ecstatic state, and are thus distinguished from the dreams of sleep (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> for the distinction between the two - "visions" belonging to the young, and "dreams" to the old). The visions of Balaam, seen in a "trance," but with his "eyes open" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3, 4</a>), and of St. Paul, "whether in the body or out of the body" he could not tell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2, 3</a>), present suggestive parallels. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.</body></html>
