The wheel was <span class= "ital">one </span>in the same sense in which the living creatures were one, yet actually four, as appears from the following verse and the whole subsequent description. In the corresponding vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-9.htm" title="And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.">Ezekiel 10:9</a>), they are at once described as four. The cherubim had been seen in the cloud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4-5</a>); now they need to be connected below with the earth, and presently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a>) above, with the throne of God. Therefore the wheel is "upon the earth," but of a great height (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm" title="As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.">Ezekiel 1:18</a>). There was a wheel in front of each of the cherubim, again forming a square, yet so that, as already said, they might in a sense be all considered as one wheel. Reference has been made for the origin of this imagery to the wheels under the <span class= "ital">ten bases </span>of Solomon's Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/7-32.htm" title="And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.">1Kings 7:32-33</a>); but there seems to be nothing either in size or form to correspond, and, so far as we know, the imagery here is purely original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold one wheel,</span> etc. As the prophet gazed, yet another marvel presented itself - a "wheel" was seen. It is "by" or "beside" (Revised Version) the living creatures, and "for each of the four faces thereof" (Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the next verse states definitely, there were four wheels. We may compare the analogues of the "wheels" of fire in the theophany of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, and the chariot of the cherubim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-18.htm">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-25 Providence, represented by the wheels, produces changes. Sometimes one spoke of the wheel is uppermost, sometimes another; but the motion of the wheel on its own axletree is regular and steady. We need not despond in adversity; the wheels are turning round and will raise us in due time, while those who presume in prosperity know not how soon they may be cast down. The wheel is near the living creatures; the angels are employed as ministers of God's providence. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels; the same wisdom, power, and holiness of God, that guide and govern the angels, by them order all events in this lower world. The wheel had four faces, denoting that the providence of God exerts itself in all parts. Look every way upon the wheel of providence, it has a face toward you. Their appearance and work were as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. The disposals of Providence seem to us dark, perplexed, and unaccountable, yet are all wisely ordered for the best. The motion of these wheels was steady, regular, and constant. They went as the Spirit directed, therefore returned not. We should not have to undo that by repentance which we have done amiss, if we followed the guidance of the Spirit. The rings, or rims of the wheels were so vast, that when put in motion the prophet was afraid to look upon them. The consideration of the height and depth of God's counsel should awe us. They were full of eyes round about. The motions of Providence are all directed by infinite Wisdom. All events are determined by the eyes of the Lord, which are in every place beholding the evil and the good; for there is no such thing as chance or fortune. The firmament above was a crystal, glorious, but terribly so. That which we take to be a dark cloud, is to God clear as crystal, through which he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth. When the angels had roused a careless world, they let down their wings, that God's voice might be plainly heard. The voice of Providence is to open men's ears to the voice of the word. Sounds on earth should awaken our attention to the voice from heaven; for how shall we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaks from thence.</body></html>
