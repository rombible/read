<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm" title="Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm" title="O you children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the middle of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appears out of the north, and great destruction.">Jeremiah 6:1</a>), and it was from that direction that the Assyrian and the Chaldaean conquerors were accustomed to descend upon the Holy Land. The vision is actually seen in Chaldaea, but it has reference to Jerusalem, and is described as if viewed from that standpoint.<p><span class= "bld">A great cloud.</span>--As in the Divine manifestation on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/19-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.">Exodus 19:9-16</a>). The cloud serves at once as the groundwork for all the other details of the manifestation--a place in, and by means of which, all are located, and also as a hiding-place of the Divine majesty, so that all may be seen which human eye can bear, and that which it cannot bear may yet be known to be there, shrouded in the cloud. The transposition of a single letter from the end of one word in the Hebrew to the beginning of the next will change the reading to "a whirlwind out of the north brought on a great cloud."<p><span class= "bld">A fire infolding itself.</span>--More literally translated in the margin, <span class= "ital">catching itself. </span>The idea intended to be conveyed is that of flames round and round the cloud, the flashes succeeding one another so rapidly that each seemed to lay hold on the one that had gone before; there were tongues of flame, where each one reached to another. The same word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-24.htm" title="So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.">Exodus 9:24</a>, in connection with "fire," and is there translated <span class= "ital">mingled.</span> The vision thus far seems moulded on the natural appearance of a terrific thunderstorm seen at a distance, in which the great black cloud appears illuminated by the unceasing and coalescing flashes of lightning. So, with all its impressive darkness, "there was a brightness about it."<p><span class= "bld">As the colour of amber.</span>--Colour is, literally, <span class= "ital">eye. </span>The word rendered "amber" (<span class= "ital">chasmal</span>) occurs only in this book (here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-27.htm" title="And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.">Ezekiel 1:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-2.htm" title="Then I beheld, and see a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.">Ezekiel 8:2</a>), and is now generally recognised as meaning some form of bright metal, either glowing in its molten state, or as the "fine brass" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-7.htm" title="And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass.">Ezekiel 1:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm" title="And his feet like to fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.">Revelation 1:15</a>, burnished and glowing in the light of the "infolding flame." There is therefore now superadded to the first appearance of the natural phenomenon, a glowing eye or centre to the cloud, shining out even from the midst of the fire.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A whirlwind came out of the north</span>. What, we ask, was the meaning of this symbolism? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13, 14</a> a like symbol is explained as meaning that the judgments which Judah was to suffer were to come from the north, that is, from Chaldea, upon the prophet's countrymen. Here the prophet is himself in Chaldea, and what he sees is the symbol, not or calamities, but of the Divine glory, and that explanation is, accordingly, inapplicable. Probably the leading thought here is that the Divine presence is no longer in the temple at Jerusalem, It may return for a time to execute judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1, 19, 20</a>), and may again depart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>), but the abiding glory is elsewhere, and the temple is as Shitoh had been of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>). Ezekiel was looking on the visible symbol of what had been declared in unfigurative language by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6, 9</a>). That the north should have been chosen rather than any other quarter of the heavens is perhaps connected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>, where it appears as the region of "fair weather," the unclouded brightness of the "terrible majesty" of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, where "the sides of the north" are the symbols of the dwelling place of God. For the Jews this was probably associated with the thought of the mountain heights of Lebanon as rising up to heaven (Currey, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, in 'Speaker's Commentary'), or with the fact that the "north side" of Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>), as the site of the temple, was the "dwelling place of the great King." Parallels present themselves in the Assyrian hymns that speak of the "feasts of the silver mountains, the heavenly courts" (as the Greeks spoke of Olympus), "where the gods dwell eternally" ('Records of the Past,' 3:133), and this ideal mountain was for them, like the Meru of Indian legend, in the farthest north. So, in the legendary geography of Greece, the Hyperborei, or "people beyond the north," were a holy and blessed race, the chosen servants of Apollo (Herod., 4:32-36: Pindar, 'Pyth.,' 10:4; AEsch., 'Choeph.,' 373). Possibly the brilliant coruscations of an Aurora Borealis may have led men to think of it as they thought of the glory of the dawn or the brightne<span class="accented">ss</span> of the lightning, as a momentary revelation of the higher glory of the throne of God. (For the "whirlwind" as the accompaniment of a Divine revelation, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">A great cloud,</span> etc. So far the signs of the approaching theophany were like those on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 18</a>) and Horeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With a fire infolding itself;</span> the Revised Version margin gives <span class="accented">flashing continually.</span> The Authorized Version suggests the thought of a globe of fire darting its rays through the surrounding darkness. <span class="cmt_word">The colour of amber;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the eye.</span> The Hebrew word for "amber" (chashmal) occurs only here and in ver. 27 and ch. 8:2. It is almost absolutely certain that it does not mean what we know as "amber." The LXX. and Vulgate give <span class="accented">electrum</span>, and this, in later Greek and Latin authors, has "amber" for one of its meanings. Primarily, however, it was used for a metallic substance of some kind, specifically for a compound four parts of gold and one of silver (Pithy, 'Hist. Nat.,' 23:4, s. 23). Some such compound is probably what we have to think of here, and so the description finds a parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>. This, in its ineffable brightness, is seen in the centre of the globe of fire. One may compare Dante's vision of the Divine glory ('Paradise,' 33:55). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.</body></html>
