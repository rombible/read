It is better to keep <span class= "ital">voice </span>throughout. "I heard the voice of their wings, like the voice of many waters." The same comparison is used to describe the voice of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-2.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.">Ezekiel 43:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm" title="And his feet like to fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.">Revelation 1:15</a>. Further attempts to convey an impression of the effect are :--" As the voice of the Almighty," by which thunder is often described in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/37-4.htm" title="After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.">Job 37:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/29-3.htm" title="The voice of the LORD is on the waters: the God of glory thunders: the LORD is on many waters.">Psalm 29:3-4</a>); "the voice of speech," by which is not to be understood articulate language. The word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm" title="The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.">Jeremiah 11:16</a>, and is there translated <span class= "ital">a tumult. </span>The idea conveyed by the word is probably that of the confused sound from a great multitude, and, finally, "as the voice of an host." All these comparisons concur in representing a vast and terrible sound, but inarticulate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The noise of their wings,</span> etc. The wings representing the soaring, ascending elements in nature, their motion answers to its aspirations, their sounds to its inarticulate groanings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>) or its chorus of praise. <span class="cmt_word">The noise of great waters</span> may be that of the sea, or river, or torrents. Ezekiel's use of the term in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-7.htm">Ezekiel 31:7</a>, in connection with the cedars of Lebanon, seems in favour of the last. On the other hand, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, the term is manifestly used for the seas. The thought appears again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-6.htm">Revelation 19:6</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>, the "voice of the Lord" is identified with thunder. <span class="cmt_word">For the</span> <span class="cmt_word">voice of speech,</span> which wrongly suggests articulate utterance, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">a noise of tumult.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-25 Providence, represented by the wheels, produces changes. Sometimes one spoke of the wheel is uppermost, sometimes another; but the motion of the wheel on its own axletree is regular and steady. We need not despond in adversity; the wheels are turning round and will raise us in due time, while those who presume in prosperity know not how soon they may be cast down. The wheel is near the living creatures; the angels are employed as ministers of God's providence. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels; the same wisdom, power, and holiness of God, that guide and govern the angels, by them order all events in this lower world. The wheel had four faces, denoting that the providence of God exerts itself in all parts. Look every way upon the wheel of providence, it has a face toward you. Their appearance and work were as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. The disposals of Providence seem to us dark, perplexed, and unaccountable, yet are all wisely ordered for the best. The motion of these wheels was steady, regular, and constant. They went as the Spirit directed, therefore returned not. We should not have to undo that by repentance which we have done amiss, if we followed the guidance of the Spirit. The rings, or rims of the wheels were so vast, that when put in motion the prophet was afraid to look upon them. The consideration of the height and depth of God's counsel should awe us. They were full of eyes round about. The motions of Providence are all directed by infinite Wisdom. All events are determined by the eyes of the Lord, which are in every place beholding the evil and the good; for there is no such thing as chance or fortune. The firmament above was a crystal, glorious, but terribly so. That which we take to be a dark cloud, is to God clear as crystal, through which he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth. When the angels had roused a careless world, they let down their wings, that God's voice might be plainly heard. The voice of Providence is to open men's ears to the voice of the word. Sounds on earth should awaken our attention to the voice from heaven; for how shall we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaks from thence.</body></html>
