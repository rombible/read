Of course, such a wheel would be impossible of mechanical construction; it is only seen in vision and as a symbol; it was never intended to be actually made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like unto the colour of a beryl.</span> The Hebrew for "beryl" (<span class="accented">tarshish</span>) suggests that the stone was called, like the turquoise, from the region which produced it. Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a> the LXX. leaves it untranslated. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a> we find <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-9.htm">Ezekiel 10:9</a> and Ezekiel 28:13 <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> carbuncle. It is obvious, from this variety of renderings, that the stone was not easily identified. Probably it was of a red or golden color, suggesting the thought of fire rather than the pale green of the aquamarine or beryl (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They four had one likeness,</span> etc. A closer gaze led the prophet to see that there was a plurality in the unity. For the one "wheel" we have four; perhaps, as some have thought, two wheels intersecting at right angles, perhaps, one, probably seen behind, perhaps also below, each of the living creatures. They are not said actually to rest upon it, and the word "chariot" is not used as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-18.htm">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>. They would seem rather to have hovered over the wheels, moving simultaneously and in full accord with them. The "wheels" obviously represent the forces and laws that sustain the manifold forms of life represented by the "living creatures" and the "Spirit." In each case the number four is, as elsewhere, the symbol of completeness. <span class="cmt_word">A wheel in the midst of</span> (<span class="accented">within</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">a wheel;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with an inner and outer circumference, the space between the two forming the "ring" or felloe of ver. 18. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-25 Providence, represented by the wheels, produces changes. Sometimes one spoke of the wheel is uppermost, sometimes another; but the motion of the wheel on its own axletree is regular and steady. We need not despond in adversity; the wheels are turning round and will raise us in due time, while those who presume in prosperity know not how soon they may be cast down. The wheel is near the living creatures; the angels are employed as ministers of God's providence. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels; the same wisdom, power, and holiness of God, that guide and govern the angels, by them order all events in this lower world. The wheel had four faces, denoting that the providence of God exerts itself in all parts. Look every way upon the wheel of providence, it has a face toward you. Their appearance and work were as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. The disposals of Providence seem to us dark, perplexed, and unaccountable, yet are all wisely ordered for the best. The motion of these wheels was steady, regular, and constant. They went as the Spirit directed, therefore returned not. We should not have to undo that by repentance which we have done amiss, if we followed the guidance of the Spirit. The rings, or rims of the wheels were so vast, that when put in motion the prophet was afraid to look upon them. The consideration of the height and depth of God's counsel should awe us. They were full of eyes round about. The motions of Providence are all directed by infinite Wisdom. All events are determined by the eyes of the Lord, which are in every place beholding the evil and the good; for there is no such thing as chance or fortune. The firmament above was a crystal, glorious, but terribly so. That which we take to be a dark cloud, is to God clear as crystal, through which he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth. When the angels had roused a careless world, they let down their wings, that God's voice might be plainly heard. The voice of Providence is to open men's ears to the voice of the word. Sounds on earth should awaken our attention to the voice from heaven; for how shall we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaks from thence.</body></html>
