The word "lamps" does not refer to the material, but to the light, and whether in the Hebrew or in its Greek equivalent, is translated by <span class= "ital">torches </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm" title="The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightning.">Nahum 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-3.htm" title="Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.">John 18:3</a>),<span class= "ital">firebrands </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-4.htm" title="And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the middle between two tails.">Judges 15:4</a>), or <span class= "ital">lightnings </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm" title="And all the people saw the thunder, and the lightning, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.">Exodus 20:18</a>). Ezekiel could find no single word to express his meaning, and has therefore given two, that between them the idea of the fiery brilliancy may be better conveyed.<p><span class= "bld">It went up and down.</span>--" It" refers to the fire. This indescribable fiery appearance went up and down among the living creatures, "bright" in itself, and throwing out coruscations of "lightning."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like burning coals of fire, etc</span>. It may not be amiss to note the fact that the phrase throughout the Bible denotes incandescent wood. The nearest approach to its use by Ezekiel is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-9.htm">2 Samuel 22:9, 13</a>. For "lamps," read, with the Revised Version, "torches." Here the vision of Ezekiel, in which the living creatures were thus incandescent, bathed, as it were, in the fire that played around them, yet not consumed, followed in the path of previous symbols - of the burning bush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>), of the pillar of fire by night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-22.htm">Exodus 13:22</a>), of the fire on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), of the "fire of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>), and the "fire of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-12.htm">2 Kings 1:12</a>). Speaking generally, "fire," as distinct from "light," seems to be the symbol of the power of God as manifested against evil. "Our God is a consuming Fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). The red light of fire has in it an element of terror which is absent from the stainless white of the eternal glory, or from the sapphire of the visible firmament. <span class="cmt_word">Lightning</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.</body></html>
