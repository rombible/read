The word "likeness" is not without significance. The prophet would make it plain that this was a vision, that these were symbolic, not actually existing creatures. Their prominent characteristic is that they were "living." This word is used over and over again in connection with them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/1-13.htm" title="As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.">Ezekiel 1:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-19.htm" title="And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.">Ezekiel 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-21.htm" title="When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.">Ezekiel 1:21</a>, &c.); and in fact, in Ezekiel and Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm" title="And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.">Ezekiel 4:6</a>, &c., where it is mis-translated <span class= "ital">beasts</span>) it occurs nearly thirty times. The same characteristic is further emphasized in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-14.htm" title="And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.">Ezekiel 1:14</a> by the speed, "as of a flash of lightning," with which they "ran and returned," by the multiplicity of eyes in the wheels connected with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm" title="As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.">Ezekiel 1:18</a>), and by their going instantly "whithersoever the spirit was to go" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-20.htm" title="Wherever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.">Ezekiel 1:20</a>); while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a> it is said that "they rest not day and night." Their life is represented as most closely connected with the source of all life, the "living God," whose throne is seen in the vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a>) as above the heads of these "living creatures,"<p>Ezekiel does not here say what these living creatures were, but in a subsequent vision, when he saw them again in connection with the Temple, he recognised them as the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-20.htm" title="This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:20</a>). Cherubim, whether here, or in the Temple overshadowing the mercy-seat, or in the garden of Eden keeping the way of the tree of life, always indicate the immediate presence of the God of holiness. The prophet again mentions these composite symbolic figures in connection with the vision of the Temple in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/41-18.htm" title="And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;">Ezekiel 41:18-20</a>. The origin of such ideal figures has been variously ascribed to the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Ph?nicians, and the Arabs; but this symbolism was, in fact, almost universal throughout the East. Dr. Currey (<span class= "ital">Speaker's Com., </span>note on Ezekiel 1) points out the striking difference between this symbolism and that of the Greeks. They tried to delineate the Divine attributes with the utmost beauty of form and harmony of detail under some human figure in which those attributes were conspicuous. In consequence, the mind of the worshipper lost sight of the ideal, and became absorbed in the sensuous imagery by which it was represented; while here, by the very strangeness, and sometimes grotesqueness, of the imagery, its purely symbolic character was kept constantly in view. Cherubim are associated in the Old Testament with that tree of life of which man might not partake save through Him who is "the life," and with that typical holy of holies which man might not enter until the true Holy of Holies was entered once for all by Christ through His own blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">They had the likeness of a man.</span>--With all the strange variety of details to be described immediately, they had yet a general human form, and are to be understood as like man in whatever is not specified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The likeness of four living creatures.</span> The Authorized Version is happier here in its rendering than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, where we find "beasts" applied to the analogues of the forms of Ezekiel's vision. There the Greek gives <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>, as the LXX. does here, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3-7</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15</a> they are identified with the "cherubim" of the mercy seat; but the fact that they are not so named here is presumptive evidence that Ezekiel did not at first recognize them as identical with what he had heard of those cherubim, or with the other like forms that were seen, as they were <span class="accented">not</span> seen, in the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-29.htm">1 Kings 7:29</a>), on its walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-7.htm">2 Chronicles 3:7</a>), and on its veil or curtain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-35.htm">Exodus 36:35</a>). What he sees is, in fact, a highly complicated development of the cherubic symbols, which might well appear strange to him. It is possible (as Dean Stanley and others have suggested) that the Assyrian and Babylonian sculptures, the winged bulls and lions with human heads, which Ezekiel may have seen in his exile, were elements in that development. <span class="cmt_word">The likeness of a man.</span> This apparently was the first impression. The "living creatures" were not, like the Assyrian forms just referred to, quadrupeds. They stood erect, and had feet and hands as men have. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.</body></html>
