In the original there is simply the ordinary form of the repetition of the verb for the sake of emphasis. The prophet mentions his own name only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-24.htm" title="Thus Ezekiel is to you a sign: according to all that he has done shall you do: and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 24:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The hand of the Lord was there upon him.</span>--A form of expression to indicate that special power and influence which the Spirit exercised over the prophets at times when they were called to become the means of the Divine communications. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.">1Kings 18:46</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.">Ezekiel 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-1.htm" title="The hand of the LORD was on me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the middle of the valley which was full of bones,">Ezekiel 37:1</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm" title="Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.">Daniel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-10.htm" title="And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.">Daniel 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:">Revelation 1:17</a>.) It is noticeable that Ezekiel here speaks of himself in the third person, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.">Ezekiel 1:1</a>, and always after this, he uses the first person. It had been suggested that this, together with the mention of his own name, may indicate the insertion of these two verses on a revision of his work by the prophet.<p>In entering upon the vision of the glory of the Lord, which fills the rest of this chapter, it is to be remembered that Ezekiel is struggling to portray that which necessarily exceeds the power of human language; it is not therefore surprising that there should be something of repetition and of obscurity in the detail. All similar descriptions of Divine manifestations are marked more or less strongly by the same characteristics. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-9.htm" title="Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:">Exodus 24:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-12.htm" title="And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 1:12-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/4-2.htm" title="And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.">Revelation 4:2-6</a>, &c.) It is also to be borne in mind that what the prophet saw was not the eternal Father in His own absolute essence, who dwells in unapproachable light, and whom "no man hath seen, nor can see" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1Timothy 6:16</a>); and had it been possible that Ezekiel should have been so transported out of the body as to behold this, it would then have been impossible for him to describe it. But what he saw in vision was such manifestation as man could bear, in which God hides His face, and allows to be seen only His uttermost parts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:">Exodus 33:22-23</a>). In the description that follows may be recognised a mingling of the symbols of the Divine manifestation at Sinai with the "patterns of heavenly things" in the most holy place of the Temple, the whole modified to suit the present occasion, and possibly somewhat coloured by the now familiar symbolic art of Babylonia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord came expressly,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">coming, there come the word of the Lord</span>; the iteration having (as commonly in this combination in Hebrew) the force of emphasis. The phrase stands, as elsewhere, for the conscious inspiration which made men feel that Jehovah had indeed spoken unto them, and that they had a message from him to deliver. To give parallel passages would be to copy several pages from a concordance, but it may not be without interest to note its first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>) and last (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-1.htm">Malachi 1:1</a>) occurrences in the Old Testament, and its reappearance in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-2.htm">Luke 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto Ezekiel.</span> We note the transition from the first person to the third; but it does not give sufficient ground for rejecting either ver. 1 or ver. 2, 3 as an interpolation. (For the prophet's name, which appears only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-24.htm">Ezekiel 24:24</a>, see Introduction; and for "land of Chaldeans," note on ver. 1.) <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the Lord.</span> Here again we haw a phrase of frequent occurrence, used of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>), of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>), of Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10</a>), of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>), of St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). The "hand" of the Lord is the natural symbol of his power, and the phrase seems to be used to add to the consciousness of inspiration, that of a constraining, irresistible power. Ezekiel continually uses it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.</body></html>
