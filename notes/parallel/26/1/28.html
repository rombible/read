The addition, "in the day of rain," is not merely a reference to the ordinary natural phenomenon, but distinctly connects this vision with the gracious promise in Genesis, and shows that God, who has in this vision presented His attributes of terrible majesty, will add to them also those of mercy and loving-kindness. It was in both alike that He was to be made known to His people through the prophet who is now receiving his commission.

Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-37.htm" title="Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about sought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.">Luke 8:37</a>.)<p>In considering the general significance of this vision, it is to be remembered that it was seen four times by Ezekiel in various connections in his life-work. First, at this time, when he is called to the exercise of the prophetic office; a second time when, shortly afterwards, he is sent to denounce judgments upon the sinful people, and to foretell the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-23.htm" title="Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.">Ezekiel 3:23</a>, &c.); again, a year and a half later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15</a>), he sees the same vision, while he is made to understand the evils and abominations wrought in the Temple (which is still standing), until the "glory of the Lord" forsakes His house and departs from the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.">Ezekiel 11:23</a>), in token that God had given them over to punishment; finally, in the prophecy of future restoration and blessing, he again sees the presence of the Lord, by means of the same vision, re-enter and fill the house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/43-3.htm" title="And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.">Ezekiel 43:3-5</a>). Its meaning, therefore, clearly relates to the whole prophecies of Ezekiel, whether of judgment or mercy; and, without attempting an explanation of the symbolism in detail, we cannot be wrong in assuming that it represents the resistless Divine activity, controlling alike the agencies of judgment and of mercy, directed to every corner of the earth, and requiring of all profoundest homage and veneration. The perfect unity of purpose in all God's doings is made especially prominent, and the consistency of His wrath with His love, of His judgments with His mercy; while over all seems to be written, as on the plate of the mitre which He had of old commanded the high priest to wear in His temple, "Holiness unto the Lord."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the appearance of the bow.</span> The glorious epiphany was completed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a> and Revelation 10:1, by the appearance of the rainbow. The symbol of God's faithfulness, and of the hope that rested on it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>). was seen in the glory of the Divine perfection, even in the midst of the fire of the Divine wrath. Mercy and love are thought of as over arching all the phenomena of the world and its history, attempering the chastisements which are needed for those with whom that love is dealing. The whole complex appearances of Ezekiel's descriptions, including the arch of prismatic colours, finds its nearest natural analogue, as has been before suggested (note on ver. 4), in the phenomena of the Northern Lights. <span class="cmt_word">I fell upon my face.</span> As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>, the prostrate attitude of lowliest adoration, the dread and awe of one who has seen the King, the Lord of hosts, and vet survives, was a preparation for the more direct revelation to his consciousness of the Word and will of Jehovah (comp. Dante 'Inferno,' 3:136; 5:142). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-28 The eternal Son, the second Person in the Trinity, who afterwards took the human nature, is here denoted. The first thing observed was a throne. It is a throne of glory, a throne of grace, a throne of triumph, a throne of government, a throne of judgment. It is good news to men, that the throne above the firmament is filled with One who appears, even there, in the likeness of a man. The throne is surrounded with a rainbow, the well-known emblem of the covenant, representing God's mercy and covenanted love to his people. The fire of God's wrath was breaking out against Jerusalem, but bounds should be set to it; he would look upon the bow, and remember the covenant. All the prophet saw was only to prepare him for what he was to hear. When he fell on his face, he heard the voice of One that spake. God delights to teach the humble. Let sinners, then, humble themselves before him. And let believers think upon his glory, that they may be gradually changed into his image by the Spirit of the Lord.</body></html>
