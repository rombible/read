The number is plainly not important, though doubtless assigned to them with reference to the number of creatures, and of their faces, and of the wheels; but that they should have more than the normal number of two is here appropriate, partly to concur with the other indications of the fulness of their life and activity, and partly because (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm" title="Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.">Ezekiel 1:11</a>) two of them were used to express their reverence, as were four of those of the seraphim in Isaiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - We note the points of contrast with other like visions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> each seraph has six wings, as each "living creature" has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a> the four heads are distributed, one to each of the "living creatures," while here each has four faces, and forms, as it were, a <span class="accented">Janus quadrifrons.</span> The wings are described more minutely in ver. 11. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.</body></html>
