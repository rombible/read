It is always the tendency of sinful man to take this ground while experiencing the long-suffering and forbearance of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm" title="Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-3.htm" title="You that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;">Amos 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1Thessalonians 5:3</a>); and the scoff, "Where is the promise of His coming?" will still continue to the end of time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>). In this case, the objection was evidently encouraged by false prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm" title="For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 12:24</a>), and accordingly the following chapter is devoted to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:21-28 From that forbearance of God, which should have led them to repent, the Jews hardened themselves in sin. It will not serve for an excuse in speaking evil, to plead that it is a common saying. There is but a step between us and an awful eternity; therefore it concerns us to get ready for a future state. No one will be able to put from himself the evil day, unless by seeking peace with the Lord.</body></html>
