but Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm" title="Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.">Jeremiah 52:11</a>) makes it plain by recording that Zedekiah's eyes were put out in Riblah, before he was carried to Babylon. Josephus has a curious story (<span class= "ital">Antiq. </span>x. 7, ? 2), that Zedekiah was inclined to believe the warnings of Jeremiah that he should be carried captive to Babylon; but when Ezekiel sent this prophecy to Jerusalem, saying that he should not see the land, he conceived the two prophecies to be contradictory, and so disbelieved them both. Zedekiah's death in Babylon is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm" title="Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.">Jeremiah 52:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My net also will I spread,</span> etc. Compare the same image in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>. The prediction of ver. 12 is reiterated with emphasis. Zedekiah shall be in Babylon, yet shall not see. Josephus ('Ant.,' 10. 7:2; 8:2) relates that Ezekiel sent this prophecy to Jerusalem, and that Zedekiah, finding an apparent discrepancy in the words that he should not see Babylon, and those of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>), hardened himself in his unbelief. There is no reason, however, for supposing that Josephus had access to any other records than the books of the two prophets, and his narrative looks rather like an imagined history of what might have been. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 By the preparation for removal, and his breaking through the wall of his house at evening, as one desirous to escape from the enemy, the prophet signified the conduct and fate of Zedekiah. When God has delivered us, we must glorify him and edify others, by acknowledging our sins. Those who by afflictions are brought to this, are made to know that God is the Lord, and may help to bring others to know him.</body></html>
