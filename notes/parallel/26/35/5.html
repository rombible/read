The time specifically referred to is that of the overthrow of Jerusalem, as both that of their great "calamity" and that when "their iniquity had an end." (On the last phrase, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-29.htm" title="Whiles they see vanity to you, whiles they divine a lie to you, to bring you on the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.">Ezekiel 21:29</a>.) So the world-power generally, while it may fawn upon and corrupt the Church in the day of its prosperity, shows its undisguised hostility in every time of adversity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred</span>; literally, <span class="accented">hatred of</span> old, or eternal enmity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>). This was the first of the two specific grounds upon which Eden should feel the stroke of Divine vengeance. Edom had been Israel's hereditary foe from the days of Esau and Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-22.htm">Genesis 25:22</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; and Genesis 27:37) downwards. Inspired with unappeasable wrath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>), during the period of the wandering he had refused Israel, "his brother," a passage through his territory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a>), and in the days of Jehoshaphat had combined with Ammon and Moab to invade Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10, 11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-1.htm">Psalm 83:1-8</a>). His relentless antipathy to Israel culminated, according to Ezekiel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>), in the last days of <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem, in the time of her calamity</span>, when Nebuchadnezzar's armies encompassed her walls, in the time that her <span class="cmt_word">iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">had an end</span>; or, in <span class="accented">the time of the iniquity of the end</span> (Revised Version); meaning, according to Keil, "the time of Judah's final transgression;" or, according to Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' the time when the capture of the city put an end to her iniquity; but, with more probability, according to Hengstenberg, Plumptre, and others, the time of that iniquity which brought on her end (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-29.htm">Ezekiel 21:29</a>). Ewald translates, "at the time of her extremest punishment," taking <span class="accented">avon</span> in the sense of punishment - a rendering the Revisers have placed in the margin. Then, according to Obadiah (vers. 11-14), the Edomites had not only stood coolly by, but malevolently exulted when they beheld Jerusalem besieged by the Babylonian warriors; and not only joined with the foreign invaders in the sacking of the city, but occupied its gates and guarded the roads leading into the country, so as to prevent the escape of any of the wretched inhabitants, and even hewed down with the sword such fugitives as they were not able to save alive and deliver up to captivity. To this Ezekiel refers when he accuses Edom of having <span class="cmt_word">shed</span> the <span class="cmt_word">blood of the children of Israel</span> by the fores of the sword; literally, of having <span class="accented">poured the children of Israel upon the hands of the sword; i.e.</span> of having delivered them up to the sword (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-9 All who have God against them, have the word of God against them. Those that have a constant hatred to God and his people, as the carnal mind has, can only expect to be made desolate for ever.</body></html>
