The land included the whole mountainous region between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic Gulf, or eastern branch of the Red Sea. The earlier denunciation of the Edomites had in view their historical relations to Israel; this, on the other hand, as already said--like Isaiah 34; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>--while still keeping this historical relation in view, regards them also as representative of the world's hostility to the covenant people of God. This appears from the fact that the desolation of Edom, itself but a small province, is put in contrast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-14.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.">Ezekiel 35:14</a>) with the rejoicing of the whole earth, and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-5.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.">Ezekiel 36:5</a> (and generally <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/35-3.htm" title="And say to it, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against you, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you most desolate.">Ezekiel 35:3-7</a>) Edom is coupled with "the residue of the heathen." For the phrase "set thy face against," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-17.htm" title="Likewise, you son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy you against them,">Ezekiel 13:17</a>; and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm" title="And say to it, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against you, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you most desolate.">Ezekiel 35:3</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm" title="So will I stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 6:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thy face against Mount Seir.</span> The mountainous are in between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic Gulf, which formed the original settlement of Esau and his descendants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-9.htm">Genesis 36:9</a>), is here put for the land of Edom, as the land in turn stands for its people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-8.htm">Ezekiel 25:8</a>). Although already the prophet has pronounced a threatening doom against Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-14</a>), he once more directs against, it the judgments of Heaven, on this occasion viewing it as the representative of all those hostile world-powers which from the first had been opposed to Israel as the theocratic nation, and which even then, by their antagonism, hindered her return (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-9 All who have God against them, have the word of God against them.
