But here, as everywhere, it is to be remembered that the description is ideal<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - The remaining portions of the terumah should be two strips of land, each 10,000 &times; 5000 reeds, one on each side of the city, the <span class="cmt_word">increase</span> or produce of which should be <span class="cmt_word">for food unto them that serve the city.</span> By "them that serve the city" Hitzig and Smend understand its ordinary inhabitants, since a district may be said to be cultivated through simple residence upon it (compare <span class="accented">colere locum</span>). Havernick, after Gesenius, thinks of the workmen who should be employed in building the city, against which may be urged that the city is supposed to be already built. Hengstenberg, with whom Plumptre seems disposed to agree, can only see in the city servers "a militia who take the city in the midst." Keil and Kliefoth find them in the laboring classes, who should not in this future state, as so often in ordinary states among men, be destitute of a possession in land, but should receive an allotment for their maintenance. But an obvious objection to this view is that it hands over the city land exclusively to the laboring classes, <span class="accented">forgetting</span> that the "other" classes require support as well as they. Probably the best interpretation is to regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, "them that serve the city," as standing in antithesis to the other two classes already mentioned - the Levites, whose office should be to serve the tabernacle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> is employed to denote the service of the Levites); and the priests, whose special function should be to serve the altar (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>, in which, again, the same verb is used). Thus regarded, "they that serve the city" will mean all engaged in secular pursuits in the city, which approximates to the view of Hitzig; and the prophet's language will signify that all such should derive their sustenance from the city lands, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> should either have direct access to these lands to cultivate them for themselves, or should obtain a share in the produce of these lands for other services rendered to the city. With this accords the further statement that those who served the city should serve it <span class="cmt_word">out of all the tribes of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its inhabitants should not, as formerly, be drawn chiefly from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, but contain representatives from all the tribes of Israel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-35 Here is a description of the several portions of the land belonging to each tribe. In gospel times, behold all things are become new. Much is wrapped up in emblems and numbers. This method God has used to state mysterious truths in his word, not to be more clearly revealed till the proper time and season. But into the church of Christ, both in its state of warfare and triumph, there is free access by faith, from every side. Christ has opened the kingdom of heaven for all believers. Whoever will, may come, and take of the water of life, of the tree of life, freely. The Lord is there, in his church, to be nigh unto them in all they call upon him for. This is true of every real Christian; whatever soul has in it a living principle of grace, it may truly be said, The Lord is there. May we be found citizens of this holy city, and act agreeably to that character; and have the benefit of the Lord's presence with us, in life, in death, and for evermore.</body></html>
