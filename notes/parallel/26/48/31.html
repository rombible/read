These should be twelve in number, three on each side, and named after the twelve tribes (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>). The gates leading northward should be those of Reuben, Judah, and Levi, all children of Leah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32, 35</a>), as Keil observes, "the firstborn in age, the firstborn by virtue of the patriarchal blessing, and the one chosen by Jehovah for his own service in the place of the firstborn." The same three occupy the first three places and in the same order in the blessing of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6-8</a>). Towards the east should lead the gates of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan, the first and second sons of Rachel, and the third a son of Rachel's handmaid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm">Genesis 35:18</a>). In the blessing of Moses Benjamin precedes Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12, 13</a>). The south gates receive the names of Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun, again all sons of Leah. The west gates are those of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, that is, two sons of Leah's handmaid and one of Rachel's. It is observable that in the naming of the gates Levi resumes his place among the tribes, which necessitates the substitution of Joseph the original tribe-father instead of Ephraim and Manasseh his two sons. (On the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">one gate of Judah</span>, literally, <span class="accented">the gate of Judah one</span>, see on ver. 1.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-35 Here is a description of the several portions of the land belonging to each tribe. In gospel times, behold all things are become new. Much is wrapped up in emblems and numbers. This method God has used to state mysterious truths in his word, not to be more clearly revealed till the proper time and season. But into the church of Christ, both in its state of warfare and triumph, there is free access by faith, from every side. Christ has opened the kingdom of heaven for all believers. Whoever will, may come, and take of the water of life, of the tree of life, freely. The Lord is there, in his church, to be nigh unto them in all they call upon him for. This is true of every real Christian; whatever soul has in it a living principle of grace, it may truly be said, The Lord is there. May we be found citizens of this holy city, and act agreeably to that character; and have the benefit of the Lord's presence with us, in life, in death, and for evermore.</body></html>
