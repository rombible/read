Beginning at the north, a portion is assigned to each of seven tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/48-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goes to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.">Ezekiel 48:1-7</a>); then the "oblation" is described, with its parts for the Levites, the priests and Temple, the city and those that serve it, and for the prince (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>), and lastly portions for the remaining five tribes. The chapter and the book close with an account of the size and the twelve gates of the city, the whole ending with its name, "The Lord is there."<p>The distribution of the land is entirely different from that made under Joshua, nor is it easy to trace any historical reasons for it, except that the central portion, containing the Temple, the land of the priests and the prince, is flanked by the two tribes of the southern kingdom, Judah and Benjamin. The chapter can best be understood by the aid of a small map, the outline of which is traced from Dr. Wm. Smith's ancient atlas. This might be drawn with the lines between the tribes perpendicular either to the general course of the Jordan, or to the general coast-line of the Mediterranean. The latter would give a little more width for the oblation, but still not enough, and would leave no space at all on the west for the prince. The former arrangement is on the whole preferred. It will be seen that the tribes are not arranged either according to their seniority or their maternity. The territory falling to each tribe was much smaller than of old, partly because of the large space occupied by the "oblation" (fully one-fifth of the whole), and partly because the remainder was to be divided among the whole twelve tribes, instead of among only nine and a half. The portion thus given to each tribe was rather less than two-thirds that assigned, on the average, by Joshua.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">These are his sides east and west.</span>--<span class= "ital">Lit., The east side, the west side, shall be to him,</span> meaning that the portion of Dan stretches across the country from the eastern to the western boundary. So of them all. The original portion of Dan was at the west of Benjamin, but a part of the tribe having conquered Laish, and settled at the extreme north, Dan is now made the most northern of the tribes. Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, and Ephraim are so far approximated to their old places as to be north of the sanctuary.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">In length as one of the other parts.--</span>The oblation, which has been already spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/45-1.htm" title="Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.">Ezekiel 45:1-7</a> in a different connection, is here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>) more exactly described. Its whole width is again stated as 25,000 reeds, and its length from the eastern to the western boundaries of the laud "as one of the other parts," no account being taken in this of the varying distance between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. It cannot, however, be so placed as not to exceed that distance.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">The oblation.--</span>This is the same word as is translated <span class= "ital">offering</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8</a>. It is used in this passage in three different senses:--(1) as including the whole strip from the Jordan to the Mediterranean and 25,000 reeds wide; (2) for that part of this set aside for the priests, and for the Levites; (3) for the most sacred part of this, appropriated to the priests and Temple, 25,000 reeds from east to west, and 10,000 from north to south. This last portion, although in the middle, is mentioned first on account of its especial sacredness.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">In the midst thereof.--</span>The whole connection shows that this is <span class= "ital">to</span> be understood strictly; the sanctuary was to be not merely within the priests' portion, but in its centre.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Sons of Zadok.--</span>See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-46.htm" title="And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister to him.">Ezekiel 40:46</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As the Levites went astray</span>.--That the Levites were far more affected than the priests by the general apostasy, may be reasonably inferred from the fact that at the restoration less than 400 Levites, and as many Nethinims, returned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/2-40.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.">Ezra 2:40-58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/7-43.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the children of Hodevah, seventy and four.">Nehemiah 7:43-60</a>), while there were 4,289 of the priests.<p>MAP OF PALESTINE,<p>Showing the Divisions among the Tribes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-29.</span> - The <span class="accented">distribution of the land among the several tribes</span>. First, the portions north of the terumah (vers. 1-7); secondly, the terumah (vers. 8-22), embracing the portions of the priests and Levites (vers. 8-14), with the portions for the city (vers. 15-20) and the prince (vers. 21, 22); and thirdly, the portions south of the city (vers. 23-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">portions north of the terumah</span>. These should be seven, lie in parallel strips from the Mediterranean to the east border, and be allocated to the tribes of Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, and. Judah. The divergences between this and the earlier division under Joshua (14-19.) are apparent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In that Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh received portions on the east of Jordan; in this no tribe obtains a lot outside of the boundary of the Holy Land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In that the allocation commenced in the south with Judah; in this it begins in the north with Dan (for the reason, see Exposition). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In that the most northern portions, those of Asher and Naphtali, started from a point a little above Tyre; in this the most northern portion, that of Dan, proceeds from the entering in or the south border of Hamath, some fifty or sixty miles north of Damascus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> In that the portions were scarcely ever parallel; in this they always are. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> In that the portions of Judah and Reuben lay south, and that of Dan west of Jerusalem; in this all three are situated north of the city. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The names of the tribes</span>. The tribe of Levi Being excepted, the number twelve should in the future as in the past division of the holy soil be preserved by assigning to Joseph portions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>), one for Ephraim and one for Manasseh. <span class="cmt_word">From the north end</span>. On the former occasion the allotment had begun in the south of the land and proceeded northwards; on this it should commence in the north and move regularly southward. The alteration is sufficiently explained by remembering that, after the conquest, the people were viewed as having come from the south, whereas at the restoration they should appear as entering in from the north. <span class="cmt_word">To the coast of</span> (better, <span class="accented">beside</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to</span> (literally, to the <span class="accented">entering in of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hamath, Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus.</span> This was the north boundary of the land from west to east, as already defined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16, 17</a>); and with this line the portion of Dan should begin. The portion should then, as to situation, be one lying <span class="cmt_word">northwards, to the coast of</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">beside</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hamath.</span> That is to say, beginning with the border of Hamath, it should extend southwards. <span class="cmt_word">For these are his sides, east and west</span> should be, And <span class="accented">there shall be to him sides east</span>, <span class="accented">west</span>, meaning "the tract between both eastern and western boundaries," rather than as Hitzig translates, "And there shall be to him the east side of the sea," signifying that his territory should embrace the land east of the Mediterranean;" or as Hengstenberg renders, And they shall be to him the east side the sea," equal to "the tract in question should have the sea for its east border." Then, as this applies equally to all the tribe-portions, Hengstenberg regards "to him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>) as pointing to "the whole of the tribes combined into an ideal unity," but expositors generally agree that "to him" should be referred to Dan, whom the prophet had in mind and was about to mention. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> portion for <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span> should be <span class="accented">Dan one</span> "portion," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>), rather than "tribe," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>, as Smend proposes. To take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> as alluding to the enumeration of the tribes is indeed countenanced by Ezekiel's mode of numbering the gates (vers. 30-35); but Ezekiel's style in vers. 30-35 will be preserved here also if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> precede "Judah," thus: "the portion of Danone." "The presupposition that one tribe should receive exactly as much as another led to the individual tribe's portion being considered as a <span class="accented">mona</span>s" (Kliefoth). In the first division of the land, Dan's portion was small, and situated west of the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-35 Here is a description of the several portions of the land belonging to each tribe. In gospel times, behold all things are become new. Much is wrapped up in emblems and numbers. This method God has used to state mysterious truths in his word, not to be more clearly revealed till the proper time and season. But into the church of Christ, both in its state of warfare and triumph, there is free access by faith, from every side. Christ has opened the kingdom of heaven for all believers. Whoever will, may come, and take of the water of life, of the tree of life, freely. The Lord is there, in his church, to be nigh unto them in all they call upon him for. This is true of every real Christian; whatever soul has in it a living principle of grace, it may truly be said, The Lord is there. May we be found citizens of this holy city, and act agreeably to that character; and have the benefit of the Lord's presence with us, in life, in death, and for evermore.</body></html>
