Also the future tenses throughout the verse should be rendered as present, in accordance with this character of a general statement: "When a land sinneth . . . and I stretch out<span class= "bld"> . . .</span> and break the staff<span class= "bld"> . . .</span> and send famine<span class= "bld"> . . .</span> and cut off." The particular judgment of famine was threatened in the warnings of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm" title="And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/28-38.htm" title="You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.">Deuteronomy 28:38-40</a>), and also, in immediate connection with it, all the other woes here mentioned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:12-23 National sins bring national judgments. Though sinners escape one judgment, another is waiting for them. When God's professing people rebel against him, they may justly expect all his judgments. The faith, obedience, and prayers of Noah prevailed to the saving of his house, but not of the old world. Job's sacrifice and prayer in behalf of his friends were accepted, and Daniel had prevailed for the saving his companions and the wise men of Babylon. But a people that had filled the measure of their sins, was not to expect to escape for the sake of any righteous men living among them; not even of the most eminent saints, who could be accepted in their own case only through the sufferings and righteousness of Christ. Yet even when God makes the greatest desolations by his judgments, he saves some to be monuments of his mercy. In firm belief that we shall approve the whole of God's dealings with ourselves, and with all mankind, let us silence all rebellious murmurs and objections.</body></html>
