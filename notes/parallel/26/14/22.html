and it is clearly implied that they shall come to Babylonia. There the present exiles shall see them, and thus be comforted. But in what sense comforted? The connection absolutely decides this: "when ye see their ways and their doings, ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it." That is, when you see the wickedness, of this remnant, you will cease to mourn over the judgment, for you cannot but perceive that it was a righteous act of God. The expression "sons and daughters" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm" title="Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.">Ezekiel 14:22</a> with reference to the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-16.htm" title="Though these three men were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.">Ezekiel 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-18.htm" title="Though these three men were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.">Ezekiel 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-20.htm" title="Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.">Ezekiel 14:20</a>; and the form "they shall comfort you" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm" title="And they shall comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings: and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 14:23</a> is explained by what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm" title="Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.">Ezekiel 14:22</a>, not as meaning "they shall administer comfort," but "they shall be a cause of comfort" by showing you their exceeding wickedness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The words end with a gleam of hope shining through the judgments. For Ezekiel, as for Isaiah, there is the thought of a "remnant that shall return" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). It has been questioned whether "the ways and the doings" which are to bring comfort to men's minds are those of the evil past or of the subsequent repentance. I incline to the view that they include both. Men should see at once the severity and the goodness of Jehovah. His punishments had not been arbitrary nor excessive. They had also been as a discipline leading men to repentance. In each of those facts there was a ground of comfort for men who asked the question, which Abraham asked of old, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). In either aspect men will recognize that God has not done without cause all that he has done. In this way the prophet seeks, as others have done since, to justify the ways of God to man. Ezekiel's word for "remnant" is, it may be noted, not the same as Isaiah's, its primary significance being "these that <span class="accented">escape</span>." Ezekiel does not quote the earlier prophet, though his thoughts are in harmony with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:12-23 National sins bring national judgments. Though sinners escape one judgment, another is waiting for them. When God's professing people rebel against him, they may justly expect all his judgments. The faith, obedience, and prayers of Noah prevailed to the saving of his house, but not of the old world. Job's sacrifice and prayer in behalf of his friends were accepted, and Daniel had prevailed for the saving his companions and the wise men of Babylon. But a people that had filled the measure of their sins, was not to expect to escape for the sake of any righteous men living among them; not even of the most eminent saints, who could be accepted in their own case only through the sufferings and righteousness of Christ. Yet even when God makes the greatest desolations by his judgments, he saves some to be monuments of his mercy. In firm belief that we shall approve the whole of God's dealings with ourselves, and with all mankind, let us silence all rebellious murmurs and objections.</body></html>
