Israel is now becoming the ordinary name of the existing nation, except where it is used with some special mark of distinction. The object of their enquiry is not mentioned, nor is it even expressly said that they made any enquiry; but the message to them implies this, and from what is said to them we may probably gather what was uppermost in their minds. Already told by the previous prophecies that God would not spare Jerusalem for its own sake, and that His long forbearance hitherto was no warrant for its continuance, they still evidently cherished the hope that, however sinful they might be in themselves, their city would yet be delivered for the sake of the holy men who lived therein. With such thoughts in their minds the elders came and sat before the prophet, in whose fearless words they had already learned to have confidence, and waited what he might have to say to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - As the result, probably, of the previous utterances, certain <span class="cmt_word">elders of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of the exiles in Tel-Abib, came to consult Ezekiel, wishing to know what counsels or what predictions he had for them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a> we have "the elders of Judah," and it is possible that there were two groups in the Population of the town, and that these represented Israel as distinct from Judah - a deputation, as it were, from the earlier exiles. The term appears again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ezekiel 20:1</a>. More probably, however, the terms are used interchangeably. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 No outward form or reformation can be acceptable to God, so long as any idol possesses the heart; yet how many prefer their own devices and their own righteousness, to the way of salvation! Men's corruptions are idols in their hearts, and are of their own setting up; God will let them take their course. Sin renders the sinner odious in the eyes of the pure and holy God; and in his own eyes also, whenever conscience is awakened. Let us seek to be cleansed from the guilt and pollution of sins, in that fountain which the Lord has opened.</body></html>
