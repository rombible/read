Israel being a theocracy, its fundamental law against idol-worship could not be violated with impunity by those who sought the protection of its government (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/20-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 20:1-2</a>, &c.). In this case, however, outward idolatry is not alleged, as the accusations of this verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-4.htm" title="Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that comes according to the multitude of his idols;">Ezekiel 14:4</a> refer only to the secret idolatry of the heart; and the point insisted upon is not so much the idol-worship in itself, as the hypocrisy of attempting to join with this the enquiring of the Lord. God declares that He will answer such hypocrisy, in whomsoever it may be found, not by the prophet through whom the enquiry is made, but by Himself interposing to punish the enquirer, and to make him an example to deter others from a like course.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The stranger that sojourneth among you.</span> It is noticeable that Ezekiel uses here and elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22, 23</a>) the familiar phrase of the books which most influenced his teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9.htm">Numbers 9, 15</a>; Deuteronomy <span class="accented">passim</span>). It is probable that some such proselytes were found among the exiles of Tel Abib. <span class="cmt_word">I the Lord will answer him</span> <span class="cmt_word">by myself,</span> etc. This, as has been seen, was probably the right reading in ver. 4. What it means is that, instead of a spoken answer by the mouth of the prophet, there should be an answer in the discipline of life, in the immediate utterance through the conscience, which was the voice of God. The inquirer who came with unconfessed and unrepented hankerings after the worship of other gods deserved and would receive no other answer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 No outward form or reformation can be acceptable to God, so long as any idol possesses the heart; yet how many prefer their own devices and their own righteousness, to the way of salvation! Men's corruptions are idols in their hearts, and are of their own setting up; God will let them take their course. Sin renders the sinner odious in the eyes of the pure and holy God; and in his own eyes also, whenever conscience is awakened. Let us seek to be cleansed from the guilt and pollution of sins, in that fountain which the Lord has opened.</body></html>
