that had already passed away, but still their heart was not right. Like Lot's wife, they longed for that which they dared not do. With such a disposition, they were in the greatest danger, putting "the stumbling-block of their iniquity," the temptation to sin, directly before them. And not only so, but they kept themselves in a state of alienation from God, so that it was idle to imagine He would allow Himself to be enquired of by them. The question implies the negative answer which is fully expressed in the following verses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These men,</span> etc. The prophet, taught by the word of the Lord, reads the hearts of those who came to him. The words do not imply, rather they exclude, the open practice of idolatry. The sin of the inquirers was that they had set up idols (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>, Ezekiel's favourite word; see note on Ezekiel 6:4) in their hearts. The LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>,"thoughts of their hearts," as if to express this. They were hankering after the old false worships in which they had once, taken part. <span class="cmt_word">The stumbling block</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-20.htm">Ezekiel 3:20</a>) <span class="cmt_word">of their iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">was set up there.</span> That divided heart, the "double mind" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>, made true inquiry, as it made true prayer for guidance, impossible. <span class="cmt_word">Shall I be inquired of at all,</span> etc.? The "at all" represents the emphatic iteration of the verb in the Hebrew. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">Numquid interrogatus respondebo eis</span>? gives a fair paraphrase. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 No outward form or reformation can be acceptable to God, so long as any idol possesses the heart; yet how many prefer their own devices and their own righteousness, to the way of salvation! Men's corruptions are idols in their hearts, and are of their own setting up; God will let them take their course. Sin renders the sinner odious in the eyes of the pure and holy God; and in his own eyes also, whenever conscience is awakened. Let us seek to be cleansed from the guilt and pollution of sins, in that fountain which the Lord has opened.</body></html>
