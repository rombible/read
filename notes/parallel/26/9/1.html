The "loud voice" was to give emphasis to what is said; it is the natural expression of the fierceness of the Divine indignation and wrath.<p><span class= "bld">Them that have charge over the city.</span>--Not earthly officers, but those to whom God has especially entrusted the execution of His will concerning Jerusalem. The word is, no doubt, used often enough of human officers, but such sense is necessarily excluded here by the whole circumstances of the vision. Nor does the phrase "every man" at all indicate that they were human beings, the same expression being constantly used of angels (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/18-1.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;">Genesis 18:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-11.htm" title="And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man that spoke to the woman? And he said, I am.">Judges 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-16.htm" title="And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.">Daniel 8:16</a>, &c), and the representation here being plainly that of angelic executioners of God's wrath. They appear only in the light of the administrators of vengeance, the description of them being that each had "his destroying weapon in his hand." This is repeated in the following verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cried,</span> etc. The voice comes, as before, from the human form, seen as a theophany, in the midst of the Divine glory. <span class="cmt_word">Cause them that have charge over the city.</span> The noun is an abstract plural, commonly rendered "visitation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-23.htm">Jeremiah 11:23</a>, and elsewhere). Here, however, it clearly stands for persons (just as we use "the watch" for "the watchmen"), and is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11</a>). The persons addressed are called "men," but they are clearly thought of as superhuman; like the angels who came to Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>); like the angel with the drawn sword in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">His destroying weapon.</span> The word clearly implies something different from a sword, but corresponds in its vagueness to the Hebrew. In ver. 2 the Hebrew for "slaughter weapon" implies an instrument for crashing into fragments, probably an axe or mace. A cognate word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a> is translated "battle axe," and the LXX. gives that meaning here, as also does the margin of the Revised Version. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-4 It is a great comfort to believers, that in the midst of destroyers and destructions, there is a Mediator, a great High Priest, who has an interest in heaven, and in whom saints on earth have an interest. The representation of the Divine glory from above the ark, removed to the threshold, denoted that the Lord was about to leave his mercy-seat, and to pronounce judgment on the people. The distinguishing character of this remnant that is to be saved, is such as sigh and cry to God in prayer, because of the abominations in Jerusalem. Those who keep pure in times of general wickedness, God will keep safe in times of general trouble and distress.</body></html>
