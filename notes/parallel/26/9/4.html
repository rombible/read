This, in many of the ancient alphabets, and especially in that in use among the Hebrews up to this time, and long retained upon their coins, was in the form of a cross--X or +. Much stress was laid upon this use of the sign of the cross as the mark for the Divine mercy by the older Christian writers, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, and Jerome. This marking was done, it is true, in vision, but the symbolism is taken from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-15.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.">Genesis 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-7.htm" title="And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.">Exodus 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm" title="And the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.">Exodus 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm" title="And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave on it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.">Exodus 28:36</a>; and it is used several times in the Apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-3.htm" title="Now is the end come on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense on you all your abominations.">Ezekiel 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-1.htm" title="Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me, and sat before me.">Ezekiel 14:1</a>). Such marks may be necessary for the guidance of the angelic executors of God's commands, and at all events, the symbolism is of value to the human mind. It is with reference to such Scriptural instances of marking, doubtless, that the Church has provided for the signing of the baptized with the sign of the cross. It is to be observed here that the distinction of the marking has reference wholly and only to character. No regard is paid to birth or position; they and they only are marked who mourned for the prevailing sinfulness, and kept themselves apart from it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set a mark upon the foreheads,</span> etc. The command reminds us of that given to the destroying angel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>, and has its earlier and later analogues in the mark set upon Cain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>), and in the "sealing" of the servants of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>. Here, as in the last example, the mark is set, not on the lintels of the doorposts, but upon the "foreheads" of the men. And the mark is the letter <span class="accented">tau</span>, in old Hebrew, that of a cross + , and like the "mark" of mediaeval and (in the case of the illiterate) of modern usage, seems to have been used as a signature, and is rightly so translated in the Revised Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35</a>. Jewish writers have accounted for its being thus used, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from its being the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and thus denoting completeness, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from its being the first letter of the word <span class="accented">thorah</span> (Law); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> from its standing in the same position in the Hebrew word for "thou shalt live." Christian writers (Origen, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>; Tertullian, 'Adv. Marcion,' 3:22) have not unnaturally seen in it a quasi-prophetic reference to the sign of the cross as used by Christians, and it is possible that the use of that sign in baptism may have originated in this passage. That was to be the sign of the elect of God in the midst of a world lying in wickedness. Possibly in older as in later forms of idolatry (as <span class="accented">eg.</span> in the cultus of Mithras, Vishnu, Sehiva), the votaries of this or that deity may have been distinguished by some outward note of this kind; but of this, though suggested by Currey, I do not find any evidence. It is clear, however, that there could be no anticipation of the Christian symbolism in the minds of Ezeldel or of his hearers. The "mark" was to be placed on all who were still faithful to the worship of their fathers, though they could show their faithfulness only by lamentation of the national apostasy. Such, of course, were Jeremiah, and Baruch, and Ahikam, and Shaphan, and Gedaliah, and others, and such as these Ezekiel may have had present in his thoughts. Against all others (ver. 5) they were sent forth with unsparing severity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-4 It is a great comfort to believers, that in the midst of destroyers and destructions, there is a Mediator, a great High Priest, who has an interest in heaven, and in whom saints on earth have an interest. The representation of the Divine glory from above the ark, removed to the threshold, denoted that the Lord was about to leave his mercy-seat, and to pronounce judgment on the people. The distinguishing character of this remnant that is to be saved, is such as sigh and cry to God in prayer, because of the abominations in Jerusalem. Those who keep pure in times of general wickedness, God will keep safe in times of general trouble and distress.</body></html>
