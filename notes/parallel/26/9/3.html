The word <span class= "ital">cherub </span>is here used collectively. Now that special glory above the cherubim, which represented the Divine Being Himself, was gone from its place to the threshold of the house, but is returned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm" title="Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.">Ezekiel 10:1</a>. At the same time, there is also suggested the idea that the ordinary presence of God between the cherubim in the Holy of Holies within the Temple has left its place, and come out to the door of the house. The two ideas are indeed distinct, and yet by no means incapable of being blended in the imagery of a vision. The significance of the former is that the command for judgment proceeds from the very Temple itself to which the Pharisaic Jews looked as the pledge of their safety; while the other would mean that the Lord had already begun to forsake His Temple. Both thoughts are true, and both are emphasised in the course of the vision.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was gone up;</span> better, <span class="accented">went up.</span> The prophet saw the process as well as the result. The "glory of the Lord" which he bad seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>) by the northern gate rose from its cherub throne (we note the use of the singular to express the unity of the fourfold form), as if to direct the action of his ministers, to the threshold of the "house." This may be connected also with the thought that the normal abiding place of the presence of the Lord had been "between the cherubim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>) of the mercy seat, but that thought seems in the present instance to be in the background, and I adopt the former interpretation as preferable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-4 It is a great comfort to believers, that in the midst of destroyers and destructions, there is a Mediator, a great High Priest, who has an interest in heaven, and in whom saints on earth have an interest. The representation of the Divine glory from above the ark, removed to the threshold, denoted that the Lord was about to leave his mercy-seat, and to pronounce judgment on the people. The distinguishing character of this remnant that is to be saved, is such as sigh and cry to God in prayer, because of the abominations in Jerusalem. Those who keep pure in times of general wickedness, God will keep safe in times of general trouble and distress.</body></html>
