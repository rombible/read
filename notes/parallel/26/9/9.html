Not idolatry only, but its natural fruits, bloodshed and oppression, had eaten into the life of the nation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>). And these evils had their root in the practical atheism of the denials which had been already uttered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>. and which are here reproduced. The unpitying aspect of God's judgments is, for the present, dominant, and the work must be thorough. One notes how the despair of the prophet leads him to forget those who were to have the mark upon their foreheads, who were indeed the true "remnant." Like Elijah, he does not know of any such (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>); like Jeremiah, he searches through the streets of Jerusalem, and cannot find one righteous man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:5-11 The slaughter must begin at the sanctuary, that all may see and know that the Lord hates sin most in those nearest to him. He who was appointed to protect, reported the matter. Christ is faithful to the trust reposed in him. Is he commanded by his Father to secure eternal life to the chosen remnant? He says, Of all that thou hast given me, I have lost none. If others perish, and we are saved, we must ascribe the difference wholly to the mercy of our God, for we too have deserved wrath. Let us still continue to plead in behalf of others. But where the Lord shows no mercy he does no injustice; he only recompenses men's ways.</body></html>
