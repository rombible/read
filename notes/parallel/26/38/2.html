Early Jewish tradition, adopted by Josephus and St. Jerome, identifies them with the Scythians; and this view has seemed probable to nearly all modern expositors. But the name of Scythians must be understood rather in a geographical than in a strictly ethnological sense, of the tribes living north of the Caucasus. Driven from their original home by the Massagetae, they had poured down upon Asia Minor and Syria shortly before the time of Ezekiel, and had advanced even as far as Egypt. They took Sardis (B.C. 629), spread themselves in Media (B.C. 624), were bribed off from Egypt by Psammeticus, and were finally driven back (B.C. 596), leaving their name as a terror to the whole eastern world for their fierce skill in war, their cruelty, and rapacity. It was probably the memory of their recent disastrous inroads that led Ezekiel to the selection of their name as the representative of the powers hostile to the Church of God.<p>The name Gog occurs only in connection with Magog, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-4.htm" title="The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,">1Chronicles 5:4</a>, as the name of an otherwise unknown Reubenite. It is also the reading of the Samaritan and Septuagint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-7.htm" title="He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.">Numbers 24:7</a> for Agag. It has generally been supposed that Ezekiel here formed the name from Magog by dropping the first syllable, which was thought to mean simply <span class= "ital">place</span> or <span class= "ital">land;</span> but an Assyrian inscription has been discovered, in which <span class= "ital">Ga-a-gi</span> is mentioned as a chief of the Saka (Scythians), and Mr. Geo. Smith ("Hist. of Assurbanipal") identifies this name with Gog. The text should be read, <span class= "ital">Gog, of the land of Magog.</span><p><span class= "bld">The chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.</span> Our version has followed St. Jerome in translating <span class= "ital">Rosh</span> "chief," because formerly no people of that name was definitely known; but they are frequently mentioned by Arabic writers as a Scythian tribe dwelling in the Taurus, although the attempt to derive from them the name of <span class= "ital">Russian</span> cannot be considered as sufficiently supported. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm" title="And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.">Revelation 20:8</a>, Gog and Magog are both symbolic names of nations. For Meshech and Tubal see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thy face against</span> (or, toward) <span class="cmt_word">God</span>. Although occurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-4.htm">1 Chronicles 5:4</a> as the name of a Reubenite, Gog was probably a title formed by Ezekiel himself from the word <span class="accented">Magog</span>, the syllable <span class="accented">ma</span> being treated as equivalent to "land." A similar freedom appears to have been exercised by the author of the Apocalypse, who out of Magog, here a territorial designation, makes a military power co-ordinate with Gog (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>). That Gog was not an actual person - though the name reminds one of that of the Lydian king Gyges, as it appears on the monuments, <span class="accented">Gu-gu</span>, <span class="accented">Gu-ug-gu</span>, aud of that of one <span class="accented">Sa-gi</span>, or <span class="accented">Sa-agi</span>, the ruler of another Eastern territory not yet identified (see Schrader, 'Die Keilinschriften und dos Alto Testament,' p. 427; and comp. 'Records of the Past,' first series, vol. 9:46) - but an ideal character, must be held as proved by the composite structure of his army, which was drawn from the four comers of the globe, as well as by the highly imaginative texture of the whole prophecy, which, as Hengstenberg properly remarks, has a thoroughly "utopian [perhaps better, 'ideal'] character," showing that it moves "in the region of holy fancy." The words, <span class="cmt_word">the land of Magog</span>, are not, with Havernick, Ewald, and Smend, to be interpreted as the local or geographical terminus of the prediction, as if the word of God had said, "Set thy face toward Gog, toward the laud of Magog;" but, with the majority of expositors, as a territorial designation signifying that Gog was in or of the laud of Magog, which is here marked with the article, probably to identify it with the well-known Magog mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, along with Tubal and Mesech as among the descendants of Japheth. From the circumstance that in the table of nations Magog stands between Gomer (the Cimmerians) and Madai (the Medians), and that Gomer appears in Gog's army, it has been not unreasonably concluded that to Ezekiel Magog represented a fierce Northern tribe, most likely, as Josephus ('Ant.,' 1:06. 1) asserts, the Scythians, whose territories lay upon the borders Of the sea of Azov and in the Caucasus. Plumptre even thinks that, "placed as Ezekiel was, he may well have come into contact with these Scythian tribes, either as part of Nebuchadnezzar's army or by a journey on his part into the regions north of Ararat" ('Ezekiel: an Ideal Biography,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 8. p. 291, second series). Yet, could both of these hypotheses be established, it would not follow that Ezekiel was thinking merely, as Knobel and Gesenius suppose, of a future struggle which Israel should have to maintain against these <span class="accented">genres Scythicas immanes et innumerabiles</span>, as Jerome in his day described them. In addition to being named from his land, Gog is further distinguished by the peoples over whom he rules, Ezekiel styling him <span class="cmt_word">the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal</span> - a translation adhered to by Hengstenberg, Ewald, and Smend; or, according to the LXX., which most expositors and the Revised Version follow, <span class="accented">the prince of Rosh</span>, <span class="accented">Meshech</span>, <span class="accented">and Tubal</span>. The former rendering is obtained by interpreting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> after the analogy of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, "chief priest," or "minister," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>; and is supported by a similar use of the word <span class="accented">rosh</span> on coins under the government of the Persian satraps; yet the second rendering is not devoid of considerations that may be urged in its favor. Besides being grammatically possible, it yields a souse which is not improbable. Byzantine and Arabian writers of the tenth century were acquainted with a people called <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, who were Scythian mountaineers, dwelling north of the Taurus, on the shores of the Black Sea and on the banks of the Volga. The Koran speaks of a land of Ras not far from the Araxes. Whether either of these can be connected with present-day Russians, as Gesenius suggests - an hypothesis which Hengstenberg protests deals hardly with the poor Russians - must be left undecided. So must the question whether the people inquired after can be identified, as Delitzsch suggests, with the inhabitants of the land of Raseh (<span class="accented">mat Ra-a-si</span>) of the Inscriptions, which was Situated on the confines of Elam on the Tigris (see Schrader, 'Die Keilin-schriften und das Alto Testament,' p. 427; and comp. 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 84, 11. 122, 124). At the same time, Jerome's objection will scarcely hold good against understanding Resh as the name of a people, viz. that the Bible elsewhere has no knowledge of any such people, since, as Havernick observes, "one cannot know beforehand whether to Ezekiel, in his then place of abode, the knowledge of such a people was not likely sooner to come than to any Old Testament writer," and it is certain that the Book of Ezekiel is not wanting in names that occur only once, as e.g. Chilmad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-23.htm">Ezekiel 27:23</a>) and Chub (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). Hitzig points out that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, along with Mesech and Tubal, is mentioned a third nation, <span class="accented">Tiras</span>, which Yon Hammer has attempted to connect with Rosh; while Schroder sees in Rosh (allied to Ross, "horse") an indication that the people were equestrian in their habits, like the Scythians. The other peoples, Meshech and Tubal, were undoubtedly the Mosohians and Tibarenes, <span class="accented">who</span>, according to Herodotus (3:94; 7:78), dwelt south of the Black Sea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-13 These events will be in the latter days. It is supposed these enemies will come together to invade the land of Judea, and God will defeat them. God not only sees who are now the enemies of his church, but he foresees who will be so, and lets them know by his word that he is against them; though they join together, the wicked shall not be unpunished.</body></html>
