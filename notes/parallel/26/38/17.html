The word <span class= "ital">many</span> before "years" is not in the original, but is correctly inserted to mark the accusative of duration. The statement is then an emphatic one, that God had of old and for a long time foretold by His prophets this attack of Gog. But the name of Gog is not mentioned in any earlier prophecy now extant, nor is it likely that any such, far less that any long series of such prophecies, have been lost. This concurs with many other indications in the prophecy to show that it does not relate to any particular event, but that Gog and his allies represent the enemies of the Church in general, and that the prophet is here depicting the same great and prolonged struggle between evil and good, between the powers of the world and the kingdom of God, which has formed the burden of so much of both earlier and later prophecy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time</span>? As no existing prophecy, prior to Ezekiel's time, mentions Cog by name, it must be concluded either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ezekiel refers to prophecies known in his day, though no longer extant; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that his words simply mean that earlier prophets had predicted such an invasion of Israel in the last times as that which he announces under the leadership of Gog. The former opinion, though countenanced by Ewald, Kuenen, and Smend, is less probable than the latter, which expositors both ancient and modern favor. Schroder considers the hypothesis that earlier prophets had spoken of Gog by name as excluded by the interrogatory form of the sentence, since, had Cog been thus explicitly pointed out, there would, he thinks, have been no need to ask, "Art thou he?" But it is doubtful if the interrogatory form of the words had any other intention than to lend emphasis to the assertion that Gog was he to whom the earlier prophets had unconsciously referred. As to which earlier prophets he alluded opinions vary. Ewald cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>; Smend adding <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>; Keil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23</a>, 25; Joel 4:2, 11, etc.; Hengstenberg, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; and Fairbairn, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-28.htm">Isaiah 14:28-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18.htm">Isaiah 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3.htm">Joel 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44, 45</a>; though Schroder is probably correct in holding that all should be included which represent the hostility of the heathen world as culminating in the latter days in a grand concentrated attack upon Israel. Smend sees in the unusual phenomenon that Ezekiel reflects upon earlier prophecies an indication of the declining spirit of prophetism; it should, however, rather be regarded as a sign of superior spiritual insight on the part of Ezekiel, who could discern that from the first the prophets had been guided in their utterances by One who was intimately acquainted with the whole world-program, and knew the end from the beginning, so that however dark and enigmatical their predictions might be when taken separately, when viewed in connection they were recognized as forming parts of a harmonious whole. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:14-23 The enemy should make a formidable descent upon the land of Israel. When Israel dwell safely under the Divine protection, shalt not thou be made to know it by finding that endeavours to destroy them are made in vain? Promises of security are treasured up in the word of God, against the troubles and dangers the church may be brought into in the latter days. In the destruction of sinners, God makes it appear that he is a great and holy God. We should desire and pray daily. Father, glorify thine own name.</body></html>
