The expression, <span class="cmt_word">my fury shall come up in my face</span>; or, <span class="accented">my</span> wrath <span class="accented">ascends in rail nose</span>, has parallels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-8.htm">Ezekiel 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>, and describes the vehement breathing (inhalation and exhalation) of an angry man through his nose. <span class="cmt_word">The fire of Jehovah's wrath</span> (comp. Ezekiel 21:36; 36:5) should make itself known in that day by <span class="cmt_word">a great shaking in the land of Israel</span>, which can hardly, as Kliefoth surmises, refer to the final judgment, or, as Keil thinks, to the trembling of the whole earth, with all the creatures, before the Lord, who comes to judgment, as in Joel 4:16 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4, 5</a>, since the locality in which this convulsion of nature is to happen is expressly defined as "the land of Israel;" but must be understood, with Schroder and Smend, as a figurative description of the terrible overthrow which Jehovah should inflict upon Gog, and which should produce within the heathen mind a feeling of consternation, as if the whole fabric of the globe were falling into ruin. Grounding upon what occurred at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>), Hebrew writers generally depicted special interpositions of Jehovah as being witnessed to and accompanied by awe-inspiring natural convulsions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-2.htm">Psalm 55:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>); and in the same manner does Ezekiel delineate Jehovah's intervention in behalf of Israel and against Gog, as so alarming that all living creatures, irrational as well as rational - <span class="cmt_word">fishes of the sea, fowls of the heaven, beasts of the field, creeping things that creep upon the earth</span> (or, <span class="accented">ground - adamah</span>), and men upon the face of the earth; or, <span class="accented">ground</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21-23</a>) - should shake at its accompanying manifestations, and that even the mightiest objects in nature, such as the <span class="cmt_word">mountains, steep places</span>, or, "reek-clefts" (Ewald), such elevations as can only be ascended by means of steps as by a ladder (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-14.htm">Song of Solomon 2:14</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and walls</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>), including natural ramparts as well as humanly constructed erections, should be overthrown (ver. 20). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:14-23 The enemy should make a formidable descent upon the land of Israel. When Israel dwell safely under the Divine protection, shalt not thou be made to know it by finding that endeavours to destroy them are made in vain? Promises of security are treasured up in the word of God, against the troubles and dangers the church may be brought into in the latter days. In the destruction of sinners, God makes it appear that he is a great and holy God. We should desire and pray daily. Father, glorify thine own name.</body></html>
