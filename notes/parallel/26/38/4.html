but if this meaning be retained here, it is not to be taken in the sense of turning back from the holy land, but rather, in connection with the figure of the next clause, of turning away the wild beast from his natural inclination to the fulfilment of God's purpose. It is better, however, to take it in the sense in which it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-10.htm" title="For you have trusted in your wickedness: you have said, None sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you; and you have said in your heart, I am, and none else beside me.">Isaiah 47:10</a> (perverted) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-5.htm" title="Why then is this people of Jerusalem slid back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.">Jeremiah 8:5</a> (slidden back; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-6.htm" title="And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.">Ezekiel 1:6</a>), "I will lead thee astray." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm" title="And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.">Revelation 20:8</a>, this leading astray of the nations is ascribed to Satan, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-1.htm" title="And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.">2Samuel 24:1</a>, God, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1Chronicles 21:1</a>, Satan, are said to move David to number the people; in either case God is said to do that which He allows to be done by Satan. For the same Divine gathering of the nations against God's people see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm" title="I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.">Joel 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/14-2.htm" title="For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.">Zechariah 14:2-3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Hooks into thy jaws.</span>--See the same figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm" title="But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will bring you up out of the middle of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick to your scales.">Ezekiel 29:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will turn thee back</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> (pilel of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, and signifying "to cause to return") has by Hitzig, Havernick, Ewald, and Keil, been interpreted in the sense of "enticing," "misleading," decoying to a dangerous enterprise, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10</a>; but the ordinary meaning seems sufficient, that Jehovah would turn him back from his own self-devised career, or turn him about like a wild beast, putting hooks into his jaws (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a>), and so compelling him to follow the lead of a power superior to himself. It is as evident that a turning back from the Holy Land cannot be intended, as it is that a turning back to the Holy Land is unsuitable, unless, with Hengstenberg and Ewald, one regards Gog as the Chaldeans, or, with Hitzig, and Schroder, as the Scythiaus, though these latter never were in Palestine, having left it unvisited in their campaign in <span class="date">B.C. 626</span>, and had not as yet formed the design of invading Israel. Smend is not wide of the mark in suggesting that the thought expressed in the verb is simply that of the superior might of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">I will bring thee forth</span>. That the power which stirs up Gog is here represented as that of Jehovah, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a> it is affirmed to be that of Satan, need occasion no more difficulty than the similar statements, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>, about God and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a> about Satan, stirring up David to number Israel. The enumeration of <span class="cmt_word">horses and horsemen</span> in Gog's army points to the Scythians, who, according to Herodotus (4:46, 136), were mostly equestrian tribes, although the Scythian remains discovered at Kerteh do not give an example of a Scythian horse-archer (see Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. p. 34, note 6). <span class="cmt_word">All of them clothed with all sorts</span> of armor, better, <span class="accented">clothed with perfection</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> splendidly attired, <span class="accented">all of them</span>. A characteristic of the Assyrian army (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a>). The arms of the warlike host - <span class="cmt_word">a great company</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>, "the number of whom is as the sand of the sea") - are described as consisting of bucklers, <span class="accented">or</span> shields large enough to cover the whole of the soldier, and not so suitable for cavalry as for infantry (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-24.htm">Ezekiel 23:24</a>); shields, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bucklers of smaller size than the proceeding, such as Assyrian warriors were accustomed to carry (Sayce, 'Assyria, its Princes, Priests, and People,' p. 126); and swords, or weapons for laying waste. The Assyrian soldiery employed "the short dagger, or dirk, and the sword, which was of two kinds. The ordinary kind was long and straight, the less usual kind being curved, like a scimitar" ('Assyria, its Princes,' etc.). In connection with the allied nations in ver. 5, only the small "shield" and "helmet" are mentioned. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-13 These events will be in the latter days. It is supposed these enemies will come together to invade the land of Judea, and God will defeat them. God not only sees who are now the enemies of his church, but he foresees who will be so, and lets them know by his word that he is against them; though they join together, the wicked shall not be unpunished.</body></html>
