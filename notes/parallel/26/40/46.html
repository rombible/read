These formed another body of priests, whose duties generally were to officiate in the temple-worship, and more specifically to sacrifice and burn incense upon the altars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-6</a>.). Under the Law the priests were all descendants of Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9, 44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>).

When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
