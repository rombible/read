It is difficult or impossible to fix with precision the length of the cubit of Scripture, more especially as the value of the measure appears to have changed in the course of ages. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-3.htm" title="Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was three score cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.">2Chronicles 3:3</a> the measurements of Solomon's Temple are given "by cubits after the first [or ancient] measure." It appears, therefore, that the cubit in common use at the time of the compilation of that book (after the return from the captivity) was different from the standard Mosaic cubit. Ezekiel evidently intends to use the latter in his Temple measurements, and therefore adds "an hand breadth" to the common cubit. Different writers vary in their estimate of the length of the measure thus obtained from eighteen to twenty-four inches. By considering it twenty inches we shall have a convenient number for use, and cannot be far wrong. The "reed of six cubits" was therefore about ten feet long.<p><span class= "bld">The breadth of the building--</span><span class= "ital">i.e., the thickness of the wall surrounding the court.</span> The length of this wall is not given until <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm" title="So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.">Ezekiel 40:47</a>. The thickness and height are made equal, evidently for the sake of the symmetry of the measures. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm" title="And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.">Revelation 21:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">outer court</span>, with its gates and chambers: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the enclosing wall (ver. 5); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the east gate (ver. 5-16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the outer court (ver. 17-19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the north gale (ver. 20-23); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the south gate (ver. 24-27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">enclosing wall</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about.</span> The "house" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> with the article - was the temple as the dwelling-place of Jehovah; only not the temple proper, but the whole complex structure. The "wall" belonged to the outer court; that of the inner court being afterwards mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7</a>). In having a "wall round about" Jehovah's sanctuary resembled both Greek and Babylonian shrines (see Herod., 1:18; ' Records of the Past,' vol. 5:126), but differed from both the tabernacle, which had none, and from the Solomonic temple, whose "wall" formed no essential part of the sacred structure, but was more or less of arbitrary erection on the part of Solomon and later kings. Here, however, the wall constituted an integral portion of the whole; and was designed, like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>, "to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place," as the Greeks distinguished between the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (see Thucyd., 4:95). Its breadth and height were the same (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>) - one reed, of <span class="cmt_word">six cubits by the cubit and an hand-breadth</span>; that is to say, each cubit measured an ordinary cubit and a hand-breadth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>). Hengstenberg suggests that the greater cubit of Ezekiel was borrowed from the Chaldeans; and certainly Herodotus (1. 178) speaks of a royal cubit in Babylon which was three finger-breadths longer than the ordinary measure, while in Egypt also two such cubits of varying lengths were current (Bockhart, 'Metrol. Untersuch,' p. 212); "from which it might be supposed," says Smend, "that the same thing held good for Asia Minor." Still, the hypothesis is likelier that the cubit in question was the old Mosaic cubit - the cubit of a man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>), equal to the length of the forearm from the elbow to the end of the longest finger - which was employed in the building of the Solomonic temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>). Assuming the cubit to have been eighteen inches, the height and breadth of the wall would be nine feet - no great elevation, and presenting a striking contrast to the colossal proportions of city walls in Babylon and in Greece (see Herod., 1:170; ' Records of the Past,' vol. 5:127, 1st series), and even of the walls of the first temple in Jerusalem (see Josephus, 'Wars,' 5:1); but in this, perhaps, lay a special significance, since, as the city-like temple stood in no need of walls and bulwarks for defense, the lowness of its walls would permit it the more easily to be seen, would, in fact, make it a conspicuous object to all who might approach it for worship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
