When the prophet had been brought into the land of Israel, to the mountain and to the building, he perceived <span class="cmt_word">a man, whoso appearance was like the appearance of brass</span>, or, according to the LXX., "shining or polished brass," <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a> - a description recalling those of the likeness of Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26, 27</a>, of the angel who appeared to Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>), and of the glorified Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>), and suggesting ideas of strength, beauty, and durability. In his hand he carried a line <span class="cmt_word">of flax and a measuring-reed</span> (<span class="accented">kaneh hammidah</span>, or "reed of measuring," reed having been the customary material out of which such rods were made; compare the Assyrian for a measuring-reed <span class="accented">qanu</span>, the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, and the Latin canna). Possibly he carried these as "emblems of building activity" (Hengstenberg), and because "he had many and different things to measure" (Kliefoth); but most likely the line was meant to measure large dimensions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>) and such as could not be taken by a straight stick, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the girth of pillars, and the rod to measure smaller dimensions, like those of the gates and walls of the temple. Hitzig's conjecture, that the line was linen because the place to be measured was the sanctuary, whose priests were obliged to clothe themselves in linen, Kliefoth rightly pronounces artificial and inaccurate, since the line was made, not of manufactured flax, or linen, but of the raw material. That the "man" was Jehovah or the Angel of the Presence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>) the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7, 8</a> and the statement of Ezekiel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-2.htm">Ezekiel 44:2, 5</a> would seem to suggest; only it is not certain in the last of these passages that the speaker was "the man" and not rather "the God of Israel," who had already taken possession of the house (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>), and whose voice is once at least distinguished from that of the man (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>). Accordingly, Kliefoth, Smend, and others identify the "man" with the ordinary <span class="accented">angelus interpres</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">gate</span> in which he stood "waiting for the new comer" was manifestly the north gate, since Ezekiel came from the north, though Havernick and Smend put in a plea for the east gate, on the grounds that it was the principal entrance to the sanctuary, and the distance between it and the north gate, five hundred cubits, was too great to be passed over so slightly as in ver. 6. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
