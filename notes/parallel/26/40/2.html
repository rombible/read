Schroder stands alone in taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> as "beside" rather than "upon," other interpreters considering that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> has here the force of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>. That this mountain, though resembling the temple hill in Jerusalem, was not that in reality, but "the mountain of the Lord's house" of Messianic times (see on Ezekiel 43:12; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6</a>), may be inferred from its greater altitude than that of either Moriah or Zion, which pointed obviously to the loftier spiritual elevation of the new Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As the frame of a city on the south.</span> What Ezekiel beheld was not "beside" or "by" (Authorized Version), but "on" the mountain, and was not, as Havernick, Ewald, and Kliefoth suppose, the new city of Jerusalem, though this might with a fair measure of accuracy be described as lying south of Moriah on which the temple stood, but the temple itself, which, with its walls and gates, chambers and courts, rose majestically before the prophet's view, with all the magnificence, and indeed (as the particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. indicates), with the external appearance of a city. That the prophet should speak of it as "on the south" receives sufficient explanation from the circumstance that he himself came from the north, and had it always before him in a southerly direction. The idea is correctly enough expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> of the LXX., which signifies "over against" to one coming from the north. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
