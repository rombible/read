Our translators, following the ancient Chaldee paraphrast, have probably given the true sense, <span class= "ital">hooks,</span> upon which the flesh of the victims was hung after it had been prepared upon the tables.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hooks</span>.

As this sense is unsuitable, recourse must be had to its derivation (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, "to put, set, or fix"), which suggests as its import here either, as Ewald, Kliefoth, Hengstenberg, Havernick, and Smend, following the LXX. and Vulgate, prefer, "ledges," or "border guards," on the edge of the tables, to keep the instruments or flesh from falling off; or, as Kimchi, Gesenius, Furst, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre, after the Chaldean paraphrast, explain, "pegs" fastened in the wall for hanging the slaughtered caresses before they were flayed. In favor of the first meaning stand the facts that the second clause of this verse speaks of" tables," not of "walls," and that the measure of the <span class="accented">shephataim</span> is one of breadth rather than of length; against it are the considerations that the dual form, <span class="accented">shephataim</span>, fits better to a forked peg than to a double border, and that the <span class="accented">shephataim</span> are stated to have been fastened "in the house" (<span class="accented">ba-baith</span>), which again suits the idea of a peg fastened in the outer wall of the porch, rather than of a border fixed upon a table. The last clause of this verse is rendered by Ewald, after the LXX., "and over the tables" (obviously those standing outside of the porch) "were covers to protect them from rain and from drought;" and it is conceivable that coverings might have been advantageous for both the wooden tables and the officiating priests; only the Hebrew must be changed before it can yield this rendering. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
