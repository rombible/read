It looked straight to the door of the Temple itself; it was by this that the glory of the Lord was afterwards seen to enter His house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east:">Ezekiel 43:1</a>); and in consequence this gate was to be kept shut, except for the prince (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/44-2.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.">Ezekiel 44:2-3</a>). The accompanying plan may be a help in understanding the description. Notwithstanding the minuteness of detail in the text, a few points remain undetermined; but the plan represents the main features correctly, and gives the most probable view of the parts that are not entirely settled.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">The stairs.--</span>These steps to the porch were seven in number (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm" title="And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.">Ezekiel 40:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm" title="And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on the posts thereof.">Ezekiel 40:26</a>) for the north and south gates, and therefore probably also for this. They were entirely outside of the threshold, and hence are not reckoned in the dimensions of the gate-building. (See plan, A.)<p><span class= "bld">One reed broad.--</span>That is, from east to west (see plan, T). This was just the thickness of the enclosing wall, w (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm" title="And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.">Ezekiel 40:5</a>). The text of this verse becomes clearer by omitting the words in italics which are not in the original; also throughout the description it is better to omit the inserted words <span class= "ital">was</span> and <span class= "ital">were,</span> since the various things mentioned are all dependent upon <span class= "ital">measured.</span><p><span class= "bld">The other threshold.--</span>This is the threshold at the opposite, or inner end of the gate-building (T?). It is mentioned here to bring out the fact that the two were alike, but is spoken of again in its place in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-7.htm" title="And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.">Ezekiel 40:7</a>.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Little chamber.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">guard-chamber,</span> and so throughout this passage. The original word is quite different from that translated "chamber" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm" title="Then brought he me into the outward court, and, see, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were on the pavement.">Ezekiel 40:17</a>, and is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-28.htm" title="And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.">1Kings 14:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-11.htm" title="And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.">2Chronicles 12:11</a> in the sense of guard-chamber. These rooms were only ten feet square, but there were three of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-10.htm" title="And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.">Ezekiel 40:10</a>) on each side of the entrance-way. They were for sentries who were to guard against the entrance of any improper person or thing (see plan, G). These guard-rooms were separated by spaces (s) one cubit narrower than themselves, which probably formed a part of the solid wall, and the ward-rooms were therefore in reality large niches in the wall.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">The porch of the gate within.--</span>The same expression as in the previous verse, and indicates a porch or vestibule to the gateway on the inner or Temple side. Its width from east to west was the same as that of the guard-rooms, added to the thickness of the porch-walls, and was probably equal also to the space occupied by the steps leading to the other end of the gateway (P).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Eight cubits.--</span>This is often considered the measurement of the porch from north to south. A more probable suggestion is that this is the same measurement as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-8.htm" title="He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.">Ezekiel 40:8</a>, but is now the external instead of the internal length. In this case the porch must be considered as built independently of the gateway proper, and having short return walls on the east and west of a cubit each. In this way the whole length of the gateway (including the porch and its "posts "), as given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-15.htm" title="And from the face of the gate of the entrance to the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.">Ezekiel 40:15</a>, exactly agrees with the details. It is accordingly so drawn on the plan.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">The posts.</span>--This verse gives the further information about the guard-chambers of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-7.htm" title="And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.">Ezekiel 40:7</a>, that they were all alike, and also about the "posts" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-9.htm" title="Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.">Ezekiel 40:9</a>, that they were alike (see plan, c). The supposition, therefore, that there was a colonnade inside the gateway is quite uncalled for. Such an arrangement would have seriously obstructed the passage-way, and is hardly supposable in view of the height of the columns mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-14.htm" title="He made also posts of three score cubits, even to the post of the court round about the gate.">Ezekiel 40:14</a>.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">The breadth of the entry of the gate.--</span>This is the measurement of the clear space between the sides of the gate, and, according to the length of the cubit adopted, was 16� feet.<p><span class= "bld">The length of the gate, thirteen cubits.--</span>This is a difficult expression, and has been variously explained. It is now generally understood of that part of the gateway which was roofed over, including the threshold of six cubits, and the first pair of guard-chambers of six cubits more, together with one cubit of the space or wall between these guard-chambers and the next. The reason for extending it over this last cubit was doubtless that the width was otherwise too great (10 cubits + 6 ? 2 = 22) to span with the roof without support. It was therefore necessary to carry it one cubit further. In the plan the part supposed to be thus roofed is marked by lines (RR). Whether there was a corresponding roofing at the other end of the gateway does not appear, but that some at least of the guard-chambers were roofed is certain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-13.htm" title="He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.">Ezekiel 40:13</a>.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">The space.</span>--The guard-chambers themselves were just six cubits square (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-7.htm" title="And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.">Ezekiel 40:7</a>), but in front of each was a space (a) of one cubit projecting into the passage way. This must have been separated by some sort of railing from the passage-way itself, although there is no mention of this. The object of this space was evidently to allow the guard to command a view of the passage-way, as they could not have done if kept behind the line of its walls.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">From the roof . . . . to the roof.--</span>This is a measurement across the gateway from north to south. The passage-way was ten cubits, each guard- chamber six, and an allowance of a cubit and a half for the outer wall will exactly make up the sum of "five and twenty cubits" (10 + 2 ? (6 + 1�) = 25).<p><span class= "bld">Door against door.--</span>The immediate object of this clause is to mark the direction in which the above measurement was taken; but besides this, it shows that there were doors to the guard-rooms. These doors were presumably in the outer wall to allow the watch. men free passage between the court and their posts of duty. There is no mention of an inner wall between these chambers and the passage-way, and it is more probable that there was none. If any existed its thickness must be deducted from that given above for the outer wall.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">He made also posts of threescore cubits.</span>--The word "made" instead of <span class= "ital">measure </span>correctly represents the original, and the change is for the obvious reason that columns of the height mentioned could not be directly measured by the reed. <span class= "ital">Made</span> is therefore used in the sense of <span class= "ital">determined</span> or <span class= "ital">fixed,</span> although we are not told by what method of calculation.<p>The height of these columns, sixty cubits, though only half that given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm" title="And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.">2Chronicles 3:4</a> as the height of the porch of Solomon's Temple, is sufficient to remind us of the Egyptian custom of placing obelisks before the doors of their temples. The height is also very great in proportion to the size of the columns, which were but two cubits square (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-9.htm" title="Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.">Ezekiel 40:9</a>). Probably the columns were engaged with the wall as far as the height of the porch, as the original word for "posts" seems to indicate, and as the dimensions of the gateway suggest. Thus buttressed the size would be sufficient for stability. It is to be remembered, however, that as in the case of the wheels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/1-16.htm" title="The appearance of the wheels and their work was like to the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.">Ezekiel 1:16-17</a>, we are here studying only a vision, not an actual structure.<p><span class= "bld">Even unto the post of the court round about the gate.</span>--This is scarcely intelligible, and even the original is obscure: <span class= "ital">lit</span>., "And unto the post the court the gate round about;" and the proper translation seems to be, "the court (extended) to the column and (was) round about the gate." The object is to show that the court reached quite to the gate-building and encircled it on three sides, so that the gate structure projected inwards from the line of the wall and terminated in the columns, beyond which, and on each side of the gate, the outer court of the Temple began.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Fifty cubits.--</span>The length of the gate-building was just twice its breadth, and was made up as follows: outer threshold, 6 cubits; three guard-rooms, each 6 cubits = 18; two "spaces" between these, each 5 cubits = 10; inner threshold, 6 cubits; porch, 8 cubits; columns, 2 cubits (6 + 18 + 10 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 50).<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Narrow windows.--</span>This is an abbreviated form of the expression used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-4.htm" title="And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.">1Kings 6:4</a> of the windows in Solomon's Temple. <span class= "ital">Narrow</span> should be <span class= "ital">closed,</span> as in the <span class= "ital">margin;</span> the windows had over them lattice-work which could not be opened. 'It is difficult to understand the situation of these windows on account of the uncertainty in the meaning of the words translated "their posts" and "the arches." The former, from its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm" title="And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.">1Kings 6:31</a>, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-3.htm" title="Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.">Ezekiel 41:3</a>, of the "side posts" of the door into the Holy of Holies, must mean the <span class= "ital">jambs</span> or parts of the wall to which the doors were attached; and the latter indicates some projection of the wall which is most probably to be explained of the "spaces" between the guard-chambers and at the sides of the inner threshold. The meaning of the whole verse will then be, that within the gateway windows were seen on both sides, both at the side of the doors leading from the court to the guard-chambers, and also in the parts of the wall projecting between the guard-chambers. On the plan these are marked (w).<p><span class= "bld">Upon each post were palm trees.</span>--The palm had been largely used in the carving of Solomon's Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm" title="And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.">1Kings 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-32.htm" title="The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.">1Kings 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-35.htm" title="And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.">1Kings 6:35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">east gate</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The gate which looketh toward the east</span>; literally, <span class="accented">whose face was toward the east</span>. That this was not the gate in which the angel had been first observed standing seems implied in the statement that he came to it. That he began with it is satisfactorily accounted for by remembering that the east gate was the principal entrance, and stood directly in front of the porch of the temple proper. The same reasons will explain the fullness of description accorded to it rather than to the others. It was ascended by <span class="cmt_word">stairs</span>, or <span class="accented">steps</span>, of which the number <span class="accented">seven</span> is omitted, though it is mentioned in connection with the north (ver. 22) and south (ver. 26) gates. "The significance was obvious," writes Plumptre. "Men must ascend in heart and mind as they enter the sanctuary, and the seven steps represented the completeness at last of that ascension." The steps lay outside the wall, and at their head had a <span class="cmt_word">threshold</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, properly an "expansion," or "spreading out") <span class="cmt_word">one reed broad</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> measuring inwards from east to west, the thickness of the wall.

When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
