but in a few important passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-21.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 12:21</a>, and here) it is described as "of our captivity." This vision was seen "in the beginning of the year." The Jews always reckoned the month Abib, or Nisan, in which the Passover was celebrated, as the beginning of the year, according to the command given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,">Exodus 12:1</a>, and the "tenth day" of that month was the day in which the preparations for the Passover began, and hence a most appropriate season for this vision of the Church of the future. Others consider that this was a Jubile year (for which there is no evidence); and since the Jubile began at the great fast of the Atonement, on the tenth day of the seventh month, it is thought that this is the day here intended. At a much later time the Jews sometimes reckoned the years from the Jubile, but there is nothing to show that this custom began so early. In either case the text distinctly says that it was fourteen years after the destruction of Jerusalem; a substantial period had, therefore, elapsed in which this great judgment would have produced its effect upon the minds of the exiles; there was thus now occasion for bringing before them the brighter hopes of the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - The <span class="accented">introduction to the vision</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the five and twentieth year of our captivity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in <span class="date">B.C. 575</span>, assuming Jehoiakin's deportation to have taken place <span class="date">B.C. 600</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the fiftieth year of the prophet's age, in the twenty-fifth of his prophetic calling, and in the fourteenth after the fall of Jerusalem. As the last note of time was the twelfth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17</a>), it may be assumed the interval was largely occupied in receiving and delivering the prophecies that fall between those dates, though it is more than likely a period of silence preceded the vision of which this last section of the book preserves an account. If not the last of the prophet's utterances (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17</a>), it was beyond question the grandest and most momentous. Accordingly, the prophet notes with his customary exactness that the vision came to him <span class="cmt_word">in the beginning of the year</span>, which Hitzig, whom Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary' follows, believes to have been a jubilee year, which began on the tenth day of the seventh month. As, however, the practice of commencing the year with this month was not introduced among the Jews till after the exile, and as Ezekiel everywhere follows the purely Mosaic arrangement of the year, the presumption is that the beginning of the year here alluded to was the month Abib, and that <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">tenth day of the month</span> was the day on which the Torah enjoined the selection of a lamb for the Passover. Indeed, the two clauses in Ezekiel read like an abbreviation of the Mosaic statute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2, 3</a>) - a circumstance sufficiently striking and probably significant, though emphasis should not, with Hengstenberg, be laid upon the fact that every word in Ezekiel's copy is found in the Exodus original. On that day, which was the anniversary of the beginning of a merciful deliverance to Israel in Egypt, of the initial step in a gracious process of transforming Pharaoh's captives into a nation, - on that day (for emphasis <span class="cmt_word">the selfsame day</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>), the prophet's soul was rapt into an ecstasy (see on Ezekiel 1:3), in which he seemed to be transported thither, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> towards the smitten city, and a disclosure made to him concerning that new community which Jehovah was about to form out of old Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
