That these "windows" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, so called from being perforated) were intended to impart light to the gateway, either in whole or in part, is apparent, though it is difficult to form a clear idea of how they were situated. They were in the chambers, and in their posts and in the arches, or <span class="accented">colonnades</span> (Revised Version margin). In the chambers, or "lodges," they were most likely in the back walls, and in or near the posts, or pillars, belonging to the doors of these chambers, the clause, "and in their posts," being regarded as epexegetic of the preceding, and designed to furnish a more precise explanation of the particular part of the guard-room in which the windows were. Similar windows existed in the Solomonic temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-4.htm">1 Kings 6:4</a>). The "arches," or "colonnades" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>), were probably wall-projections on the sides of the chambers, to that light was admitted from three sides. Thus to one standing within, the whole gateway appeared studded round and round with windows. The description of the gate closes with the statement that upon each post were palm trees, which may signify either that the shaft was fashioned like a palm tree, as is sometimes seen in ancient buildings in the East (Dr. Currey, Plumptre) or that it was ornamented with representations of palm branches or palm trees (Keil, Ewald, Kliefoth). Hengstenberg's idea, that "whole palms beside the pillars are meant," is favored by Smend, who cites, in addition to ver. 26, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a>, etc., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
