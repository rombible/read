The prophet having entered the inner court by the south gate, this is first described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/40-28.htm" title="And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;">Ezekiel 40:28-31</a>). This and the other gates of this court are essentially the same, and require the same changes of translation as in the case of the outer gates. The same plan will serve for both, remembering that it must be reversed, the porches of one set of gates facing the porches of the other set; of course the steps led to the porches of the inner gates instead of to the opposite end. The few points of difference between them will be noted as they occur.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-47.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">inner court</span>, with its gates, chambers and slaughtering-tables: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the south gate (vers. 28-31); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the cast gate (vers. 32-34); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the north gate (vers. 35-37); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span>the arrangements for sacrifice (vers. 38-43); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the chambers for the officiating priests (vers. 44-47). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-31.</span> <span class="accented">- The south gate of the inner court</span>. The construction and measurements of this corresponded with those of the gates in the outer court, with only two points of difference, viz. that it possessed a flight of <span class="cmt_word">eight steps</span> instead of seven, and that <span class="cmt_word">the arches</span>, or wall-projections, were <span class="cmt_word">toward the outer court</span>. The difference in the number of the steps was doubtless of symbolic significance, and pointed not only to the higher sanctity in general which attached to the inner court, but to the truth that, as one approached the dwelling-place of Jehovah, an increasing measure and degree of holiness were demanded - what Plumptre styles "an ever-ascending <span class="accented">sursum corda</span>." The seven steps of the outer door added to the eight steps of this amount to fifteen, with which corresponds the number of the pilgrim-psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120.htm">Psalm 120-134</a>.), which are supposed to have been sung, one upon each step, by the choir of Levites as they ascended first into the outer and then into the inner court. The statement that the wall-projections were towards the outer court showed that, in walking through the inner gateway, one would reverse the order of the outer gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> would first pass through the porch, then cross the threshold to the guard-rooms, next step upon the second threshold, and finally enter the inner court. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
