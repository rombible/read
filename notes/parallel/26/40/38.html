The word for <span class= "ital">chamber</span> is an entirely different one from that used in the former part of the chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-10.htm" title="And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.">Ezekiel 40:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/40-12.htm" title="The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.">Ezekiel 40:12-13</a>). The verse should be translated, "And a cell with its door by the posts of the gates; there they washed the burnt offering." All the arrangements for sacrificing are here described in connection with the north gate, although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-2.htm" title="And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.">Ezekiel 46:2</a> it is said that at certain festivals the prince shall enter by the east gate, and there worship while the priests prepare his offerings. In the law it was required (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-11.htm" title="And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about on the altar.">Leviticus 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-25.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.">Leviticus 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-2.htm" title="In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about on the altar.">Leviticus 7:2</a>) that all sacrifices should be slain in the court at the north side of the altar. Here the slaying is done at the north gate, but within the outer court. The reason appears to be that in the law each offerer was to slay his own victim, but here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-11.htm" title="Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.">Ezekiel 44:11</a>) the sacrifice is to be slain by the Levites, and it was therefore desirable that it should be done in the presence of the offerer and the people, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the outer court. There was also a further reason in the convenience of disposing of the flesh of the victims. Only the whole burnt offerings and the fat and the kidneys of the others required to be taken to the altar in the inner court; while all the flesh of the sin offerings and the priests' portion of the peace offerings was to be carried to the priests' cooking place (F, Plan II.) to which a walk led from this point. The rest of the flesh of the peace offerings was taken to the people's cooking places (E) in the corners of the outer court.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-43.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">arrangements for sacrifice</span>. Three things demand attention - the cells for washing, the tables for slaughtering, and the hooks. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The chambers</span>. As the verse explains, these were different from the guard-rooms in the gates (vers. 7, 21) and the chambers on the pavement (ver. 17), although the same Hebrew word is employed to designate the latter. The cells under consideration were expressly designed for washing "the inwards and the legs" of the victims brought for sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). Whether such a cell stood at each of the three gates, as the plural seems to indicate, although described only in connection with the north (Keil, Kliefoth, Plumptre), or merely at one gate, and that the north - because, according to the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-2.htm">Leviticus 7:2</a>), on the north side of the altar burnt, sin, and trespass offerings were to be killed (Havernick, Hengstenberg) - or the east, which is alluded to in vet, s. 39, 40 (Hitzig, Ewald, Smend), is controverted, though the former view seems the preferable, seeing that, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1, 2</a>, the priests were to prepare burnt offerings and peace offerings for the prince at the posts of the east gate. The situation of the cells is stated to have been <span class="cmt_word">by</span> (or, <span class="accented">beside</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the posts of</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. at) <span class="cmt_word">the gates</span> (see on ver. 14), but on which side of the gates, whether near the right or left pillar, no information is furnished. Keil and Kliefoth place those at the south and north gates on the west side; that at the east gate Keil locates on its north side, Kliefoth placing one in the side wall at each side of the gate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
