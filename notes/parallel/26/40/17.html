In accordance with the general symmetry of the arrangements, it may be assumed that there were ten on each of the three sides not occupied by the Temple buildings, and that five were on each side of the gate.

They are drawn as if joined together; but this is not certain. Such chambers for the use of officiating priests and Levites, and for the storage of the tithes, are mentioned both in connection with Solomon's Temple and with that of the restoration (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm" title="And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:">Jeremiah 35:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.">1Chronicles 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/10-38.htm" title="And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house.">Nehemiah 10:38-39</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">outer court</span>. Emerging from the doorway inwards, the prophet, accompanied by his celestial guide, stepped into the outward court, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the area surrounding the temple buildings. There the first thing observed was that <span class="cmt_word">chambers and a pavement</span> ran round the court. The chambers were cells, or rooms - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> always signifying single rooms in a building (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>) - whose dimensions, exact sites, and uses are not specified, though, as they were thirty in number, it is probable they were arranged on the east, north, and south sides of the court, five upon each side of the gate, and standing somewhat apart from each other; that they were large enough to contain as many as thirty persons (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a>); and that they were designed for sacrificial meals and such-like purposes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, etc.). In pre-exilic times such halls had been occupied by distinguished person s connected with the temple service (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-8.htm">Ezekiel 8:8-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 36:10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>). The pavement was a tessellated floor (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>), which ran round the court and was named <span class="cmt_word">the lower pavement</span>, to distinguish it from that laid in the inner court which stood at a higher elevation than the outer. As another note of position, it is stated to have been by the side (literally, <span class="accented">shoulder</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the gates over against</span> - or, <span class="accented">answerable to</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">the length of the gates</span>. This can only mean that the breadth of the pavement was fifty cubits (the length of the gates, ver. 15) less six cubits (the thickness of the wall, ver. 5), or forty-four cubits, and that it ran along the inner length of the wall on either side of the gates. The breadth of the court <span class="cmt_word">from the forefront of the lower gate</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the inner end of the east gate or the edge of the pavement, <span class="cmt_word">unto the forefront of the inner court</span> <span class="cmt_word">without was an hundred cubits</span>. Whether the measurement was up to the wall of the inner court, within which, on this hypothesis, its gate must have wholly lain, or only up to the door of the inner court, which, on this understanding, must have projected beyond its wall, is obscure. The first interpretation derives support from the circumstance that the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of the measurement is said to have been, not the inner gate, but the inner court; while the second finds countenance in the use of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span>, which seems to indicate that the measuring proceeded from the western extremity of the outer gate to the eastern extremity of the inner gate, and appears to be confirmed by vers. 23 and 27, as well as by the consideration that in this way the symmetry of the building would be better preserved than by making the outer gate project into the court and the inner gate lie wholly within the inner wall. In this way the hundred cubits marked the distance between the extremities of the gates, the whole breadth of the court being two hundred cubits, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hundred cubits between the gates, with two gates' lengths of fifty cubits each added. The same measurements applied to the north gate, which the seer next approached. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-49 The Vision of the Temple. - Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.</body></html>
