This derivation, however, is probably wrong; all the ancient versions give a sense corresponding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm" title="And I will turn you back, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armor, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:">Ezekiel 38:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm" title="And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.">Ezekiel 38:16</a>, and also to the clauses immediately before and after, "I will lead thee along." The greater part of the modern commentators concur in this view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will... leave but the sixth part of thee</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> is derived either from the numeral six, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, or from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, the import of which is uncertain, although a cognate root in Ethiopic suggests the idea of "going on" or "proceeding" - a meaning Havernick also finds in the Hebrew. The former derivation has been followed by the Authorized Version, which renders in the margin, "I will strike thee with six plagues," or "draw thee back with a hook of six teeth," and by Hengstenberg, With whom Plumptre agrees, "1 will six thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "afflict thee with six plagues," viz. those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>. The latter derivation, presumably the more correct, is adopted by the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>), <span class="accented">the</span> Vulgate (<span class="accented">educam</span>), the Revised Version ("I will lead thee on"), and by modern expositors generally. Hitzig and Smend approve of Ewald's translation, "I entice thee astray, and lead thee with leading, strings." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-10 The Lord will make the most careless and hardened transgressors know his holy name, either by his righteous anger, or by the riches of his mercy and grace. The weapons formed against Zion shall not prosper. Though this prophecy is to be fulfilled in the latter days, it is certain. From the language used, it seems that the army of Gog will be destroyed by miracle.</body></html>
