The language, if it could be supposed it was meant to be literally understood, would be even more extravagant than that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/39-9.htm" title="And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand staves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:">Ezekiel 39:9-10</a>. The whole nation of Israel is represented as engaged for seven months in burying the bodies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/39-12.htm" title="And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.">Ezekiel 39:12-13</a>); after this an indefinite time is to be occupied by one corps of men appointed to search the land for still remaining bones, and by another who are to bury them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10</span> set forth as the first proof of the greatness of Gog's overthrow the immense booty in the shape of weapons of war which should be obtained by the inhabitants of the cities of Israel. So huge should be the quantity of weapons left behind by the slain, that the Israelites should <span class="cmt_word">burn them with fire seven years</span>. This burning of the weapons has been explained by Havernick, on the ground that weapons of war, as incompatible with Messianic times, should be no more required (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>); by Ewald, as in accordance with the custom of the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>) and other ancient peoples (Livy, 38:23; Virgil, 'AEneid,' 8:562); by Hitzig and Smend, as prompted by the consideration that Israel, for whom Jehovah had fought, should have no further need of weapons; by Schroder, as indicating that for Israel these warlike instruments should then so completely lose their power to terrify that they might be looked upon simply as so much firewood; and by Keil, as designed to annihilate the enemy and remove every trace of him. Kliefoth appears nearest the mark, in suggesting that the emphasis lies upon the length of time the burning should continue; and that this was intended, by conveying an idea of the vastness of the spoil, to represent the thoroughness of Gog's destruction and of Israel's deliverance. That the whole delineation is symbolical appears from the number of years the weapons are said to serve for fuel, viz. seven, and from the character of the weapons themselves, which, if not entirely wooden, were at least all combustible. Of the "armor" generally (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>, "something joined," from a root signifying "to join") the pieces mentioned - <span class="cmt_word">the shields and the bucklers</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>), <span class="cmt_word">the bows and arrows</span> (see ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">the hand-staves</span>, or, <span class="accented">javelins</span> (margin), perhaps, as Hitzig and Smend suggest, the staff with which a horseman strikes his beast (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-27.htm">Numbers 22:27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and the spears</span> - were mostly composed of timber. When all should have been given to the flames, it would then appear that on their late owners the <span class="accented">lex talionis</span> had worked out its literal avengement, that they who had intended to despoil Israel were themselves spoiled; and they who hoped to plunder Israel were themselves plundered (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-10 The Lord will make the most careless and hardened transgressors know his holy name, either by his righteous anger, or by the riches of his mercy and grace. The weapons formed against Zion shall not prosper. Though this prophecy is to be fulfilled in the latter days, it is certain. From the language used, it seems that the army of Gog will be destroyed by miracle.</body></html>
