It simply denotes some (probably imaginary) thoroughfare, which is to be blocked up by the buried bodies of the slain. No definite locality is assigned to it, except that it is "on the east of the sea," meaning the Dead Sea. It was to be, therefore, on the extreme south-eastern outskirts of the land. This is another of the features of the description which indicate some other than a literal interpretation; for how should such a host, invading the land from the north for purposes of plunder, be found in that locality, and how could such vast numbers of dead bodies be transported thither?<p><span class= "bld">Stop the noses.</span>--The word "noses" is not in the original, and should be omitted. The meaning is simply that the bodies of the host shall so fill up the valley as to stop the way of travellers.<p><span class= "bld">The valley of Hamon-gog.--</span>It is better to translate the word Hamon, as in the margin: <span class= "ital">The valley of the multitude of Gog.</span> So also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-15.htm" title="And the passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.">Ezekiel 39:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16</span> contain a second proof of the completeness of Gog's destruction, viz. the length of time occupied in burying the slain and cleansing the land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Gog, who should invade Israel in the hope of acquiring the entire mastery of her land, would obtain at Jehovah's hands only <span class="cmt_word">a place there of graves</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either, as Hitzig, Ewald, Keil, and Smend suggest, a place where a grave might be possible - a place large enough to receive his slaughtered carcasses; or as Havernick proposes, "an altogether special grave as no other in Israel;" or as Schroder interprets, "a place where there is a grave for him and nothing else." Concerning both the designation and the site of this divinely provided sepulcher controversy has arisen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">As to its site</span>. The notion of Michaelis and Eiehhom, that <span class="cmt_word">the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea</span> was in some way related to the mountains of Abarim mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>, and that of Hitzig, that it signified "the valley of the opposite heights," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-3.htm">1 Samuel 17:3</a>, and was to be sought for in the "very great valley" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, may at once be dismissed - the former as untenable, and -the latter as far-fetched. The suggestion of Hengstenberg and Kliefoth, that by the burial-place of Gog was meant the valley of Megiddo, where Josiah fell in battle against Pharaoh-Necho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>), derives support from these considerations, that the very name of Megiddo points to battles, that in its vicinity are found such passes as are here described, and that its modern designation <span class="accented">Lejun</span> (<span class="accented">Leqio</span>), in all probability contains a reminiscence of the present passage. It is, however, open to the obvious objections that the place of Gog's burial was not contiguous to the field of his overthrow, and that the clause locating it "on the <span class="accented">east of the sea</span>," by which on this hypothesis must be understood the Mediterranean, is rather descriptive of the entire land than of any particular spot therein. Hence the view of Havernick, Ewald, Keil, and Smoud, which finds the valley in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea, is to be preferred, though, even with agreement as to this, interpreters are not unanimous as to the spot intended. Ewald thinks of "the horrible, unwholesome valley over against the sea, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>) the Dead Sea, that valley which covers the ancient overbearing ones (<span class="accented">die Zerreisenden</span>), the Sodomites, who resemble these;" Keil, translating <span class="accented">kidmath</span> as "in front of," holds by "the valley of the Jordan above the Dead Sea;" Havernick and Smend advocate "a place outside the Holy Land," though the clause, "a grave in Israel," seems against this. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' hints, net without reason, that the valley was "imaginary." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">As to its designation</span>. That in the word "passengers" lies a paronomasia is apparent; but whether threefold or only twofold is uncertain. In the present verse <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> may signify either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> such travelers as were wont to pass through the valley (Keil), which is the obvious and natural interpretation; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the warriors of Gog (Ewald, Hitzig), who intended to pass through the land, but whose invasion had only proved a passing storm; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the commissioners who should be appointed to pass through the land in search of bones (ver. 15). The notion of Ewald, who derives <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and translates "haughty," "overbearing," meaning the Gogites, is countenanced by no ether expositor. If the first sense be taken, then the verse will read, "The valley of the passers through, and it (the valley, in consequence of having become the grave of Gog) stops (the way of) the passers through;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it becomes thereafter impassable for travelers (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil); or, it stops the noses, or breath, of such travelers by reason of its horrible stench (Ewald, Havernick). If the second meaning be selected, the valley must be understood to have afterwards received its name from the fact that Gog's warriors lay entombed beneath its sod, and "the stopping of the passengers" to signify that whereas Gog purposed to overrun the land, his destructive career was there ignominiously arrested (Schroder). If the third rendering be preferred, then the valley will be held to have derived its designation, after the event, from the passing through it or through the land of the searchers, in which case the stepping of the passengers can only have alluded to the fact that, as the "buriers" proceeded with the work of interment, they were compelled to turn away their faces and stop their noses because of the noisome effluvium which arose from the corpses. The first interpretation is the best, though the first and second might be combined by making the first "passengers" stand for the travelers and the second for the invaders, whose career should there be stopped; and to this view a certain countenance is lent by the statements which follow, that there should <span class="cmt_word">Gog and all his multitude</span> - literally, <span class="accented">all his noisy tumult - be</span> buried, and that the valley ever afterwards should bear the name of <span class="cmt_word">Hamon-gog</span>, or, <span class="accented">Gog</span> <span class="accented">s multitude</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:11-22 How numerous the enemies which God destroyed for the defence of his people Israel! Times of great deliverances should be times of reformation. Every one should help the utmost he can, toward cleansing the land from reproach. Sin is an enemy every man should strive against. Those engaged in public work, especially of cleansing and reforming a land, ought to be men who will go through with what they undertake, who will be always employed. When good work is to be done, every one should further it. Having received special favours from God, let us cleanse ourselves from all evil. It is a work which will require persevering diligence, that search may be made into the secret recesses of sin. The judgments of the Lord, brought upon sin and sinners, are a sacrifice to the justice of God, and a feast to the faith and hope of God's people. See how evil pursues sinners, even after death. After all that ambitious and covetous men do and look for, a place of graves is all the Lord gives them on earth, while their guilty souls are doomed to misery in another world.</body></html>
