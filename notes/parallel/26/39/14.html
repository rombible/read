It implies that this occupation is to be one of long continuance, and the fact that they are to search the land through for the remains shows that the army of Gog is not conceived of as perishing when collected in one place, but when distributed all over the land. This search is only to begin after the close of the burying for seven months already described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - When the work of burying Gog should have gone on for seven months, at the end of that time the Israelites should sever out (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>) <span class="cmt_word">men of continual employment</span>; literally, men <span class="accented">of con-</span>t/nuance; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> persons hired for a continuous work or devoted to a constant occupation, whose business it should be <span class="cmt_word">passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain</span> - or, as the Revised Version reads, <span class="accented">to bury them that pass through</span>, <span class="accented">that remain - upon</span> the face of the land. Here, again, the old play upon the word "passengers" recurs, and with it two or three difficulties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is not clear whether the commissioners consisted of two classes of officers, "passers through," or "searchers," who scoured the land in search of unburied skeletons or bones, which, however, they did not bury; and "buriers" proper, who, accompanying these searchers, conducted the interment of such skeletons or bones as were found (Hengstenberg, Keil); or whether the commissioners were only one body, who both searched and buried (Ewald and Smend). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is doubtful whether the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> should be taken as the sign of the accusative, and the clause translated as in the Revised Version, in which case the "passengers" that should be buried could only be the "invaders" as above (see ver. 11); or as a preposition, in which case the rendering of the Authorized Version must stand, and the "passengers" be regarded as the "searchers." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is open to debate whether ver. 14 should not close with the initial words of ver. 15, as Ewald proposes, "And the passengers shall search and pass through in the land;" or at least whether the first clause in ver. 15 should not form an independent sentence, thus: "And they that pass through in the land shall pass through," as in the Revised Version, in which case the sighting of unburied bones (ver. 15) would not necessarily be the work of "searchers," but of any one, the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> being impersonal. It is impossible to decide dogmatically in a question of so much difficulty; but the Revised Version appears to present the most exact rendering of the Hebrew, and upon the whole the most intelligible account of what was intended to take place, viz. the appointment of a special body of commissioners, who should be designated both "passengers," in ironical allusion to Gog who had meant to pass through the land, and "buffers," from the nature of the task delegated to them, viz. the interment of the "passengers," i.e. the Gogites, and who should begin their work after the main body of the slain had been removed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the end of the seven months of burying. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:11-22 How numerous the enemies which God destroyed for the defence of his people Israel! Times of great deliverances should be times of reformation. Every one should help the utmost he can, toward cleansing the land from reproach. Sin is an enemy every man should strive against. Those engaged in public work, especially of cleansing and reforming a land, ought to be men who will go through with what they undertake, who will be always employed. When good work is to be done, every one should further it. Having received special favours from God, let us cleanse ourselves from all evil. It is a work which will require persevering diligence, that search may be made into the secret recesses of sin. The judgments of the Lord, brought upon sin and sinners, are a sacrifice to the justice of God, and a feast to the faith and hope of God's people. See how evil pursues sinners, even after death. After all that ambitious and covetous men do and look for, a place of graves is all the Lord gives them on earth, while their guilty souls are doomed to misery in another world.</body></html>
