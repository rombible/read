but even this promise is mingled with predictions which still look on to the then distant future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-29.</span> - This section Hengstenberg regards as the close of the whole system of prophecies of a predominantly comforting character from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a> onwards;" Keil views it as the proper conclusion to the prophecy concerning Gog and the series of predictions from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1</a> onwards. It is in substance a recapitulation of God's gracious promise to bring again the captivity of Israel, of which the prophet had just been reminded in ver. 23, and to which accordingly he now in thought goes back. It traces the whole course of the Divine dealings with the nation from the point of the exile onwards. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will bring again the captivity of Jacob</span>. (For the use of "Jacob" as a designation of the people, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>.) The promise goes back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-23.htm">Jeremiah 31:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>; and other passages. That its fulfillment began with the return from Babylon is not inconsistent with the view that its fulfillment will terminate with the final ingathering of Israel out of the nations by her conversion to Christianity, and her consequent admission to the Church. That its first cause will be "mercy" to the whole house of Israel will not prevent that cause from being at the same time a jealous regard for the Divine holiness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21, 22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:23-29 When the Lord shall have mercy on the whole house of Israel, by converting them to Christianity, and when they shall have borne the shame of being cast off for their sins, then the nations shall learn to know, worship, and serve him. Then Israel also shall know the Lord, as revealed in and by Christ. Past events do not answer to these predictions. The pouring out of the Spirit is a pledge that God's favour will continue. He will hide his face no more from those on whom he has poured out his Spirit. When we pray that God would never cast us from his presence, we must as earnestly pray that, in order thereto, he would never take his Holy Spirit from us.</body></html>
