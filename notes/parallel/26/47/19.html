Tamar has been identified with Kurnub, a ruined village some twenty-five miles west of the southern end of the Dead Sea; but as the old boundary certainly went far to the south of this and as the next place mentioned is Kadesh, about thirty miles nearly south from the Dead Sea, the Tamar here meant is more probably some place not yet identified. Kadesh, known from the "waters of strife" as <span class= "ital">Meribah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/20-3.htm" title="And the people strived with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would God that we had died when our brothers died before the LORD!">Numbers 20:3-14</a>), is called Kadesh-barnea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-4.htm" title="And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:">Numbers 34:4</a>. It has been identified by Robinson with the <span class= "ital">Ain-el-Weibeh,</span> about thirty miles slightly west of south from the Dead Sea. Its exact situation, however, is somewhat doubtful.<p><span class= "bld">The river to the great sea.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">riverward to the great sea.</span> From Kadesh the boundary was to strike across the mountainous desert to what is often called in Scripture "the river of Egypt," and was anciently known as the <span class= "ital">Rhinocolura,</span> now called the <span class= "ital">Wady-el-Arish.</span> It followed this to the Mediterranean. The length of the southern boundary, following the curve of the Rhinocolura, must have been nearly 100 miles, or about eighty-seven miles from east to west.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">The south boundary</span>.

Different from Hazezon-Tamar, or Engedi (ver. 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>), which lay too far up the west side of the sea, Tamar can hardly be identified either with the <span class="accented">Tamar</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a> near Tadmor in the wilderness, or with the <span class="accented">Thamara</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) of Eusebius between Hebron and Elath, supposed by Robinson ('Bibl.

Proceeding westward, the southern boundary should reach to <span class="cmt_word">the waters of strife in Kadesh</span>; better, to the <span class="accented">waters of Meribotk Kadesh</span>. These were in the Desert of Sin, near Kadesh-Barnea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>), which, again, was on the road from Hebron to Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>). The exact site, however, of Kadesh-Barnea is matter of dispute; Rowland and Keil find it in the spring '<span class="accented">Ain Kades</span>, at the north-west corner of the mountain-land of Azazimeh, which stretches on the south of Palestine from the south-south-west to the north-north-east, and forms the watershed Between the Mediterranean and the Arabah valley. Delitzsch and Conder seek it in the neighborhood of the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Jemen</span>, on the south-east side of the above watershed, and on the road from Mount Hot. Robinson ('Bibl. Rea,' 2:582) discovers it in '<span class="accented">Ain-el-Weibeh</span>, not far from Petra. A writer (Sin., Smend?) in Riehm ('Handworterbuch des Biblischen Alterthums,' art. "Kades") pleads for a site on the west side of the Azazimeh plateau, and in the vicinity of the road by Shur to Egypt. Leaving Kadesh, the boundary should continue to <span class="cmt_word">the river</span>, or, <span class="accented">brook</span>, of Egypt, and thence extend to <span class="cmt_word">the great sea</span>, or Mediterranean. The punctuation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which makes the word signify "lot,' must be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, so as to mean "river," since the reference manifestly is to the torrent of Egypt, the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Arish</span>, on the borders of Palestine and Egypt, which enters the Mediterranean near Rhinocorura (<span class="greek">&#x1fec;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a> it is called the river of Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">And this is the south side southward</span> (see on ver. 17). The correspondence between this line and that of the earlier chart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4, 5</a>) is once more apparent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
