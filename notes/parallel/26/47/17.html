Hazar-enan means "the village of springs," and is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the tribes.

For "and the border of Hamath," read <span class= "ital">even the border--i.e.,</span> the northern boundary is the (south) boundary of Hamath. While it is impossible to locate precisely this northern boundary, either as given in Numbers or by Ezekiel, it is evident that the two are identical, and that the line stretched from the Mediterranean to the territory of Damascus. The whole width of the country at this point would therefore be somewhat over thirty miles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The northern boundary is further defined as extending <span class="cmt_word">from the sea,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Mediterranean on the west, to <span class="cmt_word">Hazar-enan</span>, or the "Village of fountains," in the east, which village again is declared to have been <span class="cmt_word">the border</span>, frontier city (Keil), at the border (Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">of Damascus</span>, and as having on the north northward the border or territory of Hamath.

Compared with the ancient north boundary of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-7.htm">Numbers 34:7-9</a>), this appointed by Ezekiel's Torah for the new land shows a marked correspondence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
