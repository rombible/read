These trees with their supernatural virtues are represented as produced by the waters because "they issued out of the sanctuary," thus presenting a most effective image of the life-giving power of those spiritual influences which come from God upon men.<p>It has been objected to the spiritual interpretation of this vision, that under it nothing can be made of the fishermen of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand on it from Engedi even to Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.">Ezekiel 47:10</a>, and that, therefore, the whole is to be considered as a glorification of nature in the future Palestine. But this is to forget that in every figure and parable there are, and must be, details necessary to the figure which have nothing answering to them in the thing signified, and that it is the habit of Ezekiel to carry out such details very far. In this case, the mention of the fishermen greatly heightens the imagery of the life-giving power of the waters; while, if the whole were to be literally understood, they would really have no place, because there would be no such fishermen in the supposed glorified condition of the land.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.">Ezekiel 47:13-23</a>, which, as already said, properly belong to Ezekiel 48, give the boundaries of the land to be divided among the tribes, together with provision for the inheritance of strangers living among them. The tracing of the boundary itself is introduced by some general statements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.">Ezekiel 47:13-14</a>, concerning the distribution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The effect of the river upon the vegetation growing on its banks is the last feature added to the prophet's picture.

The "very many trees" of that verse become in this <span class="cmt_word">all trees</span>, or every tree <span class="cmt_word">for meat</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every sort of tree with edible fruit (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>), whose leaf should not fade or wither, and whose fruit should not be consumed or finished, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> should not fail, but continue to bring forth <span class="cmt_word">new fruit</span>, i.e., early or firstfruits (Revised Version margin), <span class="cmt_word">according to his</span> (or, its) <span class="cmt_word">months</span>; or, <span class="accented">every month</span>; the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> being taken distributively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a> (compare <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "every day," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-13.htm">Ezekiel 46:13</a>). This remarkable productivity, the prophet saw, was due, not so much to the fact that the tree roots sucked up moisture from the stream, as to the circumstance that the waters which they drank up <span class="cmt_word">issued out of the sanctuary.</span> To the same circumstance were owing the nutritive and medicinal properties of their fruit and leaves respectively. The picture in this verse is unmistakably based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>, and is as clearly reproduced by the Apocalyptic seer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>. On this whole vision the remarks of Thomson, in 'The Land and the Book' (pp. 660-663), are worthy of being consulted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
