The Dead Sea at the southern end is very shallow, and beyond there is an extensive tract of very low land. In the season of the flood of the Jordan this is overflowed to a considerable distance, and as the river subsides, is again left bare and encrusted with salt from the evaporation of the water. This allusion, therefore, shows plainly that the prophet did not have in mind a flowing on of the river through the <span class= "ital">Arabah,</span> or valley leading from the Dead to the Red Sea, and that the effect of the life-giving waters should cease where the waters themselves ceased to flow; at the same time, in the thing symbolised, it shows that we are not to expect, as the effect of the Gospel, a perfect and universal obedience to its teachings. Man is still left free to hear or forbear, and the world must be expected always to contain its unhealed miry and marshy places.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The miry places thereof</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> an incorrect reading for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, the plural with suffix of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "a marsh, or swamp," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21</a>) <span class="cmt_word">and the marshes thereof</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;</span>, "its pools and sloughs" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>, where the term-signifies a reservoir for water, or cistern), were the low tracts of land upon the borders of the Dead Sea, which in the rainy season, when its waters overflowed, became covered with pools (see Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.,' 2:225). These, according to the prophet, should not be healed (better than, "and that which shall not be healed," as in the margin of the Authorized Text), obviously because the waters of the temple-river should not reach them, but should be <span class="cmt_word">given to salt</span>. When the waters of the above-mentioned pools have been dried up or evaporated, they leave behind them a deposit of salt (see Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.,' 2:226), and Canon Driver ('Literature of the Old Testament,' p. 276), following Smend, conceives that the above-named miry places and marshes in the vicinity of the Dead Sea were to be allowed to remain as they were on account of the excellent salt which they furnished. (On the supposed (!) excellence of the salt derived from the Dead Sea, Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 616, may be consulted.) If this, however, were the correct import of the prophet's words, then the clause would describe an additional blessing to be enjoyed by the land, viz. that the temple-river would not be permitted to spoil its "salt-pans;" but the manifest intention of the prophet was to indicate a limitation to the life-giving influence of the river, and to signify that places and persons unvisited by its healing stream would be abandoned to incurable destruction. "To give to salt" is in Scripture never expressive of blessing, but always of judgment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
