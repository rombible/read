So far the course of the river has been due east; now, without any allusion to the Jordan, it apparently takes its place and flows into the sea. Both the situation and the description show that the Dead Sea is intended. By its entrance "the waters of the sea shall be healed," that is, they shall be so changed that, from being incapable of supporting life, they shall become the home of life in all abundance and variety (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every thing that lives, which moves, wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live where the river comes.">Ezekiel 47:9-10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Toward the east country</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the east circle</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> this case probably "the region about Jordan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10, 11</a>), above the Dead Sea, where the valley or <span class="accented">ghor</span> widens out into a bread basin, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>). The LXX. render, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, designing by this, however (presumably), only to Graecize the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> as they do with the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">desert</span>, or, <span class="accented">plain</span>, which they translate by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. The Arabah signified the low, sterile valley into which the Jordan runs near Jericho, in which are the Dead Sea (hence called "the sea of the Arabah," <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>), and the brook Kedron, or "river of the Arabah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>), and which extends as far south as the head of the Elanitic gulf. The whole region is described by Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:596) as one of extreme desolation - a character which belonged to it in ancient times (Josephus, 'Wars,' 3:10. 7; 4:8. 2). The part of this Arabah into which the waters flowed was situated north of <span class="cmt_word">the sea</span>, clearly not the Mediterranean, but the Dead Sea, "the sea of the Arabah," as above stated, and the "eastern sea" as afterwards named (ver. 18), into which they ultimately flowed. The clause, which being <span class="cmt_word">brought forth into the sea</span>, may either be connected with the proceeding words or formed into an independent sentence. Among those who adopt the former construction a variety of renderings prevails. The LXX. reads, "(And the water) comes to the sea (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), to the sea of the pouring out," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Dead Sea, into which the river debouches. With this Havernick agrees, rendering, "to the sea of that outflow." Ewald reads, "into the sea of muddy waters," meaning the Dead Sea. Kimchi, "into the sea where the waters are brought forth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the ocean (the Mediterranean), whoso waters go forth to encompass the world. Hengstenberg, Kliefoth, Keil, and Currey, who adopt the latter construction, borrow <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> from the antecedent clause, and translate, "To the sea (come or go) the waters that have been brought forth;" with which accords the Revised Version. The last words record the effect which should be produced by their entering into the sea. <span class="cmt_word">The waters shall be healed</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rendered salubrious, from being hurtful (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-22.htm">2 Kings 2:22</a>). The translation of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is inaccurate. The unwholesome character of the Dead Sea is described by Tacitus: "Lucius <span class="accented">immenso ambitu</span>, <span class="accented">specie maris sapore corruptior</span>, <span class="accented">gravitate odoris accolis pestifer</span>, <span class="accented">neque vento impellitar neque pisces ant suetas aquis volucres patitur"</span> ('Hist.,' 5:6). Yon Raumer (p. 61) writes, "The sea is celled Dead, because there is in it no green plant, no water-fowl in it, no fish, no shell. If the Jordan carry fish into it, they die." "According to the testimony of all antiquity and of most modern travelers," says Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:226), "there exists within the waters of the Dead Sea no living thing, no trace, indeed, of animal or vegetable life. Our own experience goes to confirm the truth of this testimony. We perceived no sign of life within the waters." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
