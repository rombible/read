And this is the east side.">Ezekiel 47:18</a>, is used in a wider sense than the classic <span class= "ital">Auranitis,</span> and includes also Gaulanitis (Golan), and Batan?a (Bashan), in fact the whole land between the territories of Damascus and Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm" title="And the east side you shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border to the east sea. And this is the east side.">Ezekiel 47:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The four names here mentioned belong to towns or places lying on the road to Zedad, and stretching from west to east. <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span>, called also Hamath the Great (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>), situated on the Orontes, north of Hermon and Antilibanus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>), was the capital of a kingdom to which also belonged Riblah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>). Originally colonized by the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), it became in David's time a flourishing kingdom under Toi, who formed an alliance with the Hebrew sore-reign against Hadadezer of Zoba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-9.htm">1 Chronicles 18:9</a>). It was subsequently conquered by the King of Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a>). Winer thinks it never belonged to Israel; but Schurer cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3, 4</a> to show that at least in Solomon's reign it was temporarily annexed to the empire of David's son. In Ezekiel's chart the territory of united Israel should extend, not to the town of Hamath, but to the southern boundary of the land of Hamath. <span class="cmt_word">Berothah</span> was probably the same as Berothai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>), afterwards called Chun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a>), if <span class="accented">Chun</span> is not a textual corruption. The town in question cannot be identified either with the modern <span class="accented">Beirut</span> on the Phoenician coast (Conder), since it must have lain west of Hamath, and therefore at a considerable distance from the sea; or with <span class="accented">Birtha</span>, the present day <span class="accented">El-Bir</span>, or <span class="accented">Birah</span>, on the east bank of the Euphrates, which is too far east; or with the Galilaean Berotha, near Kadesh (Josephus), as this is too far south; but must be sought for between Hamath and Damascus, and most likely close to the former. <span class="cmt_word">Sibraim</span>, occurring here only, may, on the other hand, be assumed to have lain nearer Damascus, and may, perhaps, be identified with Ziphron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-9.htm">Numbers 34:9</a>), though the site of this town cannot be where Wetstein placed it, at <span class="accented">Zifran</span>, north-east of Damascus, and on the road to Palmyra. Smend compares it with <span class="accented">Sepharvaim</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Damascus</span> was the well-known capital of Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>), and the principal emporium of commerce between East and West Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a>). Its high antiquity is testified by both Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-15.htm">Genesis 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>) and the cuneiform inscriptions, in which it appears as <span class="accented">Dimaski</span> and <span class="accented">Dimaska</span> (Schrader, ' Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament,' p. 138). <span class="cmt_word">Hazar-hatticon</span>; or, the <span class="accented">middle Hazar</span>, was probably so styled to distinguish it from Hazar-enan (ver. 17). (On the import of Hatticon, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-28.htm">Exodus 26:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a>, in both of which places it signifies "the middle.") The word Hazar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), "an enclosure," or "place fenced off," was employed to denote villages or townships, of which at least six are mentioned in Scripture (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Hauran</span>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), "Cave-land," so called because of the number of its caverns, was most likely designed to designate "the whole tract of land between Damascus and the country of Gilead" (Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
