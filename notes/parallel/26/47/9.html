This peculiar form has occasioned some perplexity, especially because in the vision of Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>) the waters are represented as divided, half of them flowing to the Dead Sea and half of them to the Mediterranean. It is plain, however, that but one river is intended here, flowing into the Dead Sea. Possibly there is an allusion in the dual form to the Jordan flowing with it into the sea; but this vision throughout pays so little regard to the natural features of the country that it seems more likely that the dual form is simply used to express the greatness of the river, "a double river." By a division of the word and a slight change in the vowels the expression would become "river of the sea," that is, flowing into the sea.<p><span class= "bld">Shall live.</span>--This is to be understood as a pregnant expression; all kinds of life shall spring into being whithersoever the waters come. The same thing is emphatically repeated at the close of the verse, and in the intermediate clause the same thought is expressed by the "very great multitude of fish."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The nature of the healing is next described as an impartation of such celebrity to the waters that <span class="cmt_word">everything that liveth, which moveth</span> - better, <span class="accented">every</span> <span class="accented">living creature which swarmeth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">whitherseover the rivers</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the two rivers</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall come, shall live</span>. The meaning cannot be that everything which liveth and swarmeth in the sea whither the rivers come shall live, because the Dead Sea contains no fish (see above), but whithersoever the rivers come, there living and swarming creatures of every kind shall spring into existence, shall come to life and flourish. The dual form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, has been accounted for by Maurer, as having been selected on account of its resemblance to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>; by H&auml;vernick and Currey, as pointing to the junction of another river, the Kedron (H&auml;vernick), the Jordan (Currey), with the temple-stream before the latter, should fall into the sea; by Kliefoth, as alluding to a division of the river waters after entering the sea; by Neumann and Schroder, as referring to the waters of the sea and the waters of the river, which should henceforth be united; and by Hengstenberg, with whom Keil and Plumptre agree, as a dual of intensification (as in Jeremiah 1:21), signifying "double river," with allusion to its greatness, or the strength of its current. None of these interpretations is free from objection; though probably, in default of better, the last is best. Ewald changes the dual into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, a singular with a suffix, while Hitzig makes of it a plural; but neither of these devices is satisfactory. As a further evidence that the waters of the sea should be healed by the inflowing into them of the waters of the river, it is stated that the sea should thereafter contain <span class="cmt_word">a very great multitude of fish</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and the fish will be very many</span>), of which previously it contained none. The next clauses supply the reason of this abundance of fish, <span class="cmt_word">because these waters</span> (of the river) <span class="cmt_word">shall</span> - or, <span class="accented">are</span> (Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">come thither</span> - (into the waters of the sea), <span class="cmt_word">for</span> (literally, and) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they</span>, the latter, <span class="cmt_word">shall be</span> (or, <span class="accented">are</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>healed, and everything shall live</span> (or, connecting this with the foregoing clause, <span class="accented">and everything shall be healed</span>, <span class="accented">and live</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whithersoever the river cometh</span> - the river, namely, that proceedeth from the temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
