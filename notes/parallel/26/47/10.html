En-eglaim occurs only here, and has not been certainly identified. St. Jerome speaks of "Engallim" as at the junction of the Jordan with the sea, and near this point there is a fountain now known as <span class= "ital">Ain-el-Feshkhah.</span> Others consider that the dual form of the name indicates "one of the double cities of Moab," thus placing it on the eastern side of the sea, and this seems more probable, since the expression would then be equivalent to "the whole breadth of the sea." Everywhere they shall stretch their nets, and the variety and abundance of the fish shall be as great as in "the great sea," that is, the Mediterranean. This whole verse in regard to the fishermen is a striking illustration of Ezekiel's way of carrying out the most ideal description into detail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - As another consequence of the inflowing of this river into the Dead Sea, it is stated that <span class="cmt_word">the fishers</span> (rather, <span class="accented">fishers</span>, without the article) should stand upon its banks, <span class="cmt_word">from Engedi, even unto Englaim; there shall be a place to spread forth nets.</span> The Revised Version more correctly renders, <span class="accented">fishers shall stand by it</span>; <span class="accented">from Engedi even unto Eneglaim</span>, <span class="accented">shall be a place for the spreading of nets</span>; or, more literally, a place <span class="accented">of spreading</span>, <span class="accented">out for nets</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-5.htm">Ezekiel 26:5</a>).

Res.,' 2:214), was situated in the middle of the west coast of the Dead Sea, and not at its southern extremity, as Jerome supposed. Englaim, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, signifying "Fountain of two calves," was located by Jerome, who cars it <span class="accented">En Gallim</span>, at the northern extremity of the Dead Sea, and is usually identified with the modern '<span class="accented">Ain Feshkhah</span>, or "Fountain of mist," at the northern end of the west coast, where the ruins of houses and a small tower have been discovered (Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.,' 2:220). Ewald cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-8.htm">Isaiah 15:8</a> to show that Englaim was on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, which, Smend notes, was given up by the prophet to the sons of the East. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
