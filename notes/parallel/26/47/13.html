(For the verb, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-18.htm">Numbers 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">According to the twelve tribes</span>. This presupposed that at least representatives of the twelve tribes would return from exile; but it is doubtful if this can be proved from Scripture to have taken place, which once more shows that a literal interpretation of this temple-vision cannot be consistently carried through. Smend observes that the word commonly employed in the priest-cede to denote "tribes" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-1.htm">Numbers 30:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-14.htm">Joshua 22:14</a>), which is never used by Ezekiel, who habitually selects, as here, the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-19.htm">Ezekiel 37:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a>), which also was not unknown to the priest-cede (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-14.htm">Exodus 39:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-2.htm">Numbers 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-9.htm">Joshua 22:9, 10, 11, 13</a>). That is to say, if the priest-cede existed before Ezekiel, he had the choice of both terms, and selected <span class="accented">shebhet</span>; whereas if Ezekiel existed before the priest-cede, and prepared the way for it, the author of the latter rejected Ezekiel's word <span class="accented">shebhet</span>, and adopted another perfectly unknown to the prophet. This fact appears to point to a dependence of Ezekiel on the priest-cede rather than of the priest-cede on Ezekiel. <span class="cmt_word">Joseph</span> shall have two <span class="cmt_word">portions</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Joseph portions</span>, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is not <span class="accented">dual</span>. Yet that two were intended is undoubted (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14, 17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
