There is also more detail given in Numbers, and as the points mentioned here are the same, it is fair to fill out this description from the earlier one. It is remarkable that in both cases the eastern boundary is the Jordan. The inheritance of the tribes on the east of that river having been a modification of the original allotment, and not being taken into consideration at all here, portions are assigned on the west of the river to the two and a half tribes who had lived all through Israel's history on the east.<p><span class= "bld">The way of Hethlon.--</span>The boundary begins at the Mediterranean, but at what precise point cannot be determined; for although it is evident that the lines between the tribes were straight and parallel, yet it does not appear whether they were perpendicular to the Jordan, which would be substantially parallel to the lines of latitude, or perpendicular to the Mediterranean, which would make a small angle with them. <span class= "ital">Hethlon</span> is mentioned only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the tribes.

It was probably a place of little importance, as its situation is described "as men <span class= "ital">go</span> to Zedad." The latter place is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm" title="From mount Hor you shall point out your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:">Numbers 34:8</a> as one of the points in the original northern border of the land. It is clear from the passage in Numbers that it lay eastward of the "entrance to Hamath," and has been identified by some writers with the modern village of <span class= "ital">Sadad,</span> but this is thirty miles from "the entrance of Hamath," which seems quite too far. Ezekiel may have passed through it when carried captive to Babylon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">The north boundary</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side</span>. The Revised Version follows Kliefoth and Keil in detaching the last clause from the preceding words, and reading. This shall <span class="accented">be the border of the land</span>: <span class="accented">on the north side</span>. <span class="cmt_word">From the great sea</span>, the Mediterranean, <span class="cmt_word">by the way of Hethlon, as men go to</span> (or, unto <span class="accented">the entering in of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Zedad</span>. The former of these places (<span class="accented">Chethlon</span>), which is again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a>, has not yet been identified, though Currey suggests for the "way," "the defile between the ranges of Lebanus and Antilibanus, from the sea to Hamath." The latter (Zedad) Wetstein and Robinson find in the city of <span class="accented">Sadad</span> (<span class="accented">Sudud</span>), east of the road leading from Damascus to Humo (Emesa), and therefore west of Hamath; but as Hamath in all probability lay to the east of Zedad, this opinion must be rejected. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-23 These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.</body></html>
