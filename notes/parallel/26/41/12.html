Nothing is here said of the purposes of this other building; but it is probably "the appointed place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm" title="You shall take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.">Ezekiel 43:21</a>) for the burning of the sin-offering, and also of any remains of other sacrifices which required to be consumed by fire, and of any other refuse from the Temple. Its total width of 80 cubits (70 cubits + 2 walls of 5 cubits each) leaves a passage-way of 10 cubits on each side; while its length (90 cubits + two walls of 5 cubits each--100 cubits) Just fills the space from "the separate place" to the wall of the court. (See plan II., G. [<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/40-44.htm" title="And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.">Ezekiel 40:44-49</a>]) The sum-total of the exterior measurements is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/41-13.htm" title="So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;">Ezekiel 41:13-14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">separate place</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The building that was before the separate place. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, occurring only in this chapter, and translated "separate place," is derived from a root signifying to "cut <span class="accented">off</span>," and here denotes a space behind the temple on the west, which was marked off from the rest of the ground on which the temple with its courts and chambers stood, and devoted most likely to less sacred purposes. Behind Solomon's temple lay a similar space (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a>), with buildings upon it and a separate way out; and as the name gizrah appears to convey the <span class="accented">notion</span> of something that required to be kept apart and removed from the sacred precincts, the opinion of Kliefoth is probably correct that "this space with its buildings was to be used for the reception of all refuse, sweepings, all kinds of rubbish - in brief, of everything that was separated or rejected when the holy service was performed in the temple, and that this was the reason why it received the name of 'the separate place.' The dimensions of this building were <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the breadth, seventy cubits; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the length, ninety cubits; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the thickness of the wall, five cubits round about. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers. 13, 14.</span> - Thus the whole breadth of this erection was seventy <span class="accented">plus</span> ten, or eighty cubits; which, with ten cubits of free space on the north and south sides, make a hundred cubits in all. Its whole length was ninety <span class="accented">plus</span> ten, or a hundred cubits. The entire area was thus once more a hundred cubits square.
