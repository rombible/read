These chambers were exactly like those surrounding Solomon's Temple, except that they were one cubit narrower, and the description of them is made clearer by a comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/6-5.htm" title="And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:">1Kings 6:5-10</a>. The Greek version says that there was a space between these chambers and the wall of the house, and several interpreters have followed this explanation; but this is quite inconsistent with the language of the original, and would involve an inner wall for the chambers, of which there is no mention, and for which no space is allowed.<p><span class= "bld">Entered into the wall </span>. . . <span class= "bld">but</span> <span class= "bld">they had not hold.</span>--More exactly, <span class= "ital">they came upon the wall.</span> The "house" cannot without violence be understood of anything but the Temple itself. The construction was the same as in Solomon's Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-6.htm" title="The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.">1Kings 6:6</a>), the wall receding with each storey of the chambers, thus leaving a ledge on which the beams should rest, "that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house."<p>Nothing is said of the distribution of these chambers, but, as will be seen by the plan, a uniform size requires that they should be placed twelve on each side, and six at the end of the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The side chambers were t<span class="cmt_word">hree, one over another, and thirty in order</span>; literally, side chamber over side <span class="accented">chamber</span>, <span class="accented">three and thirty times</span>; which means that they were ranged in three stories of thirty each; in this, again, agreeing, as to number and position, with the chambers in Solomon's temple (see Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:03. 2). It is not needful to alter the text, as Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, and Ewald propose to do, in order to make it read, with the LXX., "chamber against chamber, thirty and (this) three times," on the ground that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is the preposition, because in Ezekiel <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> often stands for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>). How the chambers were arranged along the three sides is not stated; but most likely there were twelve threes on each of the longer sides, the north and the south, and six threes on the shorter or western side. Like the chambers in Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). those in Ezekiel's were not fastened to "the wall of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the temple proper; the only question is whether they were built against the temple wall, as Kliefoth, Keil, Smend, and Schroder suppose, or, as Ewald and Dr. Currey seem to think, against another wall, five cubits thick (ver. 9), which ran parallel to the temple wall, and which, having been built expressly for the support of the side chambers, might properly enough be said to be "of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> belonging to it. In the former case the chambers would doubtless be fastened to the temple wall by means of "ledges," "holds," "rebates," as in the temple of Solomon: in the latter case, as Ewald translates, there would be "a light passage between the wall of the house and the side chambers around." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-26 After the prophet had observed the courts, he was brought to the temple.
