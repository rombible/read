The expression "length" in its repetition is generally thought to mean (by a slight change in the text) "the stand" or "base." <span class= "ital">Table</span> and <span class= "ital">altar</span> are used synonymously, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-7.htm" title="You offer polluted bread on my altar; and you say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.">Malachi 1:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The altar.</span> This was the altar of incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>, etc.), which stood in the holy place in contradistinction to the altar of burnt offering, which was located in the outer court. The altar of burnt offering in Solomon's temple was of brass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), and in the tabernacle of shittim wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>); the altar of incense in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>) and in Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>) was constructed of wood overlaid with gold, but in this temple only of wood. Plumptre, commenting on this, writes, "Possibly Ezekiel shared the feelings of Daniel (Daniel 9:25), that the rebuilding would be 'in troublous times,' and did not contemplate an abundance of gold as likely to be the outcome of the scant offerings of an impoverished people." The dimensions of this altar in the tabernacle were two cubits high and one cubit long and broad; in the Solomonic temple, though not stated, they were probably the same as in the tabernacle; in Ezekiel's temple they were three cubits high, two cubits long (and probably two cubits broad). <span class="cmt_word">The corners of the altar</span> were most likely "the horns, or horn-shaped points projecting at the cornets." <span class="cmt_word">The length.</span> Ewald, Keil, Smend, and others, after the LXX., change into "base," "stand," or "pedestal," on the ground that the length has been already mentioned, and that one does not usually speak of a length being of wood; but it does not strike one as peculiarly objectionable to say that the altar had corner pieces, a length, and walls (or sides) of wood, meaning thereby to intimate that it was wholly constructed of timber. When the prophet's attention had been directed to it, the guide <span class="accented">who</span> accompanied him observed, <span class="cmt_word">This is the table that is before the Lord</span>, not because, as Bottcher conjectured, the altar was regarded as including the table of showbread, but because in the Law the offerings laid upon the altar had been spoken of as the bread of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6, 8, 17, 21, 22</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>); and because in this vision table and altar appear to be used inter-changeably (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-16.htm">Ezekiel 44:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-26 After the prophet had observed the courts, he was brought to the temple. If we attend to instructions in the plainer parts of religion, and profit by them, we shall be led further into an acquaintance with the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</body></html>
