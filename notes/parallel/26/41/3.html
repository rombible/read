in all other cases the angel had brought the prophet to the places to be measured, but as he is here entering the Holy of Holies, into which, under the law, Ezekiel might not enter, the angel goes in alone. The prophetic vision was not yet sufficiently clear to speak of the way into the true Holy of Holies as at length opened to all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The door, six cubits.--</span><span class= "ital">Door</span> is here used for <span class= "ital">doorway,</span> the clear space between the posts.

As this could not be entered even by a priest, but only by the high priest once a year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>), Ezekiel was left without, while "the man" announced to him in succession the measurements of the <span class="accented">adytum</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> these were taken. First, that of <span class="cmt_word">the post of the door</span> (the singular for the plural, meaning the post on either side of the doorway) <span class="cmt_word">two cubits</span>. Next, that of the door itself, which is given first as <span class="cmt_word">six</span> and second as <span class="cmt_word">seven cubits</span>. Kliefoth and Keil take the six as the height and the seven as the breadth of the entrance into the holy of holies; but as no other measurement of height occurs throughout this description, Dr. Currey regards "six" as the distance from "pest" to "post," and "seven" as the actual width of the door, each post projecting half a cubit beyond the hinge of the door, which opened inward. Ewald and Villalpandus, after the LXX., read, "the entrance six cubits and the flanks of the entrance seven cubits;" and these figures, 7 + 6 4- 7, certainly make up the breadth of the interior; only it is impossible to extract this meaning from the Hebrew without tampering with the text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-26 After the prophet had observed the courts, he was brought to the temple.
