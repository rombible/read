The only new point introduced is "the galleries thereof." It seems certain that this must refer to the building beyond "the separate place;" but the word for <span class= "ital">galleries</span> occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-16.htm" title="The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, paneled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;">Ezekiel 41:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm" title="Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.">Ezekiel 42:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm" title="Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.">Ezekiel 42:5</a>, and its derivation is quite unknown. The translation, <span class= "ital">galleries,</span> is probably correct; and as there was a space of 10 cubits on each side of the building in question, there may very well have been galleries covering and protecting its entrances, although they are not located with sufficient definiteness to be drawn on the plan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - With this verse begins a summary of measurements of which some have been already given, while others are new. Starting from the gizrah, or separate place, this summary mentions that the "man" measured <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the whole length of the erection; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the length of its "galleries" on the north and south sides; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the inner temple with the porches of the court. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The length of the separate place is not stated, that having been already done (ver. 13). The length of the galleries is specified as a hundred cubits, which shows they extended along the whole side of the building. As for the nature of these "galleries," or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, nothing can be ascertained from the derivation of the word. The LXX. renders it in this verse by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> ("things left over"), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a> and 5 by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>: the Vulgate has here <span class="accented">ethecas</span>, the Hebrew Latinized, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42.htm">Ezekiel 42</a>. <span class="accented">portions</span>. The <span class="accented">ethekim</span> were most likely passages or perches running along both (north and south) sides of the building, and supported either by pillars or ledges in the wall. The inner temple, which was measured, was the "house" which stood between the gizrah and the inner court; the porches of the court were the gate buildings in the inner and outer courts. Of all these the dimensions have already been reported, and are not again rehearsed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-26 After the prophet had observed the courts, he was brought to the temple. If we attend to instructions in the plainer parts of religion, and profit by them, we shall be led further into an acquaintance with the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</body></html>
