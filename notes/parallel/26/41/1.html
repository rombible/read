There is an apparent discrepancy between this and the following verse, where "the sides of the door" are said to be "five cubits," and the latter agrees with the whole width of the house (5 + 10 + 5 = 20.) It is necessary, therefore, to understand the measurement of this verse as taken the other way--as we should say, the side walls of the doors were of the same thickness with the other walls--viz., six cubits. The words <span class= "ital">which was</span> are not in the original, and tend to give a false impression. <span class= "ital">Tabernacle</span> or <span class= "ital">tent</span> is the name by which the sanctuary was known before the erection of the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The temple.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> frequently applied to the whole building (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14, 15</a>), is here used of the nave of the temple, the holy place, as distinguished from the holy of holies (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>). Schroder alone of commentators holds by the extended meaning.

The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">The breadth of the tabernacle</span>; or, <span class="accented">the tent</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>), has occasioned difficulty.

It is sufficient to understand the phrase as signifying that the measurements noted had a special relation to the entire breadth of the temple, here styled "tabernacle," or "tent," to indicate the covered portion of the edifice, which, in this respect, and in respect of its being the place of meeting between Jehovah and Israel, resembled the ancient sanctuary of the wilderness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-26 After the prophet had observed the courts, he was brought to the temple.
