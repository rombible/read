The words are, literally, <span class= "ital">I saw for the house a height </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an elevation) <span class= "ital">round about,</span> and the meaning of this is explained in what follows. The Temple, as has been already said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm" title="The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.">Ezekiel 40:49</a>), was entered by a flight of steps leading up to the porch, and was therefore on a higher level than the court. We are now told that the side chambers had a foundation of six cubits. Whether this "foundation" of the Temple and the side chambers was built of masonry, or, as is more probable, was a sort of basement to contain cisterns and storage rooms, we are not told; but it probably extended, under the name of "the place that was left" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-9.htm" title="The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.">Ezekiel 41:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-11.htm" title="And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.">Ezekiel 41:11</a>), five cubits beyond the outer wall of the chambers, forming a platform from which they were entered.<p><span class= "bld">Six great cubits.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">six cubits to the joint,</span> or <span class= "ital">to the armpit,</span> for the word has both significations. It is plain that a cubit of a different length, measured to the armpit, cannot be intended, both because no such cubit is known to have been in use at any time, and because Ezekiel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm" title="And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.">Ezekiel 40:5</a> has already fixed the length of the cubit he uses. The sense of <span class= "ital">joint</span> is therefore to be taken, and this applied architecturally can only mean the point at which one part of the building joins another; here, the point where the superstructure meets the foundation, or, as we should say, "six cubits to the water-table."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> explains that "the house" did not stand upon the level ground, but, like many temple buildings in antiquity (see Schurer, in Riehm's 'Handworterbuch,' art. "Tern. pel Salerno"), <span class="cmt_word">upon a height</span> - or, <span class="accented">raised basement</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">round about</span>, which agrees with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> that the temple was approached by means of a stair. In consequence of this, the foundations of the side chambers were <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">full reed of six great cubits</span>; or, <span class="accented">of six cubits to the joining</span> (Revised Version); "six cubits to the story" (Ewald); literally, <span class="accented">six cubits to the armpit</span>. This can hardly mean six cubits each equal to the distance from the elbow to the wrist, which would be a new definition of the length of the reed; but as Havernick and Kliefoth propose, must be taken as an architectural term indicative of the point where one portion of the building joined on to another. Accordingly, by most interpreters the six cubits are considered to be a statement of the height of the ceiling above the floor in each story, which would give an elevation of eighteen cubits for the three stories; but probably they mark only the height of the temple and side chamber basis above the ground. Kliefoth includes both views, and obtains an altitude of twenty-four cubits from the ground to the temple roof. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-26 After the prophet had observed the courts, he was brought to the temple. If we attend to instructions in the plainer parts of religion, and profit by them, we shall be led further into an acquaintance with the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</body></html>
