The prophet's mind had apparently been dwelling, after the close of his previous utterance, on the imagery of earlier writers, in which Israel had appeared as the vine of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), and to which he himself refers again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-10.htm">Ezekiel 19:10</a>. He saw how men might pervert that image to their own destruction. And he expands the parable, as our Lord does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15.htm">John 15</a>. Men might dwell, perhaps were actually dwelling, on the thought that they were branches of the true vine, and therefore could not perish. He exposes the groundlessness of that hope in tones of scornful sarcasm. If the vine did not bear fruit, or if it only brought forth wild grapes, then its special excellence was gone, and it challenged comparison with other trees only as a timber tree, and what was its worth as such? If Israel was not true to its vocation, it was poorer and weaker than the heathen nations round it. So far the general thought is clear. In dealing with details, we note that the words in italics, "or than," should disappear, and that the words should stand as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">What is the vine more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-8 Jerusalem like an unfruitful vine. - If a vine be fruitful, it is valuable. But if not fruitful, it is worthless and useless, it is cast into the fire. Thus man is capable of yielding a precious fruit, in living to God; this is the sole end of his existence; and if he fails in this, he is of no use but to be destroyed. What blindness then attaches to those who live in the total neglect of God and of true religion! This similitude is applied to Jerusalem. Let us beware of an unfruitful profession. Let us come to Christ, and seek to abide in him, and to have his words abide in us.</body></html>
