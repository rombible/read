It is not said who it was that spoke, but the "He" in connection with the vision before him could be none other than the Most High, whose glory that vision was given to reveal. The phrase "son of man" is common enough throughout the Scriptures, as meaning simply <span class= "ital">man, </span>but is never used in an address to a prophet, except to Ezekiel and Daniel. To Daniel it is used only once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a>), while to Ezekiel it is used above ninety times. The reason is, doubtless, that since he was the prophet of the captivity he was addressed in the common terms of the language where he lived. "Son of man" for "man" is so common in the Aramaic languages that it is even used of Adam himself in the Syriac version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1Corinthians 15:45-47</a>. The address to Ezekiel here as "man," just as under similar circumstances to Daniel when he had fallen upon his face through awe of the supernatural presence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a>), is doubtless in compassion to his weakness. And then comes the strengthening command, "Stand upon thy feet," that he may be able to receive the communication God is about to make to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Son of man,</span> etc. It is noticeable that the phrase (<span class="accented">ben adam</span>), as addressed to a prophet, occurs only in Ezekiel, in whom we find it not less than eighty times, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>. As used elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>, and in Ezekiel's use of it, it is probably connected with the history of Adam, as created from the ground (<span class="accented">adamah</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>. The prophet is reminded, in the very moment of his highest inspiration, of his Adam nature with all its infirmity and limitations. In the use of a like phrase (<span class="accented">bar enosh</span>, instead of <span class="accented">ben adam</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> we have the same truth implied. There one like unto man in all things is called to share the sovereignty of the "Ancient of Days," the Eternal One. Here the prophet, nothing in himself, is called to be the messenger of God to other sons of men. It is in many ways suggestive that our Lord should have chosen the same formula for constant use when speaking of himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, and <span class="accented">passim</span> in the Gospels). <span class="cmt_word">Stand upon thy feet.</span> The attitude of adoration is changed, by the Divine command, into that of expectant service, that of awe and dread for the courage of a soldier of the Lord of hosts (compare the parallels of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Lest Ezekiel should be lifted up with the abundance of the revelations, he is put in mind that still he is a son of man, a weak, mortal creature. As Christ usually called himself the Son of man, it was also an honourable distinction. Ezekiel's posture showed reverence, but his standing up would be a posture of greater readiness and fitness for business. God will speak to us, when we stand ready to do what he commands us. As Ezekiel had not strength of his own, the Spirit entered into him. God is graciously pleased to work in us whatever he requires of us. The Holy Spirit sets us upon our feet, by inclining our wills to our duty. Thus, when the Lord calls upon the sinner to awake, and attend to the concerns of his soul, the Spirit of life and grace comes with the call. Ezekiel is sent with a message to the children of Israel. Many might treat his message with contempt, yet they should know by the event that a prophet had been sent to them. God will be glorified, and his word made honourable, whether it be a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.</body></html>
