After the captivity of the ten tribes, the two forming the kingdom of Judah, with such remnants of the others as had been induced by Hezekiah and others to cast in their lot with them, are constantly spoken of as "Israel." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm" title="Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:">Ezra 2:2</a>.) The continuity of the whole nation was considered as preserved in the remnant, and hence this same mode of expression passed into the New Testament. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm" title="To which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.">Acts 26:7</a>.) It is only when there is especial occasion to distinguish between the two parts of the nation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/4-5.htm" title="For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shall you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 4:5-6</a>, that the name of Israel is used in contrast with that of Judah.<p><span class= "bld">A rebellious nation.</span>--Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">rebellious nations, </span>the word being the same as that commonly used distinctively for the heathen, so that the children of Israel are here spoken of as "rebellious heathen." There could be no epithet which would carry home more forcibly to the mind of an Israelite the state of antagonism in which he had placed himself against his God. (Comp. the "Lo-ammi" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a>, and also the discourse of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.">John 8:39</a>.) Yet still, the God from whom they had turned aside was even now sending to them His prophet, and seeking to win them back to His love and obedience, in true correspondence to the vision of the bow in the cloud about the majesty on high.<p>The following verses enlarge, with a variety of epithets and repetitions, upon the hard-heartedness and perverseness of the people. This had always been the character of the Israelites from the time of Moses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff necked people:">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-5.htm" title="For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff necked people: I will come up into the middle of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do to you.">Exodus 33:5</a>, &c), and continued to be to the end (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>); so entirely without ground is the allegation that they were chosen as a people peculiarly inclined to the right. It is to such a people that Ezekiel is to be sent, and he needed to be prepared and encouraged for his work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To a rebellious nation</span>; literally, with Revised Version, <span class="accented">nations that are rebellious.</span> The Hebrew word (<span class="accented">goim</span>) is that used elsewhere for "heathen" and that may be its sense here. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a>. Judah and Israel may be thought of as having fallen to the level of the heathen. Part of Ezekiel's work was actually addressed to the heathen as such (ch. 25-32.). The word may, however, be used in the plural to include both Judah and the remnant of the northern kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">They and their fathers.</span> The words anticipate the teaching of ch. 18. The people to whom the prophet was sent could not say that they were suffering for the sins of their fathers. They, in their own persons, had <span class="cmt_word">transgressed</span> up to the very day on which the prophet received his mission. They had <span class="cmt_word">rebelled</span> as their fathers had done in the days of Moses and Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-18.htm">Joshua 22:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Lest Ezekiel should be lifted up with the abundance of the revelations, he is put in mind that still he is a son of man, a weak, mortal creature. As Christ usually called himself the Son of man, it was also an honourable distinction. Ezekiel's posture showed reverence, but his standing up would be a posture of greater readiness and fitness for business. God will speak to us, when we stand ready to do what he commands us. As Ezekiel had not strength of his own, the Spirit entered into him. God is graciously pleased to work in us whatever he requires of us. The Holy Spirit sets us upon our feet, by inclining our wills to our duty. Thus, when the Lord calls upon the sinner to awake, and attend to the concerns of his soul, the Spirit of life and grace comes with the call. Ezekiel is sent with a message to the children of Israel. Many might treat his message with contempt, yet they should know by the event that a prophet had been sent to them. God will be glorified, and his word made honourable, whether it be a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.</body></html>
