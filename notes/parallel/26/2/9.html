It is not that a hand by itself containing the roll was sent to the prophet, but a hand, either of one of the cherubim,. or from the throne above, was stretched forth to him. In the corresponding vision in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/10-8.htm" title="And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands on the sea and on the earth.">Revelation 10:8-9</a>, it is handed to the seer by the angel.<p><span class= "bld">A roll of a book.</span>--Books were anciently written upon skins sewed together, or upon papyrus in long strips, which were rolled up, one hand unrolling and the other rolling up from the other end as the contents were read. These were ordinarily written on one side only, as it would have been inconvenient to read the other; but in this case it was written on both sides," within and without," to denote the fullness of the message.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An hand was sent</span> (<span class="accented">put forth</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">unto me,</span> etc. Apparently the hand was not that of the human form seated on the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>), nor of one of the four living creatures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>), but one appearing mysteriously by itself, as in the history of Belshazzar's feast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a>). The words connect themselves with the use of the hand stretched out of a cloud as the symbols of the Divine energy both in Jewish and Christian art. The writer has in his possession a Jewish brass tablet, probably of the sixteenth century, commemorating the legend of the miraculous supply of oil at the Feast of the Dedication, in which such a hand appears as pouring oil into the seven-branched candlestick, or lamp, of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, a roll of a book,</span> etc. The words remind us of the volume, or roll, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>; like those which are still used in Jewish synagogues. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-10 Those who will do any thing to purpose in the service of God, must not fear men. Wicked men are as briers and thorns; but they are nigh unto cursing, and their end is to be burned. The prophet must be faithful to the souls of those to whom he was sent. All who speak from God to others, must obey his voice. The discoveries of sin, and the warnings of wrath, should be matter of lamentation. And those acquainted with the word of God, will clearly perceive it is filled with woe to impenitent sinners; and that all the precious promises of the gospel are for the repenting, believing servants of the Lord.</body></html>
