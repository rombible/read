And he said to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make your belly bitter, but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey.">Revelation 10:9-10</a>. The figure of eating for receiving into the heart, so as to be thoroughly possessed by what is communicated, is not an uncommon one. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53-58</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not thou rebellious,</span> etc. The words convey a warning against the prophet's natural weakness. Instinctively he shrank, as Moses had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10-13</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>), from his dread vocation of being a "mortal vessel of the Divine Word." In so shrinking he would identify himself with the very "rebellion" which he was sent to reprove, and would incur its punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Eat that I give thee.</span> As in the parallel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>, the words imply that what was to be given him was no message resting, as it were, on the surface of the soul. It was to enter into the prophet's innermost life, to be the food and nourishment of his soul; to be, in our familiar phrase, "inwardly digested" and incorporated with his very flesh and blood. He was to live "not by bread only" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>), but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-10 Those who will do any thing to purpose in the service of God, must not fear men. Wicked men are as briers and thorns; but they are nigh unto cursing, and their end is to be burned. The prophet must be faithful to the souls of those to whom he was sent. All who speak from God to others, must obey his voice. The discoveries of sin, and the warnings of wrath, should be matter of lamentation. And those acquainted with the word of God, will clearly perceive it is filled with woe to impenitent sinners; and that all the precious promises of the gospel are for the repenting, believing servants of the Lord.</body></html>
