What he saw was "lamentations, and mourning, and woe;" in other words, this was the whole character of the message he was commissioned to bear until the great judgment in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple should be fulfilled, when, after Ezekiel 33, his prophecies assume a consolatory character.

This, like the tables of stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15</a>), was written, as a symbol of the fulness of its message, on both sides. And as he looked at the roll thus "spread before" him, he saw that it was no evangel, no glad tidings, that he had thus to identify with his work, but one from first to last of <span class="cmt_word">lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</span> Jeremiah had been known as the prophet of weeping, and was about this time (probably a little later) writing his own Lamentations (the Hebrew title of the book, however, is simply its first words) over the fall of Jerusalem. Ezekiel's work was to be of a like nature. The word meets us again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-1.htm">Ezekiel 19:1, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-2.htm">Ezekiel 27:2, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2, 16</a>) as the keynote of his writings. Out of such a book, though the glad tidings were to come afterwards, his own prophetic work was to be evolved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-10 Those who will do any thing to purpose in the service of God, must not fear men. Wicked men are as briers and thorns; but they are nigh unto cursing, and their end is to be burned. The prophet must be faithful to the souls of those to whom he was sent. All who speak from God to others, must obey his voice. The discoveries of sin, and the warnings of wrath, should be matter of lamentation. And those acquainted with the word of God, will clearly perceive it is filled with woe to impenitent sinners; and that all the precious promises of the gospel are for the repenting, believing servants of the Lord.</body></html>
