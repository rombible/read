The LXX. gives two verbs, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f72;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">increduli et subversores.</span> The words, however, are formed from roots that imply "pricking" or "burning," and the Authorized Version rendering, followed by the Revised Version, is tenable enough. A cognate form of the first is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>, and there the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;</span>, and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">spina.</span> A like figurative use of "scorpions" is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-11.htm">1 Kings 12:11</a> (but here the reference may be to some scorpion like scourge) and Ecclus. 26:7 (compare also our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a>). Be not afraid Compare the like command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>. The words imply, probably, a past as well as a future experience. Ezekiel had already known what it was to dwell among those whose hearts were venomous as scorpions. The comparison was a sufficiently familiar one among both Eastern and Greek writers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-10 Those who will do any thing to purpose in the service of God, must not fear men. Wicked men are as briers and thorns; but they are nigh unto cursing, and their end is to be burned. The prophet must be faithful to the souls of those to whom he was sent. All who speak from God to others, must obey his voice. The discoveries of sin, and the warnings of wrath, should be matter of lamentation. And those acquainted with the word of God, will clearly perceive it is filled with woe to impenitent sinners; and that all the precious promises of the gospel are for the repenting, believing servants of the Lord.</body></html>
