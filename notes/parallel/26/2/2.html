(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm" title="Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.">Daniel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/10-15.htm" title="And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.">Daniel 10:15-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:">Revelation 1:17</a>.) There can be no doubt, therefore, that <span class= "ital">the spirit </span>is here the Spirit of God, and not merely the prophet's own human vigour and courage; and this is made still more plain in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-24.htm" title="Then the spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself within your house.">Ezekiel 3:24</a>. It was this which "set him upon his feet," and enabled him amid such surroundings of awe to receive the word spoken to him; for while the revelation by vision still remained before him (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/3-12.htm" title="Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.">Ezekiel 3:12-13</a>), he was now to be instructed also by the clearer revelation of the direct voice from heaven. We are not to think of any physical force exerted upon the prophet, but of all these things as still taking place in vision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Spirit,</span> etc. It scarcely admits of question (though the Hebrew has no article, and so far Luther's Version, "Ich ward wieder erquickt," is tenable) that the word is used in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20, 21</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a>). The Spirit which moved the "living creatures" and the "wheels" in the mysterious symbol was now in him. Ezekiel finds in that fact the ground of his prophetic inspiration (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, etc.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Lest Ezekiel should be lifted up with the abundance of the revelations, he is put in mind that still he is a son of man, a weak, mortal creature. As Christ usually called himself the Son of man, it was also an honourable distinction. Ezekiel's posture showed reverence, but his standing up would be a posture of greater readiness and fitness for business. God will speak to us, when we stand ready to do what he commands us. As Ezekiel had not strength of his own, the Spirit entered into him. God is graciously pleased to work in us whatever he requires of us. The Holy Spirit sets us upon our feet, by inclining our wills to our duty. Thus, when the Lord calls upon the sinner to awake, and attend to the concerns of his soul, the Spirit of life and grace comes with the call. Ezekiel is sent with a message to the children of Israel. Many might treat his message with contempt, yet they should know by the event that a prophet had been sent to them. God will be glorified, and his word made honourable, whether it be a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.</body></html>
