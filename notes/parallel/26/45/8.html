Former kings of Israel had no domain given them, and this had tempted them to acquire private property by violence and extortion. The people had been forewarned of this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-14.htm" title="And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.">1Samuel 8:14</a>), had often experienced it in their history, and had heard the rebukes of their prophets on account of it (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13-19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My princes shall no more oppress my people</span>. That Israel in former times had suffered from the oppressions and exactions of her kings, from Solomon downwards, as Samuel had predicted she would (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>), was matter of history (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4, 10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a>), and was perhaps partly explained, though not justified, by the fact that the kings had no crown lands assigned them for their support. This excuse, however, for regal tyranny should in future cease, as a sufficient portion of land should be allocated to the prince and his successors, who accordingly should <span class="cmt_word">give</span>, or <span class="accented">leave</span>, the rest of the <span class="cmt_word">land to the house of Israel according to their tribes</span>. The use of "princes" does not show, as Hengstenberg asserts, that "under the ideal unity of the prince in Ezekiel, a numerical plurality is included," and that "these who understand by the prince merely the Messiah must here do violence to the text;" but simply, as Kliefoth explains, that Ezekiel was thinking of Israel's past kings, and contrasting with them the rulers Israel might have in the future, without affirming that these should be many or one (see on Ezekiel 44:3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</body></html>
