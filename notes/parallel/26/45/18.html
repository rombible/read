In each case the deviations from the Mosaic law are remarkable, as well as the omission of any mention of the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) and of the Great Day of Atonement. Ezekiel, as a priest, must have been familiar with the law in these matters, and therefore the changes he introduces must have been intentional. Like the changes in the division of the land, they seemed designed to show that this was an ideal vision. No attempt was ever made to follow the arrangements here laid down. The Mosaic law prescribed (in addition to the burnt offerings and meat offerings) a sin offering, which was to be a he-goat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-15.htm" title="And one kid of the goats for a sin offering to the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.">Numbers 28:15</a>) for the first of every month; also on the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Great Day of Atonement, two he-goats (one for the "scape-goat") were to be offered. Of all these Ezekiel mentions only the sin offering for the beginning of the first month, and also for the seventh day of the same, of which the Mosaic law knows nothing; but he provides for these bullocks instead of goats. In the ritual of the blood he makes a corresponding change. The law gives no special directions for the sprinkling of the blood of the sin offerings on the first of each month, because they were included in the ordinary rule (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-25.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.">Leviticus 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-30.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.">Leviticus 4:30</a>, &c.) of sprinkling upon the sides of the altar of burnt offering; only in the case of the sin offering for the high priest or for the whole congregation (when the victim was a bullock) was the blood brought within the Temple itself, and sprinkled seven times before the vail, and applied to the horns of the altar of incense. On the Day of Atonement it was carried into the Holy of Holies, and sprinkled upon and before the mercyseat. All this is here changed. Some of the blood of these sin offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-19.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it on the posts of the house, and on the four corners of the settle of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.">Ezekiel 45:19</a>) is to be put upon the "posts of the house" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-21.htm" title="The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.">Ezekiel 41:21</a>), upon the "corners of the settle of the altar," and "upon the posts of the gate of the inner court."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-25.</span> - These verses allude to the institution of a new feast-cycle, whose deviations from that of the Pentateuch will be best exhibited in the course of exposition. Whether three festivals are referred to or only two is debated by expositors. Fairbairn, Havernick, Ewald, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre decide for three - the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20), the Passover (vers. 21-24), and the Feast of Tabernacles (ver. 25). Kliefoth, Smend, and Curtsy find only two a Passover and a Feast of Tabernacles. Hengstenberg sees in the solemnities of the first and seventh days of the new year a special consecration service for the new temple, not to be repeated, corresponding to the dedication of the tabernacle on the first day of the first month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-1.htm">Exodus 40:1, 17</a>), or of the Solomonic temple in the seventh month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>), and in imitation of which the post-exilic temple was dedicated, probably on the first day of the year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-22</a>). Against the notion of a special dedication service, however, stand the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the temple had been already consecrated by the entrance into it of the glory of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the service here described differs in respect either of time or ritual or both from every one of the three cited dedications. Between the two other views the difference is slight. If the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20) was distinct from the Passover, it was still, by the ritual of the seventh and fourteenth days of the first month (vers. 20, 22), so closely connected with the Passover as practically to form a preparation for and introduction to it. Then the circumstance that the proper ceremonial for the new moon is afterwards described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a>) favors the proposal to regard the rites in vers. 18-20 as a part of the Passover festival; while this view, if adopted, will explain the omission from ver. 25 of all mention of the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1</a>), and of the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>), with which the autumn festival was usually preceded, by showing that in lieu of these a sacrificial observance had been prefixed to the Passover on the first and seventh days of the first month. Smend's theory, that "Ezekiel's feast-calendar divides the ecclesiastical year into two halves, each of which begins with a re. conciliation ceremony (or expiatory sacrifice) on the first days of the first and seventh months respectively," would lend confirmation to the above view, were it not that the theory in question is based on an alteration of the text in ver. 20 (see Exposition). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God.</span> The usual solemn introduction prefixed to Divine enactments (comp. ver. 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-19.htm">Ezekiel 43:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-6.htm">Ezekiel 44:6, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the first month, in the first day of the month</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-13.htm">Genesis 8:13</a>). That the first month, Abib, was intended is apparent from ver. 21, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1</a>. Under the Mosaic Torah, the Passover began on the tenth day of the first month by the selection of a lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>), corresponding to which the great Day of Atonement in the seventh month fell upon the tenth day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>). In the Torah of Ezekiel, the ceremonies introducing and leading up to the Passover should begin with the first day of the month, as under the Law the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh mouth practically began the solemnities which culminated in the Feast of Tabernacles. <span class="cmt_word">A young bullock without blemish</span> should form the sacrificial offering on this first day of the year, according to the ordinance published by Ezekiel; that promulgated by the Hebrew lawgiver appointed for new moons generally, in addition to the burnt and meat offerings, a he-goat for a sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15</a>), and particularly for the first day of the seventh month, in addition to the regular burnt and meat offerings, one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs for a burnt offering, meat offerings of flour and oil for each of these animals, and a he-goat for a sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-6</a>). The object for which the Mosaic offerings were presented was to make atonement for the worshippers; the Ezekelian sacrifices should stand in more immediate relation to the place of worship, and be designed to <span class="cmt_word">cleanse the sanctuary</span> from such defilement, to be afterwards mentioned, as might be contracted from the presence in it of erring men (ver. 20). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</body></html>
