These oblations should be made for the maintenance of the necessary sacrificial worship in the new temple, for the meal, burnt, and peace or thank offerings that should there be presented to make reconciliation or atonement for the house of Israel. Compared with the offerings prescribed by the Law of Moses, these discover important variations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Of flour, the Law demanded one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour with a lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>), with a ram two-tenths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-6.htm">Numbers 15:6</a>), with a bullock three-tenths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-9.htm">Numbers 15:9</a>); of wheat and of barley Ezekiel's <span class="accented">Torah re</span>quires one-sixteenth of an ephah for each, i.e. one-third in all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Of oil, the Mosaic ordinance was, with a lamb should be presented one-fourth of a bin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one-twenty-fourth of a bath; with a ram, one-third of a bin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one-eighteenth of a bath; with a bullock one-half of a hin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one-twelfth of a bath. Ezekiel's ordinance was in every case one-tenth of a bath. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Of animals, the Pentateuchal legislation left the necessary victims, whether rams, goats, or bullocks, to be provided by the offerers at their own free-will, stipulating as compulsory only the firstborn of the flocks and herds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-26.htm">Leviticus 27:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-17.htm">Numbers 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-19.htm">Deuteronomy 15:19</a>), the first ripe fruits of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>), and the tithes, or tenths, of seed, fruit, the herd and flock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a>); the Ezekelian omits the latter, but ordains in lieu of the former that one animal out of every two hundred in every flock shall be obligatory on Jehovah's worshippers. Thus the demands of Ezekiel's Torah surpass those of the earlier or Mosaic Torah in quantity as well as quality. That these demands are definitely specified does not prove they should partake rather of the nature of a tax than of a free-will offering. That they were not to be regarded as taxes is shown by the absence of any allusion to penalties for neglect of payment; that they were designed to be looked upon as free-will offerings is plain from the circumstance that Jehovah never supposes for a moment that these generous offerings will be withheld; and perhaps all that is really signified by them is that the liberality of Jehovah's people in the future age should greatly exceed that which had been practiced at any former time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</body></html>
