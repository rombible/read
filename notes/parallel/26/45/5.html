The last clause of the verse, as it stands, admits of no satisfactory explanation. The suggestion that it may refer to twenty out of the thirty chambers in the outer court of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm" title="Then brought he me into the outward court, and, see, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were on the pavement.">Ezekiel 40:17</a>) is quite out of place. Even if these were intended for the use of the Levites (which does not appear), it would be strange that they should be abruptly spoken of in the midst of this description of the oblation. A slight change in the text--the transposition of two letters in the first word, and the change of one letter in the second for another much like it--will make the clause read, "for a possession of gates to dwell in," <span class= "ital">gates</span> being used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm" title="But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-27.htm" title="And the Levite that is within your gates; you shall not forsake him; for he has no part nor inheritance with you.">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:11</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm" title="But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm" title="But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your ox, nor your ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates; that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>), for cities. The sense would then be that this portion should be to the Levites what the former portion was to the priests, a place for their dwellings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - A portion of similar dimensions should likewise be marked off for the Levites, <span class="cmt_word">for themselves, for a possession of twenty chambers</span>; better, for a possession <span class="accented">unto themselves</span> for twenty <span class="accented">chambers</span> (Revised Version).

Kliefoth and Curroy retain the word "chambers "as in the text, and think the "chambers" and the "land" were two distinct possessions of the Levites, the chambers having been within (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17, 18</a>) as the land was without the sanctuary. Rosenm&uuml;ller, Havernick, Hengstenberg, and Schroder decide for "chambers," or "courts," rows of dwellings standing outside the sanctuary as the priests' chambers were located within. Havernick supposes that along with these, which were obviously designed to be employed when the Levites were on duty, there may have been other Levitical towns and dwellings, Hengstenberg conceives them as having been "barracks for the Levites, the inhabitants of which used the twentieth part of the land assigned to them as pasturage." Unfavorable to the first view is the fact that it requires the text to be altered. Against the second is its awkward dividing of the verse and unexpected interjection of a reference to cells within the sanctuary while speaking of the land without. The third, while not free from difficulty as taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> to be equivalent to "cell-buildings," is perhaps the best. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</body></html>
