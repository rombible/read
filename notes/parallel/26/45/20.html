Yet it is added, "so shall ye reconcile the house," more literally, make an atonement for the house; and the question has therefore been raised whether this offering on the seventh day was still for the purification of the sanctuary or for the sins of the people. The answer to this question must be sought in the sacrifices of the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), which these days seem intended to replace. These were very distinctly for the sins of the priests and the people, and at the same time for the tabernacle. The one involved the other, and the holy place required purification because of the sins of "the holy people" among whom it was placed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The same ceremony should be repeated on the <span class="cmt_word">seventh day of the month</span>, not on <span class="accented">the first day of the seventh month</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> Smend proposes, in accordance with the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x1fc3;</span>, and on the ground that "the seventh day of (the same) mouth" would have been in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-20.htm">Ezekiel 30:20</a>; at the same time admitting that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> is sometimes used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>), though not (except in this verse) by Ezekiel.
