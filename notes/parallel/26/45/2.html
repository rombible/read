The free space of <span class="cmt_word">fifty cubits round about for the suburbs</span> (or, <span class="accented">open places</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thereof</span> seems to indicate that the larger area was that alluded to by the prophet. That the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. occurs more frequently in the so-called priest-code (Leviticus 25:84; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2, 3, 4, 5, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2, 3, 8, 11, 13</a>, etc.) and in the Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-35.htm">1 Chronicles 6:35, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-14.htm">2 Chronicles 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-19.htm">2 Chronicles 31:19</a>) than in Ezekiel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-28.htm">Ezekiel 27:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15, 17</a>) is a fact; but on this fact cannot be founded an argument for the priority of Ezekiel, since it rather points to Ezekiel's acquaintance with such "suburbs" in connection with priestly and Levitical cities. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</body></html>
