unleavened bread shall be eaten.">Ezekiel 45:21</a> the Passover is appointed quite in accordance with the Mosaic institution, although there is a peculiarity in the language of the original which has led some writers to infer, unnecessarily, that the feast was to be kept for seven weeks. But the sacrifices are in many respects quite different. Nothing is said of the Paschal lamb itself: but this may be because it was understood as a matter of course. The sin offering by the Mosaic law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-17.htm" title="And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.">Numbers 28:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-22.htm" title="And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.">Numbers 28:22</a>) was to be a he-goat for each day; here, a bullock for the first day, and a he-goat for the other days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-23.htm" title="And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.">Ezekiel 45:23</a>). The burnt offering by the law was to be two bullocks, a ram, and seven yearling lambs for each day; here, seven bullocks and seven rams. The meat offering was to be three-tenths of an ephah of meal, mixed with oil, for each bullock, two-tenths for each ram, and one-tenth for each lamb, or one and a half ephahs in all daily; here, a whole ephah for each victim, making in all fourteen ephahs daily and as many hins of oil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-24.htm" title="And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.">Ezekiel 45:24</a>). The offerings required here therefore are much richer than under the law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The first day of the feast proper, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fourteenth, should be distinguished by the prince's presenting, <span class="cmt_word">for himself and for all the people of the land, a bullock for a sin offering.</span> That this was a deviation from the earlier Mosaic legislation in three particulars is apparent. In, the first place, the "sin offering" here prescribed was manifestly to take precedence of the Paschal feast proper, whereas in the Paschal festival of the so-called priest-code the daffy sacrifices were appointed to begin on the fifteenth after the Paschal lamb had been slain and eaten (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-8.htm">Leviticus 23:8</a>). In the second place, the sin offering was to consist of a bullock instead of a he-goat as formerly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-22.htm">Numbers 28:22</a>). In the third place, it was not intended to be renewed on each of the seven following days of the feast, but was designed, by repeating the sacrifice of the first and seventh days, to connect these with the fourteenth, on which the feast proper opened. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</body></html>
