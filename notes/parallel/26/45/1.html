They first describe the setting apart of a large part of the whole land for the sanctuary, the priests, the prince, and the city, in a way and in a geographical position entirely unknown either in the past or the subsequent history of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/45-1.htm" title="Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.">Ezekiel 45:1-8</a>). The portion assigned to the prince is to prevent violence and exaction on his part; in this connection all unjust measurements are to cease, and standard weights and measures are prescribed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/45-9.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 45:9-12</a>). Then follow directions for the tax or "oblation" to be paid by the people to the prince, that he may be able to furnish the required sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/45-13.htm" title="This is the oblation that you shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:">Ezekiel 45:13-17</a>). The chapter closes with directions concerning the daily sacrifices and the feasts, these feasts being in part unknown to the law; while some feasts that were prominent in the law are entirely omitted, and the ritual of nearly all is greatly changed. The whole is so different from the arrangements of the Mosaic economy, and so foreign to the restoration of that economy on the return from the exile, that it can only be explained of an ideal picture which both prophet and people understood was not to receive a literal realisation.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">When ye shall divide by lot.--</span>The same expression is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be to you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.">Ezekiel 47:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-29.htm" title="This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 48:29</a>, as it had long before been used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-6.htm" title="All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide you it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.">Joshua 13:6</a>; but that it does not imply anything of chance is plain from the fact that in Ezekiel 48 a definite portion of the land is assigned to each of the tribes by name. The idea seems to be the same as is conveyed by our word <span class= "ital">allotment.</span><p><span class= "bld">An oblation.</span>--Literally <span class= "ital">a heave offering.</span> This portion of the land is thus called from its analogy to the sacrificial gifts which were lifted up or <span class= "ital">heaved</span> before the Lord. As a small portion of these was burned upon the altar and the rest given to the priests, so here, a small part of this territory was to be occupied by the sanctuary and the rest given to the priests and Levites. A fuller description of this oblation is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>; it is here merely mentioned in connection with the support of the priests and the prince.<p><span class= "bld">Five and twenty thousand.--</span>In the original there is no mention of the measure to be used, but the English has rightly supplied <span class= "ital">reeds.</span> This is plain both from the size of the precincts of the Temple, which are made 500 reeds square in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/42-16.htm" title="He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.">Ezekiel 42:16-20</a>, and from the special mention of cubits in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm" title="Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.">Ezekiel 45:2</a> implying that the measure in other cases was different. The length is from east to west, as shown by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8</a>. This length of 25,000 reeds or 150,000 cubits is something over forty-seven statute miles. For its location and comparative size see the map under Ezekiel 48.<p><span class= "bld">The breadth shall be ten thousand.--</span>The Greek here reads <span class= "ital">twenty</span> thousand, and many would alter the text accordingly, but without any advantage. We know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-20.htm" title="All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: you shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city.">Ezekiel 48:20</a>, that the whole width of the oblation was 25,000, the same as its length; and this was made up of three portions: the northernmost, 10,000 wide (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm" title="And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.">Ezekiel 48:13</a>), for the Levites; the next, of the same width (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-10.htm" title="And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 48:10</a>), for the priests, in the midst of which was the sanctuary; and the remainder, half as wide (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm" title="And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 48:15</a>), for "a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs." Yet while this whole territory is there called the <span class= "ital">oblation,</span> the particular portion for the priests is also called by the same name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-9.htm" title="The oblation that you shall offer to the LORD shall be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.">Ezekiel 48:9</a>). The word may therefore be used here in the same sense as there, for that part of the oblation which was for the priests: the oblation of the oblation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - The portions of land that should be allotted to the sanctuary, the city, and the prince. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover, When ye shall divide by lot the land</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and in your causing the land to fall</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for inheritance</span>. As the territory of Canaan had been originally divided by lot among the twelve tribes after the conquest (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>, etc.), this same method of allocating the soil amongst the new community should be followed on a second time taking possession of it after the exile. Currey believes the phrase, "divide by lot," "does not imply anything like casting lots, but is equivalent to our notion of <span class="accented">allotment</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> several portions being assigned by rule." There is, however, little doubt "lots" were cast to determine, if not the actual size, at least the precise situation, of each tribe's territory (see REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschNumbers 26:54 <span class="commentary">Keil</span> and 'Pulpit Commentary' on Numbers 26:54). That no such methodical distribution of Canaan ever took place, or for that matter could hays taken place amongst the returned exiles, should be proof sufficient that the prophet here moves in the region of the ideal and symbolical rather than of the real and literal. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall offer an oblation</span> -literally, <span class="accented">lift up a heave offering</span> (comp. Ezekiel 44:80; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-28.htm">Exodus 29:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-12.htm">Leviticus 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord, an holy portion of the land;</span> literally, a <span class="accented">holy</span> (portion) <span class="accented">from the land</span>. Very significantly, in the new partition of Palestine the Lord's portion should be the first to be marked off and solemnly dedicated to Jehovah for the purposes to be forthwith specified. Those who, like Wellhansen and Smend, perceive in this allotment of land to Jehovah, and therefore to the priests, a contradiction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a>, omit to notice first that Jehovah required some place on which his sanctuary might be erected, and the priests some ground on which to build houses for themselves; and secondly, that, so far as the priests were concerned, the laud was given by the people, not to them, but to Jehovah, and by him to them (comp. on Ezekiel 44:28). The exact site of this <span class="accented">terumah</span>, or "holy portion," is afterwards indicated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>); meanwhile its dimensions are recorded. <span class="cmt_word">The length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand</span>. Whether "reeds" or "cubits" should be supplied after "thousand" has divided expositors. Bottcher, Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Smend decide for "cubits," principally on the grounds that "cubits" are mentioned in ver. 2; that "cubits" have been the usual measure hitherto, even (as they contend) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>; and that otherwise the dimensions of this sacred territory must have been colossal, in fact, out of all proportion to the Holy Land, viz. about 720 square miles (25,000 reeds, or 42.5 miles, &times; 10,000 reeds, or 17 miles, = 722.5 square miles). Havernick, Keil, <span class="accented">Kliefoth</span>, Currey, and Plumptre favor "reeds," chiefly for the reasons that in ver. 2 "cubits" are specified, and are therefore to be regarded as exceptional; that the customary measuring instrument throughout has been a reed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>); and that the dimensions, which Ezekiel designed should be colossal (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), correspond exactly with the measurements afterwards given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>, if these he in reeds, but not if they be in cubits. As to the breadth of this <span class="accented">terumah</span> from east to west, Hitzig, Keil, <span class="accented">Smend</span>, Schroder, and Plumptre follow the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) in substituting 20,000 for 10,000, considering that the space referred to in ver. 3 appears as if meant to be taken from an already measured larger area, which could only be that of ver. 1 - the portion in ver. 1 being the whole territory assigned to the priests and Levites, and that in ver. 3 the allotment for the priests. Kliefoth, however, contends that no necessity exists for tampering with the text, and certainly if vers. 1-4 be regarded as descriptive of the priests' portion <span class="accented">only</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> in the phrase, "of this measure" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>), in ver. 8 be rendered "according to" - a sense it may have (see Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub voce</span>), the supposed difficulty disappears. In this case the demonstrative this in the last clause will refer to the priests' portion exclusively; in the former ease, to the whole portion of the priests and Levites. That <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a> declares the Levites' portion to be "holy unto the land" does not prove it must have been included in the holy <span class="accented">terumah</span> of ver. 1 Nor does this concession follow, as will appear, from ver. 7. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</body></html>
