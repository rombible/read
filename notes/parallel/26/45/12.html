but the latter part of the verse is extremely obscure. The <span class= "ital">maneh</span> is mentioned elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm" title="And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.">1Kings 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-69.htm" title="They gave after their ability to the treasure of the work three score and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.">Ezra 2:69</a>; Neh. vii 71, and is translated in our version <span class= "ital">pound.</span> Its actual value is unknown. If the text as it stands is correct, it is possible that in Ezekiel's time three different <span class= "ital">manehs</span> were in use, of the values respectively assigned to them; but of this there is no other evidence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The shekel shall be twenty garahs</span>. This ordained that the standard for money weights should remain as it had been fixed by the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-25.htm">Leviticus 27:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>). The "shekel" (or "weight," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, "to weigh;" compare the Italian <span class="accented">lira</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> French <span class="accented">livre</span> out of the Latin <span class="accented">libra</span>, and the English Found sterling) was a piece of silver whose value, originally determined by weight, became gradually fixed at the definite sum of twenty "gerahs," beans, or grains (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, "to roll"). The "gerah," value two pence, was the smallest silver coin; the "shekel," therefore, was forty pence, or 3s. 4d. Commentators are divided as to how the second half of this verse should be understood: <span class="cmt_word">twenty shekel, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.</span> The "maneh" (or "portion," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to be divided"), which occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-71.htm">Nehemiah 7:71, 72</a> - "that is to say, only in books written during the Captivity or subsequent to it" (Keil) - was probably the same coin as the Greek rains (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span>), though its weight may have somewhat differed. A comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a> shows that a maneh was equal to a hundred shekels, which cannot be made to harmonize with the statement in this verse without supposing either that an error has crept in through transcription, or that the chronicler has employed the late Greek style of reckoning, in which one mina is equivalent to a hundred drachmas. Again, the Hebrew and Attic talents, when ex-stained, fail to solve the problem as to how the text should be rendered. The Hebrew talent, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, contained 3000 sacred or Mosaic shekels according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>; and the Attic talon 60 minas, each of 100 drachmas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 6000 drachmas, or 3000 drachmas, each of which again was equal to a Hebrew shekel. Hence the Attic mina must have been one-sixtieth part of 3000, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 50 shekels, which once more fails to correspond with Ezekiel's notation. What this notation is depends on how the clauses should be connected. If with "and," <span class="accented">as</span> Ewald, following the Targumists, thinks, Ezekiel is supposed to have ordained that in the future the maneh should be, not 50, but 60 (20 + 25 -1- 15) shekels - the weight of the 'Babylonian <span class="accented">mana</span> ('Records of the Past,' 4:97, second series); only, if he so intended, one sees not why he should have adopted this roundabout method of expression instead of simply stating that henceforth the maneh should be sixty shekels If with "or," as Michaelis, Gesenius, Hitzig, and Hengstenberg prefer, then the prophet is regarded as asserting that in the future three manehs of varying values should be current - one of gold, another of silver, and a third of copper (Hitzig), or all of the same metal, but of different magnitudes (Michaelis); and this arrangement might well have been appointed for the future, although no historical trace can be found of any such manehs of twenty, twenty-five, and fifteen shekels respectively having been in circulation either <span class="accented">among</span> the Hebrews or among foreign peoples. Kliefoth pronounces both solutions unsatisfactory, but has nothing better to offer. Keil supposes a corruption of the text of old standing, for the correction of which we are as yet without materials. Bertheau and Havernick follow the LXX. (Cod. Alex.), <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">The five shekel</span> (piece) shall be five shekels, <span class="accented">and the ten shekel</span> (piece) shall be tea shekels, <span class="accented">end fifty shekels shall your maneh be</span>;" but Hitzig's judgment on this proposal, with which Kliefoth and Keil agree, will most likely be deemed correct, that "it carries on the face of it the probability of its resting upon nothing more than an attempt to bring the text into harmony with the ordinary value of the maneh." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</body></html>
