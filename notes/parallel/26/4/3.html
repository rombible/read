This was to be set for a wall of iron between the prophet (representing the besiegers) and the city, doubtless as symbolical of the strength of the besiegers' lines, and of the impossibility there would be of an escape from the city by a sally. Their foes should be made too strong for them defensively as well as offensively.<p><span class= "bld">A sign to the house of Israel.</span>--As already said, the tribe of Judah, with the associated remnants of the other tribes, is considered as representing the whole nation after the Assyrian captivity, and is spoken of as "the house of Israel" except when there is occasion to distinguish especially between the two parts of the nation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm" title="But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.">Ezekiel 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm" title="Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-4.htm" title="Then take of them again, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-6.htm" title="He said furthermore to me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations.">Ezekiel 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm" title="And he had brothers the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.">2Chronicles 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-27.htm" title="And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.">2Chronicles 28:27</a>, &c.) The prophecy would have been equally effective whether seen as a symbolic act or only related.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An iron pan.</span> The word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-5.htm">Leviticus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-21.htm">Leviticus 6:21</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>, for a flat or shallow vessel in which cakes were baked or fried. Such a pan, like the Scotch "girdle," or our "gridiron," may well have formed part of the furniture of the prophet's house when it was taken for this strange use. It was to represent the kind of shield or fence set up on the ground, from behind which the besiegers discharged their arrows. Such shields are seen, like the battering rams, in Assyrian bas-reliefs (Layard, 'Nineveh,' etc., 2:345). Other interpretations, which see in it the symbol of the circumvallation of the city, or of the impenetrable barrier which the sins of the people had set up between themselves and Jehovah, or of the prophet himself as strong and unyielding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>), do not commend themselves. The flat plate did not go round the city, and the spiritual meaning is out of harmony with the context. <span class="cmt_word">This shall be a sign,</span> etc. (comp. like forms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-6.htm">Ezekiel 12:6, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25, 27</a>). The exiles of Tel-Abib, who wore the only spectators of the prophet's acts, are taken as representatives of "the house of Israel," that phrase being commonly used by Ezekiel, unless, as in vers. 5, 6, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>, there is a special reason for noting a distinction for Jonah as representing the whole nation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 The prophet was to represent the siege of Jerusalem by signs. He was to lie on his left side for a number of days, supposed to be equal to the years from the establishment of idolatry. All that the prophet sets before the children of his people, about the destruction of Jerusalem, is to show that sin is the provoking cause of the ruin of that once flourishing city.</body></html>
