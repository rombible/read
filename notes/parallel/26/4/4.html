(See, among many other passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-19.htm" title="Yet say you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.">Ezekiel 18:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-35.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your prostitutions.">Ezekiel 23:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-8.htm" title="Therefore every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.">Leviticus 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-34.htm" title="After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.">Numbers 14:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>.) It is clear, therefore, that Ezekiel is here to represent the people as enduring the Divine judgment upon their sins. This may seem inconsistent with his representing at the same time the besiegers of Jerusalem, the instruments in the Divine hand for inflicting that punishment; but such inconsistencies are common enough in all symbolic representations, and neither offend nor in any way mar the effect of the representation. "The house of Israel" is here expressly distinguished from "the house of Judah," and means the ten tribes. They are symbolised by the prophet's lying on his <span class= "ital">left </span>side, because it was the Oriental habit to look to the east when describing the points of the compass, and the northern kingdom was therefore on the left.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lie thou also upon thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">left</span> <span class="cmt_word">side,</span> etc. We find the explanation of the attitude in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>. Samaria was on the "left hand," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the north, as a man looked to the east. So the same word <span class="accented">yamin</span> is both "the south" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-12.htm">Psalm 84:12</a>) and "the right hand." Here, accordingly, the "house of Israel" is taken in its specific sense, as the northern kingdom as distinguished from the "house of Judah" in ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt bear their iniquity;</span> <span class="accented">ie.</span>, as in all similar passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-18.htm">Leviticus 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>, <span class="accented">et al</span>.), the punishment of their iniquity. The words so taken will help us to understand the numerical symbolism of the words that followed. The prophet was by this act to identify himself with both divisions of the nation, by representing in this strange form at once the severity and the limits of their punishment. I adopt, without any hesitation, the view that we have here the record of a fact, and not of a vision narrated. The object of the act was to startle men and make them wonder. As week after week went on this, <span class="accented">exceptis excipiendis</span>, was to be Ezekiel's permanent attitude, as of one crushed to the very ground, prostrate under the burden thus laid upon him, as impersonating his people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 The prophet was to represent the siege of Jerusalem by signs. He was to lie on his left side for a number of days, supposed to be equal to the years from the establishment of idolatry. All that the prophet sets before the children of his people, about the destruction of Jerusalem, is to show that sin is the provoking cause of the ruin of that once flourishing city.</body></html>
