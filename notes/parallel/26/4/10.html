The best computations fix it at about 220 grains, and this would make the allowance of twenty shekels equal to something less than eleven ounces, scarcely enough to sustain life. "Meat" is here used, as often in Scripture, of any kind of food. The extreme scarcity of food is also denoted by its being weighed rather than measured. "From time to time" means at set intervals of time (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-25.htm" title="And their brothers, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.">1Chronicles 9:25</a>), here doubtless once a day. Only the longer period of 390 days is here mentioned, but the same command doubtless applied to both periods.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy meat</span>, etc.; better, <span class="accented">food</span>, here and elsewhere. Coarse as the food was, the people would have but scanty rations of it. Men were not, as usual, to measure the corn, but to weigh the bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>). Taking the shekel at about 220 grains, the twenty shekels would be about 10 or 12 ounces. The common allowance in England for prison or pauper dietaries gives, I believe from 24 to 32 ounces, Besides other food. And this was to be taken, not as hunger prompted, but at the appointed hour. once a day. The whole scene of the people of the besieged city coming for their daily rations is brought vividly before us. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-17 The bread which was Ezekiel's support, was to be made of coarse grain and pulse mixed together, seldom used except in times of urgent scarcity, and of this he was only to take a small quantity. Thus was figured the extremity to which the Jews were to be reduced during the siege and captivity. Ezekiel does not plead, Lord, from my youth I have been brought up delicately, and never used to any thing like this; but that he had been brought up conscientiously, and never had eaten any thing forbidden by the law. It will be comfortable when we are brought to suffer hardships, if our hearts can witness that we have always been careful to keep even from the appearance of evil. See what woful work sin makes, and acknowledge the righteousness of God herein. Their plenty having been abused to luxury and excess, they were justly punished by famine. When men serve not God with cheerfulness in the abundance of all things, God will make them serve their enemies in the want of all things.</body></html>
