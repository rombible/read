If the mixing of these in one vessel and making bread of them all together was not against the exact letter of the law, it was, at least, a plain violation of its spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm" title="You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle engender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come on you.">Leviticus 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm" title="You shall not sow your vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown, and the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled.">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>), thus again indicating the stern necessity which should be laid upon the people.<p><span class= "bld">Three hundred and ninety days.</span>--No mention is here made of the additional forty days.

The symbolism seems to have a twofold meaning. We can scarcely exclude a reference to the famine which accompanied the siege. On the other hand, one special feature of it is distinctly referred, not to the siege, but to the exile (ver. 13). Starting with the former, the prophet is told to make bread, not of <span class="cmt_word">wheat</span>, the common food of the wealthier class (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-14.htm">Psalm 147:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-8.htm">Jeremiah 41:8</a>), nor of <span class="cmt_word">barley</span>, the chief food of the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>), but of these mixed with <span class="cmt_word">beans</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>), <span class="cmt_word">lentils</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-34.htm">Genesis 25:34</a>) - then, as now, largely used in Egypt and other Eastern countries - <span class="cmt_word">millet</span> (the Hebrew word is not found elsewhere), and <span class="cmt_word">fitches</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> vetches (here also the Hebrew word is found only in this passage, that so translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-25.htm">Isaiah 28:25-27</a> standing, it is said, for the seed of the black cummin). The outcome of this mixture would be a coarse, unpalatable bread, not unlike that to which the population of Paris was reduced in the siege of 1870-71. This was to be the prophet's food, as it was to be that of the people of Jerusalem during the 390 days by which that siege was symbolically, though not numerically, represented. It is not improbable, looking to the prohibition against mixtures of any kind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>, that it would be regarded as in itself unclean. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-17 The bread which was Ezekiel's support, was to be made of coarse grain and pulse mixed together, seldom used except in times of urgent scarcity, and of this he was only to take a small quantity. Thus was figured the extremity to which the Jews were to be reduced during the siege and captivity. Ezekiel does not plead, Lord, from my youth I have been brought up delicately, and never used to any thing like this; but that he had been brought up conscientiously, and never had eaten any thing forbidden by the law. It will be comfortable when we are brought to suffer hardships, if our hearts can witness that we have always been careful to keep even from the appearance of evil. See what woful work sin makes, and acknowledge the righteousness of God herein. Their plenty having been abused to luxury and excess, they were justly punished by famine. When men serve not God with cheerfulness in the abundance of all things, God will make them serve their enemies in the want of all things.</body></html>
