The only power by whom such a siege could be undertaken was Babylon, Egypt having been so thoroughly defeated as to be for a long time out of the question; and Nebuchadnezzar had now, within a few years, thrice completely conquered Judaea, had carried two of its kings, one after the other, captive in chains, and had also taken into captivity 10,000 of the chief of the people, setting up as king over the remnant a creature of his own, who was yet of the royal house of Judah. A fresh siege could only be the result of a fresh rebellion, an act, under the circumstances, of simple infatuation. Yet of this infatuation Zedekiah, through the "anger of the LORD" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-20.htm" title="For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.">2Kings 24:20</a>), was guilty, and thus the prophecy was fulfilled. The prophecy itself is undated, but must have been between the call of Ezekiel in the fifth month of the fifth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a>) and the next date given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>), the sixth month of the sixth year. The siege began, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm" title="And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.">Jeremiah 52:4</a>, in the tenth month of the ninth year, so that the prophecy preceded its fulfilment by only about four years.<p><span class= "bld">Build a fort against it.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a tower. </span>The several acts of a siege are graphically described. First the city is invested; then a tower is built, as was customary, of sufficient height to overlook the walls and thus obtain information of the doings of the besieged. Instruments for throwing stones or darts were also sometimes placed in such towers; next is "cast a mound against it," a common operation of the ancient siege (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-33.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.">Isaiah 37:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-24.htm" title="Behold the mounts, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what you have spoken is come to pass; and, behold, you see it.">Jeremiah 32:24</a>), in which a sort of artificial hill was built to give the besiegers an advantage; then the camps (not merely camp) are set round the city to prevent ingress and egress; and finally "the battering rams" are brought against the walls. These last were heavy beams, headed with iron, and slung in towers, so that they could be swung against the walls with great force. They are frequently to be noticed in the representations of sieges found in the ruins of Nineveh. The practice of forming the end of the beam like a ram's head belongs to the Greeks and Romans; but the instrument itself was much older.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lay siege against it,</span> etc. The wonder would increase as the spectators looked on what followed. Either tracing the scene on the tablet, or, more probably, as ver. 3 seems to indicate, constructing a model of the scene, the prophet brings before their eyes all the familiar details of a siege, such as we see on numerous Assyrian bas-reliefs: such also as the narratives of the Old Testament bring before us. There are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the forts (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-22.htm">Ezekiel 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a>), or, perhaps, the wall of circumvallation, which the besiegers erected that they might carry on their operations in safety; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> then the mount, or mound (the English of the Authorized Version does not distinguish between the two) of earth from which they plied the bows or catapults (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a>; Ezekiel, <span class="accented">ut supra</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="cmt_word">camps</span> (plural in the Hebrew and Revised Version), or encampments, in which they were stationed in various positions found the city; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the <span class="cmt_word">battering rams</span>. Here the history both of the word and the thing has a special interest. The primary meaning of the Hebrew word is "lamb" (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>, <span class="accented">et al</span>., Revised Version), or, better, "full grown wethers or rams" (Furst). Like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:4. 1; 2 Macc. 12:15), and the Latin <span class="accented">aries</span> (Livy, 21:12; 31:32, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), it was transferred to the engine which was used to "butt," like a ram, against the walls of a besieged city, and which, in Roman warfare, commonly terminated in a ram's head in bronze or iron. Ezekiel is the only Old Testament writer who, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-22.htm">Ezekiel 21:22</a>, uses the word, for which the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">arietes.</span> The margin of the Authorized Version in both places gives "chief leaders," taking "rams" in another figurative sense; but, in the face of the LXX. and Vulgate, there is no reason for accepting this. Battering rams frequently appear in Assyrian bas-reliefs of a much earlier date than Ezekiel's time, at Nimroud (Vaux, 'Nineveh and Persepolis,' p. 456), Konyunyik (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 14:0, and elsewhere. They were hung by chains near the bottom of the besiegers' towers, and were propelled against the walls. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 The prophet was to represent the siege of Jerusalem by signs. He was to lie on his left side for a number of days, supposed to be equal to the years from the establishment of idolatry. All that the prophet sets before the children of his people, about the destruction of Jerusalem, is to show that sin is the provoking cause of the ruin of that once flourishing city.</body></html>
