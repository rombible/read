<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-13.htm">Ezekiel 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>) and of his teacher and contemporary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>). The Vulgate represents it by <span class="accented">A, a, a</span>. His plea, which reminds us at once of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a>, is that he has kept himself free from all ceremonial pollution connected with food. And is he, a priest too, to do this? That be far from him! Anything but that! The kinds of defilement of which he speaks are noted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-24.htm">Leviticus 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>.

The prophet's passionate appeal is characteristic of the extent to which his character had been influenced by the newly discovered Law of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34</a>.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably by the Book of Deuteronomy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-17 The bread which was Ezekiel's support, was to be made of coarse grain and pulse mixed together, seldom used except in times of urgent scarcity, and of this he was only to take a small quantity. Thus was figured the extremity to which the Jews were to be reduced during the siege and captivity. Ezekiel does not plead, Lord, from my youth I have been brought up delicately, and never used to any thing like this; but that he had been brought up conscientiously, and never had eaten any thing forbidden by the law. It will be comfortable when we are brought to suffer hardships, if our hearts can witness that we have always been careful to keep even from the appearance of evil. See what woful work sin makes, and acknowledge the righteousness of God herein. Their plenty having been abused to luxury and excess, they were justly punished by famine. When men serve not God with cheerfulness in the abundance of all things, God will make them serve their enemies in the want of all things.</body></html>
