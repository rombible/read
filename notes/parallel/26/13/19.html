<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-3.htm" title="And take with you ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell you what shall become of the child.">1Kings 14:3</a>); but as barley was a cheap grain, and handfuls a very small quantity, these words show the exceedingly small gains for which these false prophetesses were willing to pervert the truth, and lead the people to destruction. God was "polluted" by attaching His name and authority to that which was not true, and would not come to pass, thus "making Him a liar" like themselves. Like all falsehood, their lies tended both ways--to entice the upright to their ruin, and to give false security to the wicked. It is always impossible that a perversion of the truth, especially in regard to the Divine judgments, can be harmless.<p><span class= "bld">Hear your lies.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">hearken to a lie. </span>The words imply a willingness to listen to the pleasing falsehood, and the state of things is that described by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-31.htm" title="The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end thereof?">Jeremiah 5:31</a>. "The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it so."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will ye pollute me</span>, etc.? rather, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">ye have profaned</span>, the interrogative form not being continued in the Hebrew. The prophet dwells with scorn on the miserable pay for which the prophetesses were guilty of so great a sin. Not for rewards of divination, like those of Balsam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a>), but for gifts like those bestowed on the harlot or the beggar (l <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread</span> - they plied their wretched trade. For examples of the lower gifts in kind offered to prophets, compare those of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-8.htm">1 Samuel 9:8</a>), of Jeroboam's wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>), the false prophets in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>. And they did this in direct opposition to the will of Jehovah. They "slew," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> drew on to destruction, the souls that were meant for life. They "saved the souls alive," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "their own, which were worthy of death." That was the outcome of their "lying" divinations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:17-23 It is ill with those who had rather hear pleasing lies than unpleasing truths. The false prophetesses tried to make people secure, signified by laying them at ease, and to make them proud, signified by the finery laid on their heads. They shall be confounded in their attempts, and God's people shall be delivered out of their hands. It behoves Christians to keep close to the word of God, and in every thing to seek the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Let us so trust the promises of God as to keep his commandments.</body></html>
