True prophetesses, as in the case of Miriam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>), Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>), and, at this very time, Huldah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-22.htm" title="And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.">2Chronicles 34:22</a>), and somewhat later, Noadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm" title="My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:14</a>), are frequently spoken of, and continued to exist in New Testament times, as in the case of Anna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>). It was naturally to be expected that as false prophets dogged the steps of the true, the same thing would happen with the other sex, and we find express mention of a false prophetess in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>. Their course, in prophesying "out of their own heart" deceiving the people, was essentially the same as that of the false prophets; but they are described as doing this in ways suited to their sex. Of the general meaning of this description there can be no doubt; but it is difficult to follow it with certainty in the details, because of the occurrence of some words of uncertain meaning, found nowhere else, and of some others in an unusual sense. Without attempting a discussion of each single word, (which would be useless except with a careful examination of the original), the following is given as the most probable translation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/13-18.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and will you save the souls alive that come to you?">Ezekiel 13:18-21</a>; but it is to be remembered that several of the words, like the similar ones in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/3-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>, are so uncertain that there is a difference of opinion in regard to their exact meaning :--"Woe to those who fasten charms on every finger-joint, that place kerchiefs on heads of every height to snare souls. Will ye snare the souls of my people, and keep your own souls alive? (19) And will ye profane me with my people for handfuls of barley, and for pieces of bread, to slay souls that should not die, and to make live souls that should not live, by your lying to my people who hearken to a lie? (20) Therefore, thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against your charms, when ye snare the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, the souls that ye are snaring like birds. (21) Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be snared; and ye shall know that I am the Lord." (<span class= "ital">See Excursus 8 </span>at the end of this book, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/13-6.htm" title="They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD said: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.">Ezekiel 13:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-14.htm" title="So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in the middle thereof: and you shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 13:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thy face against the daughters of thy people.</span> Here we note that the formula, "thy people," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11</a> reappears. The section which follows (vers. 17-23) throws an interesting side light on the position of women in the religious life of Israel. For good as for evil, their influence was stronger there than in most other nations. Miriam had led the way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>), and had been followed by Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). Huldah had been almost as prominent in Josiah's reformation as Hilkiah the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-22.htm">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>). It was but natural that there should be women on the other side also, guiding their own sex; and it is probable that Ezekiel had in his thoughts some special leaders who headed the women of Jerusalem in their opposition to Jeremiah, as afterwards at Pathros (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>). So, later on, we have the prophetess Noadiah heading the opposition to Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and in the New Testament, on the one hand, Anns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) and the daughters of Philip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>), and on the other, the ill-regulated prophetesses of Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>) and the woman Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:17-23 It is ill with those who had rather hear pleasing lies than unpleasing truths. The false prophetesses tried to make people secure, signified by laying them at ease, and to make them proud, signified by the finery laid on their heads. They shall be confounded in their attempts, and God's people shall be delivered out of their hands. It behoves Christians to keep close to the word of God, and in every thing to seek the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Let us so trust the promises of God as to keep his commandments.</body></html>
