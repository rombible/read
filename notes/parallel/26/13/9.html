The several clauses are intended to emphasise the utter exclusion of the false prophets from the people of God: they shall not be in the congregation; their names shall not be written in the genealogical registers of Israel; they shall not even enter the land when the purified and repentant people should once more return.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine hand shall be,</span> etc. After Ezekiel's manner, the thought of ver. 6 is repeated in an altered form in vers. 7, 8. What had been a statement appears as a question to which there could be but one answer. The prophet, as it were, cross examines his rivals. Could they deny the charge? Was not every word of it true? Then, after the statement of the sin of the false prophets, comes the proclamation of the punishment. The hand of Jehovah would be upon them for evil and not for good. <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of my people.</span> The Hebrew word indicates not a large popular gathering, but a secret council of those who deliberate together to carry out their plans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>). The prophets who had acted together, and been looked up to by the people as forming such a council, should lose that position of authority. The words that follow point to a yet lower degradation. They should be in the strictest sense of the word excommunicated. The city of Jerusalem, perhaps every city of Judah, had its register of citizens. In such a register were inscribed also the names of proselytes of other races (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>), and so men came to think of a like register as kept by the King of kings, containing the names of those who were heirs of the "life" of the true Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). In neither of those registers, the earthly and the heavenly (but stress is probably laid upon the former), shall the false prophets find a place. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a> gives an example of the use made of such registers on the return from the Captivity. One notes the contrast between the "<span class="accented">my</span> people" which recognizes Israel as still the heritage of Jehovah, and the "<span class="accented">thy</span> people" used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11</a> of the rebellious house of the Captivity. For the false prophets there should be no return to the <span class="cmt_word">land of Israel</span> such as that which the prophet anticipated for the faithful and the penitent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>). Here there is no specific mention of the name being struck out. The prophet contemplates a new register, in which their names will never even have appeared. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 Where God gives a warrant to do any thing, he gives wisdom. What they delivered was not what they had seen or heard, as that is which the ministers of Christ deliver. They were not praying prophets, had no intercourse with Heaven; they contrived how to please people, not how to do them good; they stood not against sin. They flattered people into vain hopes. Such widen the breach, by causing men to think themselves deserving of eternal life, when the wrath of God abides upon them.</body></html>
