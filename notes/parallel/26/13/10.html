One of the false prophets would build a wall, set up of his own device--some vision as a defence against the warnings of calamity; and his fellows would join in his deceit by covering this wall "with untempered mortar." The word is not the usual one for plaster, and indeed is used in this sense only in these verses and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-28.htm" title="And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus said the Lord GOD, when the LORD has not spoken.">Ezekiel 22:28</a>.

Calvin understands it of mortar mixed with sand and water only, the lime being left out. It is still a common practice in the East, as it has always been, to cover over their walls with stucco. In this case the other false prophets are represented as joining with the one who built the wall by covering over its weaknesses and defects with a fair-seeming plaster. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like to white washed sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm" title="Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?">Acts 23:3</a>.) They helped on the delusion by giving it the weight of their influence, and persuading the people to believe a lie.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peace, when there was no peace.</span> This, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>, was the root evil of the false prophet's work. He lulled men into a false security, and so narcotized their consciences. <span class="cmt_word">One built up a wall.</span> The imagery starts from the picture of a ruined city already implied in vers. 4 and 5, and expands into a parable in which we note a parallelism <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Isaiah's picture of dishonest and unsafe building (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-13.htm">Ezekiel 30:13</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to our Lord's parable at the end of the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24, 25</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47-49</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With an incisive sarcasm, Ezekiel describes what we should call the "scamp-work" of their spiritual building. They profess to be "repairers of the breach" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>) in the walls of the spiritual Zion, and this is how they set about it. <span class="accented">One built up a wall.</span> This may point to a false prophet, but the "one" (Hebrew, "he") is probably indefinite, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>, equivalent to "some one." Some scheme is devised, an Egyptian alliance or the like, to which the people look for safety. It is, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, a "slight wall," such as was used for partition walls inside houses. They make it do duty as an outside wall (<span class="accented">kir</span> in ver. 12). It has no sure "footings," and materials and workmanship are alike defective. The false prophets would smear it over <span class="cmt_word">with untempered</span> mortar (the Hebrew word is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-28.htm">Ezekiel 22:28</a>, and is probably an example of Ezekiel's acquaintance with the technical vocabulary of his time) - with a stucco or plaster, which is hardly better than whitewash (compare the "whitened" or plastered wall or sepulchre of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>), used to hide its detects and give it a semblance of solidity. They come, that is, with smooth words and promises of peace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:10-16 One false prophet built the wall, set up the notion that Jerusalem should be victorious, and made himself acceptable by it. Others made the matter yet more plausible and promising; they daubed the wall which the first had built; but they would, ere long, be undeceived when their work was beaten down by the storm of God's just wrath; when the Chaldean army desolated the land. Hopes of peace and happiness, not warranted by the word of God, will cheat men; like a wall well daubed, but ill built.</body></html>
