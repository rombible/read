It may be that in this case the prophets and prophetesses were untrue to their own convictions, and wilfully declared what they knew to be false; or it may be that they simply uttered as God's message that which they had persuaded themselves would be the issue. This point is not entirely clear from the passage, and is of secondary importance. What deserves to be carefully noted is the difference here made between subjective views of truth--that which conies "out of their own heart"--and those objective communications which God gave to His true prophets. This distinction has a most important bearing upon the whole subject of revelation, and establishes clearly the fact that the Scriptures look upon it as something expressly communicated to their writers, and not as a thing which could be the result of their own thought and reflection. He, therefore, who puts "Thus saith the Lord" before that which God has not in some objective way made known <span class= "ital">to</span> him, must fall under the condemnation pronounced here and elsewhere upon "the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-20.htm" title="But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord saith.</span> The verb is that specially used for the utterance of prophets, and the deceivers used it without the authority of a true mission. <span class="cmt_word">For they have made others</span> (or, <span class="accented">men</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to hope,</span> etc., as in the Authorized Version and Revised Version, read, with the margin of Revised Version, <span class="accented">they hope to confirm their word</span>, taking the verb as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43, 49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">persereraverunt confirmare.</span> Through deceiving others, they came to deceive themselves, and were really expecting a fulfilment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 Where God gives a warrant to do any thing, he gives wisdom. What they delivered was not what they had seen or heard, as that is which the ministers of Christ deliver. They were not praying prophets, had no intercourse with Heaven; they contrived how to please people, not how to do them good; they stood not against sin. They flattered people into vain hopes. Such widen the breach, by causing men to think themselves deserving of eternal life, when the wrath of God abides upon them.</body></html>
