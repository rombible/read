The fox is cunning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-32.htm">Luke 13:32</a>, where the term is applied to Herod Antipas). It spoils the vine and its fruits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>); it burrows among ruins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-18.htm">Lamentations 5:18</a>). So the false prophets were crafty, laid waste the vineyard of the Lord of hosts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>), made their profit out of the ruin of Israel, and made that ruin worse. The 'Reineke Fuchs,' in satirizing the monks and priests of the sixteenth century under the same comparison, presents a curious, though probably unconscious, analogue. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a> wolves appear as the types of the false prophet. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 Where God gives a warrant to do any thing, he gives wisdom. What they delivered was not what they had seen or heard, as that is which the ministers of Christ deliver. They were not praying prophets, had no intercourse with Heaven; they contrived how to please people, not how to do them good; they stood not against sin. They flattered people into vain hopes. Such widen the breach, by causing men to think themselves deserving of eternal life, when the wrath of God abides upon them.</body></html>
