The <span class="accented">nabiim</span> are also the <span class="accented">n'balim.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 Where God gives a warrant to do any thing, he gives wisdom. What they delivered was not what they had seen or heard, as that is which the ministers of Christ deliver. They were not praying prophets, had no intercourse with Heaven; they contrived how to please people, not how to do them good; they stood not against sin. They flattered people into vain hopes. Such widen the breach, by causing men to think themselves deserving of eternal life, when the wrath of God abides upon them.</body></html>
