but they profaned it by the very fact of their captivity, the consequence of their former sins. The heathen regarded Jehovah as merely the national God of the Israelites, and seeing them dispersed, in distress, and in captivity, concluded that He was unable to protect them. Hence, for the vindication of His name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-21.htm" title="But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, where they went.">Ezekiel 36:21-24</a>) God would restore His people to their land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They profaned my holy Name</span>; or, <span class="accented">the name of my holiness</span>. According to Kliefoth, the subject of the verb is "the heathen," but expositors generally regard it as "the house of Israel" of ver. 17. Plumptre thinks that "while grammatically the words may refer to either the heathen or the exiles of Israel, possibly the sentence was purposely left vague, so as to describe the fact in which both were sharers," and cites in support of this view similar constructions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>. What led to the profanation of Jehovah's Name by the heathen was the arrival among them, not of the news of the calamity which had befallen Israel (Kliefoth, Hengstenberg), but of the house of Israel itself; and the actual profanation lay in this, that, having beheld the exiles, they said, <span class="cmt_word">These are the people of the Lord, and they are gone forth out of his land.</span> As the heathen recognized only local divinities, they concluded Jehovah had either behaved capriciously towards his people and east them off (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-40.htm">Jeremiah 23:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>), or had proved unequal to the task of protecting them so that they had been driven off (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>). In either case, the honor of Jehovah had been lessened in the minds and tarnished by the words of the heathen, and inasmuch as this result had been brought about by Israel's sin, on Israel properly the blame lay. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:16-24 The restoration of that people, being typical of our redemption by Christ, shows that the end aimed at in our salvation is the glory of God. The sin of a people defiles their land; renders it abominable to God, and uncomfortable to themselves. God's holy name is his great name; his holiness is his greatness, nor does any thing else make a man truly great.</body></html>
