As the Jews who returned from Babylon did not permanently dwell in the land, but were again ejected from it, the promise contained in these words must be viewed as having been conditional on the realization of the moral and spiritual purity above described. If, therefore, it be aroused that inasmuch as this promise must be fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>), the Jews must yet be restored to Palestine, the reply is that their return can only take place when they have been converted to Christianity; so that the whole promise must be regarded as receiving its highest fulfillment in the experiences of the Church of Christ. That this view is correct is vouched for by the fact that the words, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall be my people and I will be your God</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-22.htm">Jeremiah 30:22</a>), descriptive of the covenant relationship in which Jehovah stood towards Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17, 18</a>), have been chosen by New Testament writers to set forth the relationship of God towards the Christian Church, first here on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16-18</a>), and afterwards in the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:25-38 Water is an emblem of the cleansing our polluted souls from sin. But no water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers in every age.</body></html>
