He speaks primarily of the cleansing from idolatry and such gross outward sins, and he treats of the people collectively; yet this purification, as the following verses show, must necessarily extend much farther, and be applied to them individually. It was the same symbolism which led in later ages to the use of baptism in the admission of proselytes to the Jewish Church, a practice adopted by the forerunner of our Lord in the preparation of the people for His coming. Baptism is also alluded to by our Lord Himself in His conversation with Nicodemus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>.) and afterwards established by Him as the initiatory sacrament of the Christian Church. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I will sprinkle clean water upon you</span>. The second step in the sanctification of Jehovah's Name, and one absolutely necessary to render the preceding either permanent or valuable, was the moral renovation of the people; and in this the first stage was the forgiveness of the people's sins. The image under which this is set forth, "sprinkling with clean water," would naturally present itself to a priest-prophet such as Ezekiel. Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hengstenberg, and others suppose the allusion to be to the water of purification prepared by mixing running water with the ashes of a red heifer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-17.htm">Numbers 19:17-19</a>), and in the account given of this rite the verb for "sprinkle" is that used by Ezekiel, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>. Havernick prefers the rite performed in the consecration of the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-7.htm">Numbers 8:7, 21</a>). Smend, who holds the priest-code had no existence in Ezekiel's day, traces the image to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-2.htm">Psalm 51:2</a>, though he also cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>. Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Currey think of the lustrations of the Law in general; and perhaps this best explains the prophet's language, since the element sprinkled is not "blood" or "water mixed with ashes," but "clean water," "the best known means of purification" (Schroder). As to whether legal or moral cleansing were intended by the prophet, possibly Ezekiel drew no sharp distinction between the two, such as the New Testament draws between justification and sanctification; if he did, then the figure in the text must be taken as alluding rather to the former than to the latter - rather to the forgiveness of Israel's sin than to the regeneration of Israel's heart, which is next referred to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:25-38 Water is an emblem of the cleansing our polluted souls from sin. But no water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers in every age.</body></html>
