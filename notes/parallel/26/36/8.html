Keil and Plumptre make the subject of the verb the material blessings in which Israel's prosperity is depicted as consisting, viz. the foliage and fruit her mountains were soon to bear for the people of Jehovah. The majority of expositors believe the subject to be the people whose return from exile was in this way declared to be approaching. Nor is there any reason why Ezekiel should not have represented the return from exile as an event soon to take place, since of the seventy years of captivity predicted by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>) at least twenty years had passed, if its commencement be dated from the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>); and the fulfillment of Jehovah's promise was to the prophet so much a matter of certainty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>) that his fervent imagination conceived it as at hand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-15 Those who put contempt and reproach on God's people, will have them turned on themselves. God promises favour to his Israel. We have no reason to complain, if the more unkind men are, the more kind God is. They shall come again to their own border. It was a type of the heavenly Canaan, of which all God's children are heirs, and into which they all shall be brought together. And when God returns in mercy to a people who return to him in duty, all their grievances will be set right. The full completion of this prophecy must be in some future event.</body></html>
