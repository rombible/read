"The land" is always regarded in Scripture as peculiarly consecrated to God, and defiled by the sin of the people. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-28.htm" title="That the land spew not you out also, when you defile it, as it spewed out the nations that were before you.">Leviticus 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-34.htm" title="Defile not therefore the land which you shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.">Numbers 35:34</a>.) The comparison is with a woman who has been set apart for uncleanness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm" title="And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:19</a>), who until her purification was not allowed to come into the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their way was before me</span>. Their ways and doings, i.e. their violent deeds and idolatrous practices (ver. 18), were as morally loathsome in Jehovah's sight as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation was materially disgusting. The comparison may have been derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, but was as likely to have been original, seeing Ezekiel was a priest-prophet, to whom the details of the Levitical Law must have been familiar (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:16-24 The restoration of that people, being typical of our redemption by Christ, shows that the end aimed at in our salvation is the glory of God. The sin of a people defiles their land; renders it abominable to God, and uncomfortable to themselves. God's holy name is his great name; his holiness is his greatness, nor does any thing else make a man truly great.</body></html>
