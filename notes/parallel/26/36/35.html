The thought of the first Paradise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), in the historicity of which clearly Ezekiel believed, was one on which his mind often dwelt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a>) as an ideal of earthly beauty and fertility which should recur in the closing age of the world - a hope which appears to have been shared by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>), and taken up by John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1-3</a>). In the day when that hope should be realized for Israel, the <span class="cmt_word">waste, desolate, and ruined cities</span>, on which the passers-by who visited Palestine gazed, should be <span class="cmt_word">fenced and inhabited</span>; literally, <span class="accented">inhabited as fortresses</span>. The three predicates, "waste," "desolate," and" ruined," have been distinguished as signifying "stripped of its inhabitants," "untilled in its lands," and "broken down in its buildings;" in contrast with which, in the golden era of the future, the towns should be inhabited, the fields tilled, and the ruined fortresses built. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:25-38 Water is an emblem of the cleansing our polluted souls from sin. But no water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers in every age.</body></html>
