Two verbs are used, each of them twice ("bereave" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-14.htm" title="Therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your nations any more, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 36:14</a> should be <span class= "ital">cause to fall,</span> as in margin), one of them meaning to <span class= "ital">bereave,</span> the other to <span class= "ital">cause to fall;</span> and these verbs have the same radical letters, but with the first two of them transposed.<p>In reviewing this whole prophecy (Eze 35:1 to Eze 36:15), it is evident that the time had in view by the prophet was one in which Edom still existed as a nation, and was rejoicing in the fall of Israel. It cannot, therefore, look forward to any literal, but still future, accomplishment, since Edom, as a nation, has long since disappeared; and no future people, occupying the same territory or bearing the same name, could possibly sustain the same historic relations to Israel as are here attributed to Edom. Whatever, therefore, is to be literally understood in the prophecy must have been long ago fulfilled. And this was much. Israel was restored to its land, and there greatly multiplied, so that the country became for ages one of the most fertile and prosperous in Asia. At the same time, the sinfulness of the people, as of old, hindered the fulness of blessing that was within their reach. But a small part of them availed themselves of the opportunity to return to their land; and they who did so suffered themselves so to live that when the crowning blessing of the ages was fulfilled in the coming of the Messiah, the mass of the nation rejected and crucified Him. The blessings promised were fulfilled literally as far as the sinfulness of the people allowed; but inasmuch as these prevented anything like the full realisation of the terms of the prophecy, and as no future realisation of these is possible, on account of the total change of conditions and circumstances, it is plain that under these earthly terms the prophet, like his predecessors, Isaiah and the others, sets forth the glories of the spiritual future, and uses earthly blessings as the types of those better ones which are heavenly.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-16.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 36:16-38</a> constitute a separate prophecy, but one closely connected with that which has gone before. It is here declared that Israel has been scattered among the heathen because they had defiled the land by their sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-16.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 36:16-19</a>); then, that although they had yet further profaned God's name among the heathen, He yet had pity for that name's sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-20.htm" title="And when they entered to the heathen, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.">Ezekiel 36:20-23</a>); and, accordingly, that He will gather and restore Israel, cleansing them from their sins, and giving them a heart to keep His commandments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-24.htm" title="For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.">Ezekiel 36:24-32</a>); and in consequence of this change that He will greatly bless them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-35.htm" title="And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.">Ezekiel 36:35-38</a>). The great point of the prophecy is the moral change foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-31.htm" title="Then shall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.">Ezekiel 36:31</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I cause men to hear in thee</span> - <span class="accented">let thee hear</span>, <span class="accented">proclaim against thee</span> (Revised Version); or literally, <span class="accented">cause to be heard against thee - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the shame of the heathen any more</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the contemptuous speech uttered against thee by the heathen, equivalent to <span class="cmt_word">the reproach of the people</span>; or, <span class="accented">peoples; i.e.</span> the reproach cast upon thee by the nations (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-57.htm">Ezekiel 16:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-4.htm">Ezekiel 22:4</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>), rather than, as Curtsy suggests, the reproach cast upon thee by thy rightful possessors for want of fertility. This prophecy clearly looked beyond the return from exile under Zerubbabel and Joshua, Ezra and Neherajah, since under these leaders only a portion of the whole house of Israel re<span class="accented">established</span> themselves in Canaan, while the land was often afterwards subjected to reproach and oppression under heathen powers. At the same time, the homecoming from Babylon and the prosperity that ensued thereupon were partial fulfillments of the <span class="accented">blessings</span> here promised. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-15 Those who put contempt and reproach on God's people, will have them turned on themselves. God promises favour to his Israel. We have no reason to complain, if the more unkind men are, the more kind God is. They shall come again to their own border. It was a type of the heavenly Canaan, of which all God's children are heirs, and into which they all shall be brought together. And when God returns in mercy to a people who return to him in duty, all their grievances will be set right. The full completion of this prophecy must be in some future event.</body></html>
