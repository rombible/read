In the previous clause the words, "have swallowed you up," should rather be "pant for you," the word being taken from the snuffing and panting of wild beasts.

Ewald calls attention to the fivefold repetition of this conjunction, saying, "It repeats itself five times, the reasons [for God's judgments] against these enemies thrusting themselves forward, before the discourse calmly dwells upon the mountains of Israel, of which it is strictly intended to treat." As it were, the prophet's emotion is so strong, and his indignation against Israel's enemies so vehement, that, though he three times in succession begins to prophesy to the mountains of Israel, he on each occasion breaks off before he can get his message told, to expatiate upon the wickedness of Israel's foes. In the prophet's estimation that wickedness was so heinous as to inevitably carry in its bosom appropriate retribution. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> - literally, <span class="accented">because and because</span>, or <span class="accented">even because</span>, a reduplication for the sake of emphasis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> - <span class="cmt_word">they have made you desolate</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and swallowed you up on every side</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wasting of and panting after you</span> (are) <span class="accented">round about</span>.

Keil sees in "the tongue" a personification for the "tongue-man" or talker of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a>; and Gesenius considers the two clauses as tautological. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-15 Those who put contempt and reproach on God's people, will have them turned on themselves.

It was a type of the heavenly Canaan, of which all God's children are heirs, and into which they all shall be brought together. And when God returns in mercy to a people who return to him in duty, all their grievances will be set right. The full completion of this prophecy must be in some future event.</body></html>
