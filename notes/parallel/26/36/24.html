The first step in the sanctification of Jehovah's Name. A promise already given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41, 42</a>), and afterwards repeated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>). The mention of "all countries" shows the prophet's gaze to have been directed beyond the present or immediate future. The Israel of Ezekiel's time had not been scattered among and could not be gathered from all, countries; yet in the years that have passed since then Ezekiel's language as to Israel's dispersion has been literally fulfilled. Wherefore the inference is reasonable that the reassembling to which Ezekiel refers is an event that has not yet occurred, at least in its fullest measure and degree, but will only then be realized completely and finally when the scattered members of the house of Israel shall have been received into the Christian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25, 26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:16-24 The restoration of that people, being typical of our redemption by Christ, shows that the end aimed at in our salvation is the glory of God. The sin of a people defiles their land; renders it abominable to God, and uncomfortable to themselves. God's holy name is his great name; his holiness is his greatness, nor does any thing else make a man truly great.</body></html>
