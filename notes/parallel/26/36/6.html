"The law [of retribution] is demanded by the absolute righteousness of God. The judicial visitations of God cannot possibly be one-sided. Punishment can so much the less strike Israel alone, as precisely in its punishment the deep degradation of heathendom, its apostasy from God and its pride, has set itself forth in the most striking way" (Havernick). The certainty that this law would operate in the case of the heathen no less than in that of Israel, the prophet expresses by representing Jehovah as <span class="cmt_word">having lifted up his hand</span>, or sworn that it should be so (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5, 6, 15, 23, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; and Virgil, 'AEneid,' 12:195, "Teaditque ad sidera dextram"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-15 Those who put contempt and reproach on God's people, will have them turned on themselves. God promises favour to his Israel. We have no reason to complain, if the more unkind men are, the more kind God is. They shall come again to their own border. It was a type of the heavenly Canaan, of which all God's children are heirs, and into which they all shall be brought together. And when God returns in mercy to a people who return to him in duty, all their grievances will be set right. The full completion of this prophecy must be in some future event.</body></html>
