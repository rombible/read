With this prophetic preaching of the Gospel comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, and particularly the connection of that passage with the temporal promises in its continuation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-35.htm" title="And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.">Ezekiel 36:35-38</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.</span> The third step in the progress of sanctifying Jehovah's Name (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, where a similar promise is made, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>, where the new heart is represented as a thing Israel must make for herself). This antinomy frequently occurs in Scripture, which never shrinks from holding man responsible for the production of that, as e.g. faith, for which he is incompetent without the help of Divine grace. Besides the cleansing of her guilt and her restitution in consequence to Jehovah's favor, Israel is promised such an inward renovation of her moral and spiritual disposition as to secure that she shall in future adhere to the worship and service of Jehovah. This change is described in a fourfold way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Negatively</span>, as a removal of the old, stony, unsusceptible heart, which had remained impervious to all appeals and insertsible to all higher feelings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Positively</span>, as a new heart and a new spirit, called elsewhere "one heart" and "a heart of flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39</a>), "a heart to know God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Causally</span>, its existence being traced to the indwelling of God's Spirit, who writes God's Law upon the new heart, and inclines it to a life of obedience thereto (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">Practically</span>, by its manifestation, walking in God's statutes and keeping God s judgments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>). The account here furnished of the moral and spiritual change proposed to be inwrought on Israel cot-responds exactly with that given in the New Testament of the regeneration of the individual soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2, 5, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:25-38 Water is an emblem of the cleansing our polluted souls from sin. But no water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers in every age.</body></html>
