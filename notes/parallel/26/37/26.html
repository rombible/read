Even John the Baptist had said, "God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham"; but our Lord more emphatically taught that the true children of Abraham were those who followed Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.">John 8:39</a>, &c.); while His Apostle St. Paul explains repeatedly, and at length, that Abraham was the father of all those who walk in his faith, whether they be of the circumcision or the uncircumcision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm" title="And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.">Romans 4:12</a>, &c.); and again, "that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a>). Thus was fulfilled the promise that he should be "the father of many nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm" title="Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made you.">Genesis 17:5</a>, interpreted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.">Romans 4:17</a>), and in the same way also was to be fulfilled the present promise of the multiplication of the seed of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - With the people thus gathered (ver. 21), united (ver. 22), purified (ver. 23), and established under the rule of Messiah (ver. 25), Jehovah makes a <span class="cmt_word">covenant of peace</span> (see on Ezekiel 34:25; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>), further characterized as <span class="cmt_word">an everlasting covenant</span>; or, <span class="accented">covenant of eternity</span> (see on Ezekiel 16:60; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-40.htm">Jeremiah 32:40</a>); which guarantees the continuance between him and them of undying friendship, conjoined with the bestowment on his part and the enjoyment on theirs of the highest social and religious blessings. First, national existence and secure possession of the soil. <span class="cmt_word">I will place</span> (literally, <span class="accented">give</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>them</span>, either to their land, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a> (Smend), or to be a nation (Keil), or perhaps both (Kliefoth). Next, steady increase of population - <span class="cmt_word">I will multiply them</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm">Ezekiel 36:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9</a>). Thirdly, perpetual residence of Jehovah amongst them, I will set (or, <span class="accented">give</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my sanctuary</span> (<span class="accented">mikdashi</span>, conveying the idea of sanctity) <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of them for evermore</span> (scrap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11</a>); <span class="cmt_word">my tabernacle</span> (<span class="accented">mishkani</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> idea being that of residence or dwelling) <span class="cmt_word">also shall be with them</span>; or, <span class="accented">over</span> them - the figure being derived from the elevated site of the temple, which overhung the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>), and intended to suggest the idea of Jehovah's protecting grace. That this promise was in part implemented by the erection of the second temple in the days of Zerubbabel may be conceded, and also that Ezekiel himself may have looked forward to a literal restoration of the sanctuary; but its highest realization must be sought for, first in the Incarnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), next in God's inhabitation of the Church through the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>), and finally in his tabernacling with redeemed men in the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3, 22</a>). The last blessing specified is the intimate communion of God with his people, and of them with him - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> This, which formed the kernel of the old covenant with Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>), became the essence of the new covenant with the Israel of the restoration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-28.htm">Ezekiel 36:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-22.htm">Jeremiah 30:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-38.htm">Jeremiah 32:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-8.htm">Zechariah 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>), but only attained to complete realization in the relation of Christian believers to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:15-28 This emblem was to show the people, that the Lord would unite Judah and Israel. Christ is the true David, Israel's King of old; and those whom he makes willing in the day of his power, he makes to walk in his judgments, and to keep his statutes. Events yet to come will further explain this prophecy. Nothing has more hindered the success of the gospel than divisions. Let us study to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; let us seek for Divine grace to keep us from detestable things; and let us pray that all nations may be obedient and happy subjects of the Son of David, that the Lord may be our God, and we may be his people for evermore.</body></html>
