In this verse, the occupancy of the land is to be for ever, and the kingship of David is to be for ever; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm" title="Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the middle of them for ever more.">Ezekiel 37:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-28.htm" title="And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the middle of them for ever more.">Ezekiel 37:28</a> the sanctuary is to be "in the midst of them for evermore," and the covenant of peace is to be "an everlasting covenant." Such promises are taken up continually in the New Testament, and explained of the everlasting reign of the King of kings, the Good Shepherd, over His people, and of the Temple of the Holy Ghost in the heart of the believer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">my servant David</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21, 22, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-10.htm">Psalm 144:10</a>), goes back to the Messianic promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, and cannot be satisfactorily explained as signifying the Davidic house (Smend), or as pointing to "a line of true rulers, each faithfully representing the ideal David as the faithful Ruler, the true Shepherd of his people" (Plumptre, on Ezekiel 34:23), inasmuch as Israel, after Ezekiel's day, never possessed any such line of rulers, and certainly no such line continued <span class="cmt_word">forever</span>. The only feasible exegesis is that which understands Jehovah's servant David to be Messiah, or Jesus Christ, of whom the writer to the Hebrews (Hebrews 1:8) says. "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:15-28 This emblem was to show the people, that the Lord would unite Judah and Israel. Christ is the true David, Israel's King of old; and those whom he makes willing in the day of his power, he makes to walk in his judgments, and to keep his statutes. Events yet to come will further explain this prophecy. Nothing has more hindered the success of the gospel than divisions. Let us study to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; let us seek for Divine grace to keep us from detestable things; and let us pray that all nations may be obedient and happy subjects of the Son of David, that the Lord may be our God, and we may be his people for evermore.</body></html>
