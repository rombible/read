After the prophet's mind had so long dwelt upon the desolating campaigns of Nebuchadnezzar, these ghastly reminders of the loss of human life might naturally enter into his thoughts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the Lord was upon me</span>. The absence of the customary "and" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14, 22</a>), wanting only once again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>), appears to indicate something extraordinary and unusual in the prophet's experience. In the words of Ewald, such a never-beheld sight one sees freely (by itself) in a moment of higher inspiration or never;" and that in this whole vision the prophet was the subject of a special and intensified inspiration is evident, not alone from the contents of the vision, but also from the language in which it is recorded. <span class="cmt_word">And carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord.</span> So the Vulgate and Hitzig - a translation which Smend thinks might be justified by an appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>, in which the similar phrase, "Spirit of God (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>)," occurs; though, with Grotius, Havernick, Keil, and others, he prefers the rendering of the LXX., "And Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit." The Revised Version combines the two thus: "And he carried me out in the Spirit of the <span class="accented">Lord</span>." Keil suggests that the words, "of God," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>, were omitted here because of the word "Jehovah" immediately following. <span class="cmt_word">And set me down in the midst of the valley.</span> As the article indicates, the valley in the neighborhood of Tel-Abib, where the prophet received his first instructions concerning his mission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>); although Hengstenberg holds, wrongly we think, that "the valley here has nothing to do with the valley in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>." <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and it</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was full of bones</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of men who had been slaughtered there (ver. 9; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>), and whose corpses had been left unburied upon the face of the plain (ver. 3), so that they were seen by the prophet. Whether these bones were actually in the valley, or merely formed part of the vision, can only be conjectured, though the latter opinion seems the more probable. At the same time, such a plain as is here depicted may well have been a battle-ground on which Assyrian and Chaldean armies had often met. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-14 No created power could restore human bones to life. God alone could cause them to live. Skin and flesh covered them, and the wind was then told to blow upon these bodies; and they were restored to life. The wind was an emblem of the Spirit of God, and represented his quickening powers. The vision was to encourage the desponding Jews; to predict both their restoration after the captivity, and also their recovery from their present and long-continued dispersion. It was also a clear intimation of the resurrection of the dead; and it represents the power and grace of God, in the conversion of the most hopeless sinners to himself. Let us look to Him who will at last open our graves, and bring us forth to judgment, that He may now deliver us from sin, and put his Spirit within us, and keep us by his power, through faith, unto salvation.</body></html>
