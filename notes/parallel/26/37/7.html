The words uttered were without doubt those of vers. 4-6. The effect produced is depicted in its various steps. First, there resulted a noise - literally, a <span class="accented">voice</span> - which the Revisers take to have been "a thundering;" and Havernick, Keil, Smend, and others, "a sound" in general; but which Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Schroder, with more propriety, regard as having been an audible voice, if not, as Kliefoth supposes, the trumpet-blast or "voice of God," which, according to certain New Testament passages, shall precede the resurrection and awaken the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>); perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, the "counterpart" thereof. <span class="cmt_word">Next, a shaking</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); which the Revisers, following Klie-foth, understand to have been an earthquake, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), and Ewald explains as "a peal of thunder running through the entire announcement," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12, 13</a> and Ezekiel 38:19, 20; but which is better interpreted by Keil, Smend, and others as a rustling proceeding from a movement among the bones. Thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the bones came together</span> in the body as a whole, and in particular bone to his bone; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> each <span class="cmt_word">bone to the bone</span> with which it was designed to be united, as e.g. "the upper to the lower part of the arm" (Schroder). <span class="cmt_word">Lastly, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above</span>; or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">there were sinews upon them</span>, <span class="accented">and flesh came up and skin covered them above</span>; precisely as Jehovah had announced to the prophet would take place (ver. 6). Yet, though the external framework of the bodies was finished, there was <span class="cmt_word">no breath in them</span> - <span class="accented">ruach</span> having still the same import as in ver. 5. With this the preliminary stage in the reanimating process terminated. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-14 No created power could restore human bones to life. God alone could cause them to live. Skin and flesh covered them, and the wind was then told to blow upon these bodies; and they were restored to life. The wind was an emblem of the Spirit of God, and represented his quickening powers. The vision was to encourage the desponding Jews; to predict both their restoration after the captivity, and also their recovery from their present and long-continued dispersion. It was also a clear intimation of the resurrection of the dead; and it represents the power and grace of God, in the conversion of the most hopeless sinners to himself. Let us look to Him who will at last open our graves, and bring us forth to judgment, that He may now deliver us from sin, and put his Spirit within us, and keep us by his power, through faith, unto salvation.</body></html>
