It is addressed to the Ammonites, "Return it" (the sword) "into his sheath;" and it means that all resistance will be vain, the coming destruction cannot be averted. And this judgment is to be executed in the Ammonites' own country: they are to be destroyed at home.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I cause it</span>, etc.? The question of the Authorized Version suggests a negative answer, as though the speaker were Jehovah, and the sheath that of his sword. The Revised Version, which translates it, with Keil, the LXX., and the Vulgate, as an imperative, deals with it as addressed to the Ammonites. They am told to sheath their sword; it would be of no avail against the sharp, glittering weapon of Jehovah. Their judgment would soon come on them in their own land, not, as in the case of Judah, in the form of exile (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-1.htm">Ezekiel 25:1-8</a> as an expansion of the prophet's thought). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:28-32 The diviners of the Ammonites made false prophecies of victory.
