Ezekiel sees, as in vision, Nebuchadnezzar and his army on their march. He is told to <span class="cmt_word">appoint</span> (better, make, or mark, as on a brick or tile, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a>) a place where the road bifurcated. Both come from one land, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from Babylon; but from that point onwards one road led to Rabbath, the capital of the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>), the other to Jerusalem. Apparently, the exiles and the people of Judah flattered themselves that the former was the object of the expedition. The answer to that false hope is a vivid picture of what was passing in the council of war which Nebuchadnezzar was holding at that parting of the ways. The prophet sees, as it were, the sign post pointing, as with a hand, to each of the two cities The king consults his soothsayers, and uses divinations. Of these Ezekiel enumerates three: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">He shakes the arrows to and fro</span> (Revised Version). This was known among the Greeks as the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> The arrows were put into a quiver, with names (in this case probably Rabbath and Jerusalem) written on them.

The <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> in this case is not known, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a> point to some such use of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> There remains the sacrifice and the inspection of the liver, familiar alike in Greek, Etrurian, and Roman divination (Cicero, 'De Divin.,' 6:13). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-17 Here is an explanation of the parable in the last chapter. It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it.</body></html>
