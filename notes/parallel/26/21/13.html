The most satisfactory translation is this: "For it (the sword) has been proved (viz., on others), and what if this contemning rod shall be no more?" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the power of the sword of Babylon has already been proved; and the sceptre of Judah, which despises it, shall be clean swept away.

I begin as before with that which seems most probable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Keil: <span class="accented">For the trial is made, and what if the despising sceptre shall riot come?</span> The "despising sceptre" is the kingdom of Judah, and the prophet asks, "What will happen, what extreme of misery is to be looked for, if that kingdom shall not appear, if Judah shall be left without a ruler? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald: <span class="accented">For it is tried</span> - <span class="accented">and what? Whether it is also a soft rod! That will not be</span>. Sc. men will find on trial that the sword of Jehovah is not a soft rod, but the sharpest of all weapons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hengstenberg: <span class="accented">And how? Shall the despising rod that outstript all other punishments not be? i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. shall the sword of Jehovah not do its work effectively? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Cornill, in part following Hitzig, again rewrites the text, and gets the meaning: <span class="accented">How should I judge with favour? They have not turned themselves from their pollution</span>. <span class="accented">They shall find no place</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The Authorized Version inserts t he word "sword," apparently with the meaning that the "trial" will show that the sword of the Lord contemns the rod, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sceptre of Judah, and that that rod shall be no more. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The Authorized Version (margin): <span class="accented">When the trial hath been, what then? Shall not they also belong to the despising rod?</span> may have had a moaning for those who adopted it, but I fail to find it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The Revised Version relegates the Authorized Version text into the margin, and substitutes, For <span class="accented">there is a trial, and what if even the rod that contemneth</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sceptre of Judah) <span class="accented">shall be no more?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The LXX and Vulgate connect "because there is a trial" with the preceding clause, rendering it respectively, "for it has been justified (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)," and "because it has been tested (probatus)," and translate what follows - the LXX., "What if even a tribe be repulsed? It shall not be;" and the Vulgate, "And this when it (the sword!) has overturned the kingdom, and it shall not be," etc. This will be a sufficient summary of the difficulties of the exegetical problem. At the best, we must say that it remains unsolved. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-17 Here is an explanation of the parable in the last chapter. It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it.</body></html>
