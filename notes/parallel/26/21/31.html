but the language immediately falls into another figure, already employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-47.htm" title="And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.">Ezekiel 20:47</a>, "I will blow against thee in" (rather, <span class= "ital">with</span>) "the fire of my wrath." (Comp. the same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-21.htm" title="Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you in the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the middle therof.">Ezekiel 22:21</a>.) The image is that of the consuming fire of God's wrath blown by His power against Ammon, as fire is turned by the wind upon a forest to its destruction. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-16.htm" title="Behold, I have created the smith that blows the coals in the fire, and that brings forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.">Isaiah 54:16</a>.) The word "brutish" of the text in the last clause is better than the "burning" of the margin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will blow against,</span> etc. The imagery of fire takes the place of that of the sword. <span class="cmt_word">The brutish men</span> (same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-6.htm">Psalm 92:6</a>) are the Chaldean conquerors. The fact that the adjective may also mean "those that burn" may, in part, have determined Ezekiel's choice of it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:28-32 The diviners of the Ammonites made false prophecies of victory.

Let us be thankful to be employed as instruments of mercy; let us use our understandings in doing good; and let us stand aloof from men who are only skilful to destroy.</body></html>
