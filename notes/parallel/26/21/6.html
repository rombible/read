He is to act the part of a mourner, whose sighs are so deep that they seem to "break his loins" (compare, for the gesture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1, 10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>).

He is but doing what all would do, when the messenger brought word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>, five years later, that the city was at last smitten. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-17 Here is an explanation of the parable in the last chapter. It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it.</body></html>
