So the three variants of "south" are shown to mean respectively Jerusalem, the holy places, and the land of Israel. So, in ver. 3, the <span class="cmt_word">righteous</span> and the <span class="cmt_word">wicked</span> take the place of the "green" and the "dry" tree, and the fire is explained as meaning the sword of the invader. The teaching of ch. 18, had shown that Ezekiel had entered, as regards the ultimate judgment of individual men, into the spirit of Abram's words "That be far from thee to destroy the righteous with the wicked" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). But in regard to temporal judgments there would be in this case, as in the complaint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>, no distinction. The <span class="cmt_word">sword</span> went forth "against all flesh." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-17 Here is an explanation of the parable in the last chapter. It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it.</body></html>
