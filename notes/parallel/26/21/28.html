This would leave the inference that the Ammonites might escape altogether; and from the destruction of God's peculiar people, along with the immunity of their ancient enemies, the heathen would be likely to draw conclusions inconsistent with the power and majesty of God. Hence this prophecy is added to show that His judgments shall certainly fall on them also, and in this case the ruin foretold is final and hopeless, without the promise given to Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-27.htm" title="I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.">Ezekiel 21:27</a>. Another prophecy against Ammon is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/25-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,">Ezekiel 25:1-7</a>. As a matter of history, the Ammonites were conquered, and their country desolated, by Nebuchadnezzar a few years after the destruction of Jerusalem, and they gradually dwindled away until their name and place among the nations finally disappeared.<p><span class= "bld">Their reproach</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, their exultation in the desolation of Israel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-3.htm" title="And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Because you said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;">Ezekiel 25:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm" title="I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.">Zephaniah 2:8</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God concerning the Ammonites.</span> Ezekiel has not forgotten that scene at the parting of the ways. The Ammonites, when they saw the issue of the divination, and the march of the Chaldean army to the west, thought themselves safe. They took up their reproach against Jerusalem, and exulted in its fall. They are warned, as in another strophe of the "Lay of the Sword of Jehovah," that their confidence is vain (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a> for a like exultation at an earlier period). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:28-32 The diviners of the Ammonites made false prophecies of victory. They would never recover their power, but in time would be wholly forgotten. Let us be thankful to be employed as instruments of mercy; let us use our understandings in doing good; and let us stand aloof from men who are only skilful to destroy.</body></html>
