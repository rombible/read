There is, however, serious difficulty as to the construction and meaning of the clause. The ancient versions and many commentators have more or less changed the text without improvement. The original is obscure in its extreme brevity, and allows "the rod of my son" to be either the object (as it is taken in the text) or the subject (as in the margin). The true sense is probably that which makes the clause into an objection offered <span class= "ital">by </span>the Jew to the prophet's denunciation: "But 'the rod of my son' despiseth every tree;" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Divine promise of old to Judah is sure, and his sceptre must remain whatever power arises against it. The objection was in a certain sense true, but the objectors had little idea of the means by which its truth should be established, and vainly imagined that it gave a temporal security to the kingdom of Judah, whatever might be its sins. The prophet does not notice the objection further than to go on with his prediction of the approaching desolation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sceptre of my son,</span> etc. The clause is obscure, possibly corrupt, and has received many interpretations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Taking the received text, the most probable explanation is that given by Keil and Kliefoth: <span class="accented">Shall we rejoice</span> (saying), <span class="accented">The sceptre of my son despiseth all woods</span>. Here the "rod" is the "sceptre" of the tribe of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), and the words are supposed to be spoken by those who hear of the destroying sword. They need not dread the sword, they say, because the sceptre of the house of David, whom Jehovah recognizes as his son, despises all wood, looks on every other rod that is the symbol of sovereignty, with scorn. It is urged, in favour of this interpretation, that ver. 27 contains an unmistakable refer, nee to the prophetic words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald: <span class="accented">It is no weak rod of my son, the softest of all wood</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sword of Jehovah is no weak weapon such as might be used for the chastisement of a child (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hengstenberg: <span class="accented">Shall we rejoice over the rod of my son, despising every tree?</span> There is no cause for anything but the reverse of joy in the rod, the punishment which God appoints for Israel as his son, and which surpasses all others in its severity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The Authorized Version and Revised Version (margin) make the "sword" the nominative, and the words are those of Jehovah: <span class="accented">It contemneth the rod</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sceptre) <span class="accented">of my son, as it contemns every other tree</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-4.htm">Ezekiel 20:4</a>), <span class="accented">every other national sovereignty</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The Revised. Version and Authorized Version (margin): <span class="accented">It</span> (the sword) <span class="accented">is the rod of my son</span> (appointed for his chastisement), <span class="accented">and it despiseth every tree</span>, in same sense as in (4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Cornill, altering the text, almost rewriting it, gets the meaning: <span class="accented">It</span> (the sword) <span class="accented">is for men who murder and plunder, and regard not any strength</span>. Neither the LXX. nor the Vulgate help us, the former giving, "Slay, set at naught, reject every tree;" and the latter, "Thou who guidest the sceptre of my son, thou hast cut down." On the whole, (1) seems to rest on better ground than the others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-17 Here is an explanation of the parable in the last chapter. It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it.</body></html>
