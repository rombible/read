"the foundations" shall be put "out of course," and everything thrown into that condition of flux and change, without permanent settlement, which was so characteristic of the state of Judaea until the coming of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Until he come whose right it is.--</span>This is generally acknowledged as a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>, "until Shiloh come" even by those who reject the interpretation of <span class= "ital">Shiloh </span>as meaning "he to whom it belongs." The promise here made refers plainly both to the priestly and to the royal prerogatives, and a still more distinct foretelling of the union of both in the Messiah may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12-13</a>. In Him, and in Him alone, will all this confusion and uncertainty come to an end; for, as Ezekiel's contemporary declared, "His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed<span class= "ital">" </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will overthrow.</span> The sentence of destruction is emphasized, after the Hebrew manner, by a threefold iteration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be no more.</span> The pronoun in both clauses probably refers to the established order of the kingdom and the priesthood. "That order," Ezekiel says, "shall be no more." Keil, however, takes the second "it" - the "this" of the Revised Version - as meaning the fact of the overthrow. That also was not final; all things were as in a state of flux till the Messianic kingdom hinted at in the next clause should restore the true order. <span class="cmt_word">Until he come whose right it is.</span> The words contain a singularly suggestive allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where a probable interpretation of the word "Shiloh" is "he to whom it belongs;" or, as the LXX. gives it, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;</span>. The passage is noticeable as being Ezekiel's first distinct utterance of the hope of a personal Messiah. Afterwards, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>, it is definite enough. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:18-27 By the Spirit of prophecy Ezekiel foresaw Nebuchadnezzar's march from Babylon, which he would determine by divination. The Lord would overturn the government of Judah, till the coming of Him whose right it is. This seems to foretell the overturnings of the Jewish nation to the present day, and the troubles of states and kingdoms, which shall make way for establishing the Messiah's kingdom throughout the earth. The Lord secretly leads all to adopt his wise designs. And in the midst of the most tremendous warnings of wrath, we still hear of mercy, and some mention of Him through whom mercy is shown to sinful men.</body></html>
