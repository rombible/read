His choice of the former is determined, as he supposes, by his divinations, but really by the overruling hand of the Lord, who thus shows beforehand what it shall be. The whole is set forth in the vivid and concrete imagery so characteristic of Ezekiel; but it is impossible that the scene in real life was to be thus determined by the prophet's open interference. The whole is a vision, in which life and action is conveyed by this manner of describing the course of future events as actually taking place before the eyes of his hearers. The two ways "come forth out of one land;" their starting-point is the same. Babylon, and they diverge towards different destinations.<p><span class= "bld">Choose thou a place.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make a hand </span>or, as we say, <span class= "ital">a finger-post. </span>The verb here used never means "choose," nor does the noun ever mean "place" but the verb is often used both in the sense of <span class= "ital">to make </span>and <span class= "ital">to engrave, </span>and "hand" frequently occurs in the sense of a pillar, and occasionally in that of a guide post. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-12.htm" title="And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.">1Samuel 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm" title="Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.">2Samuel 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-5.htm" title="Even to them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.">Isaiah 56:5</a>.) The prophet in vision sets up this guide-post to direct the king on his march. The roads to Rabbah and to Jerusalem from Babylon would be the same for many hundred miles. It is impossible, therefore, to suppose that Ezekiel actually stood at their parting.<p><span class= "bld">Head of the way, </span>called more poetically in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a> "mother of the way," is the point where the road forks. From this point the road to Jerusalem would lie on the right, that to Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites, on the left.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:18-27 By the Spirit of prophecy Ezekiel foresaw Nebuchadnezzar's march from Babylon, which he would determine by divination. The Lord would overturn the government of Judah, till the coming of Him whose right it is. This seems to foretell the overturnings of the Jewish nation to the present day, and the troubles of states and kingdoms, which shall make way for establishing the Messiah's kingdom throughout the earth. The Lord secretly leads all to adopt his wise designs. And in the midst of the most tremendous warnings of wrath, we still hear of mercy, and some mention of Him through whom mercy is shown to sinful men.</body></html>
