yet, doubtless, there was mingled with this a secret consciousness of the worthlessness of the idolatries which they themselves practised, and a consequent readiness to cast them aside when opposed to their wishes.<p><span class= "bld">To them that have sworn oaths.</span>--These words have been very variously interpreted, but the simplest meaning seems the best; the resolution of Nebuchadnezzar to attack Jerusalem seemed impossible to the Jews, because they were his vassals, and under oaths of fidelity to him. They must have been conscious of their own violation of those oaths, and yet have persuaded themselves that their intrigues with Egypt were not known to Nebuchadnezzar, and that therefore he would not attack them.<p><span class= "bld">But he will call to remembrance the iniquity.</span>--The pronoun is here understood by many as referring to the Lord, and "iniquity" as expressing the general sinfulness of the people. It is better to refer the pronoun <span class= "ital">to </span>Nebuchadnezzar, who will call to remembrance and punish the violation of their oaths to him. It is constantly to be remembered that Zedekiah was placed upon the throne by him under a solemn oath of fidelity to himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm" title="And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm" title="And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.">2Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-3.htm" title="For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm" title="But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that does such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?">Ezekiel 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm" title="Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, see, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, &c).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - The whole verse is obscure, and has been very variously interpreted. I follow the translation of the Revised Version, and explain it by inserting words which are needed to bring out its meaning: <span class="accented">It</span> (what Nebuchadnezzar has done) <span class="accented">shall be as a vain divination in their sight</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. in that of the men of Jerusalem), <span class="accented">which have sworn unto them</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. have taken oaths of fealty to the Chaldeans, and are ready to take them again), <span class="accented">but he</span> (Nebuchadnezzar) <span class="accented">brings iniquity to remembrance</span>. The fact represented is that when the people of Jerusalem heard of the divination at the parting of the ways, they still lulled themselves in a false security. They and Zedekiah had sworn obedience, and that oath would protect them. "Not so," rejoins the prophet; "the Chaldean king knows how those oaths have been kept." The LXX. omits all reference to "oaths." The Vulgate. taking the word for "oath" in its ether sense of "sabbath," gives the curious rendering, <span class="accented">Eritque quasi consulens frustra oraculum in eorum oculis, et sabbatorum otium imitans</span>. In spite of the reports that reached them, the men of Jerusalem thought themselves as safe as if the Chaldean king were keeping a sabbath day. Ewald partly follows the Vulgate, and renders, <span class="accented">They believe they have weeks on weeks</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will not believe that the danger is close at hand. Keil and Havernick: <span class="accented">Oaths of oaths are theirs</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they count on the oath of Jehovah, on his promises of protection, but he (Jehovah) brings iniquity to remembrance. <span class="cmt_word">That they may be taken</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. be seized by the invader and either slain or made prisoners <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:18-27 By the Spirit of prophecy Ezekiel foresaw Nebuchadnezzar's march from Babylon, which he would determine by divination. The Lord would overturn the government of Judah, till the coming of Him whose right it is. This seems to foretell the overturnings of the Jewish nation to the present day, and the troubles of states and kingdoms, which shall make way for establishing the Messiah's kingdom throughout the earth. The Lord secretly leads all to adopt his wise designs. And in the midst of the most tremendous warnings of wrath, we still hear of mercy, and some mention of Him through whom mercy is shown to sinful men.</body></html>
