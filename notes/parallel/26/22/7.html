So the other sins mentioned in this and the following verses are transgressions of special Divine commands. "Dealt by oppression" is "dealt oppressively" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-10.htm" title="And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather every grape of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm" title="You shall neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-14.htm" title="You shall not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of your brothers, or of your strangers that are in your land within your gates:">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>, &c.); for "the father less and widow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22-24</a>, &c.). The despising of holy things and the profanation of the sabbaths were the constant subject of the warnings of the law; tale-bearers are forbidden in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-16.htm" title="You shall not go up and down as a talebearer among your people: neither shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor; I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:16</a>; the "eating upon the mountains" (which means joining in the idol sacrifices) is often reproved by this and the other prophets; and the sins of lewdness enumerated are all specifically forbidden in Leviticus 18, 20, as well as elsewhere; while the various sins arising from covetousness, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm" title="In you have they taken gifts to shed blood; you have taken usury and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten me, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 22:12</a>, had been constantly denounced both by the law and in the warnings of the prophets. The expression "hast forgotten me" is at once the root of all these sins, and in itself the climax of all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - We pass to sins of another kind. The fifth commandment was trampled underfoot as well as the sixth, and the blessing of continued national existence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) was thereby forfeited. The widow and the orphan and the stranger (we note in that last word the width of Ezekiel's sympathies) were oppressed (compare the same grouping in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-16.htm">Deuteronomy 27:16, 19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-16 The prophet is to judge the bloody city; the city of bloods. Jerusalem is so called, because of her crimes. The sins which Jerusalem stands charged with, are exceeding sinful. Murder, idolatry, disobedience to parents, oppression and extortion, profanation of the sabbath and holy things, seventh commandment sins, lewdness and adultery. Unmindfulness of God was at the bottom of all this wickedness. Sinners provoke God because they forget him. Jerusalem has filled the measure of her sins. Those who give up themselves to be ruled by their lusts, will justly be given up to be portioned by them. Those who resolve to be their own masters, let them expect no other happiness than their own hands can furnish; and a miserable portion it will prove.</body></html>
