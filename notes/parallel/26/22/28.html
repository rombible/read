The prophets are here again spoken of in reference to their powerful influence upon the princes in leading them astray by falsehoods. "Seeing vanity" is an expression for pretended and false visions. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-7.htm" title="Have you not seen a vain vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination, whereas you say, The LORD said it; albeit I have not spoken?">Ezekiel 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/13-9.htm" title="And my hand shall be on the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 13:9-10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>.) The fact that the prophets are addressed here gives some force to the idea that "chiefs" or "judges" were addressed in Ver. 27. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:23-31 All orders and degrees of men had helped to fill the measure of the nation's guilt. The people that had any power abused it, and even the buyers and sellers find some way to oppress one another. It bodes ill to a people when judgments are breaking in upon them, and the spirit of prayer is restrained. Let all who fear God, unite to promote his truth and righteousness; as wicked men of every rank and profession plot together to run them down.</body></html>
