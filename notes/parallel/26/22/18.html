<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-29.htm" title="The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melts in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.">Jeremiah 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm" title="And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-3.htm" title="And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer to the LORD an offering in righteousness.">Malachi 3:3</a>). The peculiar appropriateness of this figure has been often noted in the fact that the completion of the process of refining silver in the furnace was determined by the parting of the floating dross and the reflection of the image of the refiner from its molten surface. This figure, while setting forth the punishment of Israel, shows clearly that this punishment was for the purpose of purification.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of Israel is to me become dross</span>, etc. A new parable, based upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22, 23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6.htm">Jeremiah 6</a>:80, begins, and is carried out with considerable fullness. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2, 3</a> we have the same imagery. Baser metals have been mingled with the silver, and must be burnt out, but there is hope, as well as terror, in the parable. Men throw the mixed metals into the smelting-pot in order that the silver may be separated from the dross and come out pure (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). And this was to be the issue of the "fiery trial" through which Jerusalem and its inhabitants were to pass. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:17-22 Israel, compared with other nations, had been as the gold and silver compared with baser metals. But they were now as the refuse that is consumed in the furnace, or thrown away when the silver is refined. Sinners, especially backsliding professors, are, in God's account, useless and fit for nothing. When God brings his own people into the furnace, he sits by them as the refiner by his gold, to see that they are not continued there any longer than is fitting and needful. The dross shall be wholly separated, and the good metal purified. Let those who suffer pains, or lingering sickness, and find that their hearts can scarcely bear these light and momentary afflictions, take warning to flee from the wrath to come; for if these trials are not sanctified by the power of the Holy Spirit, to the cleansing their hearts and hands from sin, far worse things will come upon them.</body></html>
