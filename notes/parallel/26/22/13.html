Unmindfulness of God was at the bottom of all this wickedness. Sinners provoke God because they forget him. Jerusalem has filled the measure of her sins.

Those who resolve to be their own masters, let them expect no other happiness than their own hands can furnish; and a miserable portion it will prove.</body></html>
