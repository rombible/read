Ezekiel 13, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-4.htm" title="Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.">Zephaniah 3:4</a>, and many passages in Jeremiah) as among the most serious obstacles to the work of the true prophets: there is also frequent mention of them in history (1 Kings 22, &c), as they had been foretold from of old in prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/18-20.htm" title="But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>). Nothing, it may be observed, could have afforded more plausible excuse to the people for not obeying the Divine admonitions than an opposing "Thus saith the Lord." The greed of the false prophets and the disastrous effects of their counsel are spoken of here in stronger terms than in any other passage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A conspiracy of prophets</span>. The prophet's thoughts go back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1-16</a>, from which, in Ver. 28, he actually quotes It is probable that, in the interval, fresh tidings had reached him of the evil work which they were doing at Jerusalem. The LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (equivalent to "princes") suggests that they followed a different text, and this is adopted by Keil and Hitzig. <span class="cmt_word">Like a roaring lion</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-2.htm">Ezekiel 19:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The word probably points to the loud declamations of the false prophets (compare, as a striking parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3, 4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:23-31 All orders and degrees of men had helped to fill the measure of the nation's guilt. The people that had any power abused it, and even the buyers and sellers find some way to oppress one another. It bodes ill to a people when judgments are breaking in upon them, and the spirit of prayer is restrained. Let all who fear God, unite to promote his truth and righteousness; as wicked men of every rank and profession plot together to run them down.</body></html>
