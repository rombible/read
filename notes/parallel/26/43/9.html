Ezekiel's theology in this respect harmonizes with that of Old and New Testament writers generally, who invariably postulate purity of heart and life as a necessary condition of God's abiding in the heart, while asserting that such Divine indwelling in the heart is the only certain creator of such purity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-12.htm">Isaiah 26:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
