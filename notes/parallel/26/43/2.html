3:23) <span class="cmt_word">came from the way of the east</span>, as if intending to enter the temple by the very door through which it had previously departed from the temple (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22, 23</a>). The voles which proceeded from the theophany and resembled <span class="cmt_word">the noise of many waters</span>, is after the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) by Keil and Smend understood to have been the sound produced by the motion of the wheels and the rustling of the wings of the cherubim (see on Ezekiel 1:2, 4; 10:5), but is better taken, with Kliefoth and Hengstenberg, to signify the voice of the Almighty himself, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the personal Jehovah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>). The statement that <span class="cmt_word">the earth shined with his glory</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-1.htm">Revelation 18:1</a>) has by Havernick, Kliefoth, and others been supposed to indicate the absence of that "cloud" in which the glory of Jehovah appeared in both the Mosaic tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34, 35</a>) and the Solomonic temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10, 11</a>), and thereby to point to the clearer and more resplendent manifestations of the Godhead, which were to be given in connection with the new dispensation for which Ezekiel's "house" was being prepared. This, however, as Keil has shown, cannot be main-rained in face of the facts that in both Exodus and 1 Kings "the glory of the <span class="accented">Lord"</span> is used synonymously with "the cloud," and that in Ezekiel's vision "the glory" and "the cloud" were alike present (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3, 4</a>). Kliefoth and Schroder hold "the earth" which was illumined to have been "the whole globe," "the entire region of humanity," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>, etc.; but there does not appear ground for departing from the ordinary sense of the words, that "the path" of the advancing God was irradiated by the brilliance of his material glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
