To "fill the hand" is a synonym for consecration, commonly applied to the priests, who were consecrated by placing in their hands the gifts they were to offer to God. Here it is better to keep to the text as it stands, "filling the hand of the altar" being a strong figurative expression to denote that it shall always be supplied with sacrificial gifts. Nothing is said throughout the passage of the consecration of the priests, the whole family of Aaron having been consecrated once for all by the ceremonies of Leviticus 8.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall purge the altar</span>. Smend thinks it strange that only the purification of the altar should be mentioned here, while that of the sanctuary is referred to later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a>), and finds in this an explanation (at least, perhaps) of the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> only the consecration of the Mosaic altar - not of the Mosaic tabernacle - is reported. He conceives it likely that the author of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> copied Ezekiel, but does not explain why Ezekiel may not have copied the author of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they shall consecrate themselves</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">they - i.e.</span> the priests - <span class="accented">shall consecrate it</span>; literally, <span class="accented">fill</span> <span class="accented">its hand</span>. The phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, "to fill one's hand," sc. with gifts, occurs with reference to Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-29.htm">Exodus 32:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-5.htm">1 Chronicles 29:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-31.htm">2 Chronicles 29:31</a>). It is also employed in the sense of filling the hand of another, as e.g. of a priest, with sacrificial gifts, when he is instituted into his sacred office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-27.htm">Leviticus 8:27</a>). Here the hand to be filled is that of the altar, which is personified for the purpose (compare the use of the terms "bosom" and "lip" in connection with the altar). The meaning is that the altar, at its consecration, should have a plentiful supply of gifts, to symbolize that the offering of such gifts was the work for which it was set apart, and that it should never be without them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
