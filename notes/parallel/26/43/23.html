The reason that the burnt offering is not mentioned on the first day is, that the sin offering being changed on the second day, the prophet first describes that for both days, and then goes to the other, which remained the same throughout. Here the burnt offering is a bullock and a ram; in Exodus 29 two rams.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - The presentation of <span class="cmt_word">a burnt offering unto the Lord</span> was the next item in the ritual that should be observed. The material composing it should consist of <span class="cmt_word">a young bullock without blemish</span>, as in the ordinary sacrificial cede (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3, 4, 5</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and a ram out of the flock without blemish</span>, as in the consecration of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>) and of the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-18.htm">Leviticus 8:18</a>). The persons presenting it should be the prophet, <span class="cmt_word">thou</span>, and the priests, <span class="cmt_word">they</span>, as his representatives. The mode of offering should be by burning, the distinctive act in a burnt offering, as that of a sin offering was sprinkling, and that of a peace offering the sacrificial meal, and by casting <span class="cmt_word">salt</span> upon the carcass, a feature in every meat offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>), and here added probably to intensify the idea of purification. "In the corrosive and antiseptic property of salt there is hidden something of the purifying and consuming nature of fire; hence the Redeemer, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>, combines the salting of the sacrifice with the purifying fire of self- denial" (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 145). The significance of it should be an expression of complete self-surrender unto Jehovah, as the necessary outcome of the antecedent act of expiation. The time of its presentation should be immediately after the cleansing of the altar on the second day, and presumably also on the succeeding days. Whether the burnt offering was, as Keil maintains, or was not, as Kliefoth contends, offered also on the first day is difficult to decide, though the former opinion has, perhaps, most in its favor. The Mosaic ritual always enjoined a burnt offering to be offered as a sequel to the sin offering (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14, 18</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14, 18</a>; and see Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 86); and, in accordance with this, vers. 23 and 24 naturally follow on vers. 19-21, ver. 22 being interposed because of the variation in the sin offering for the second day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
