<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation on it.">Leviticus 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-18.htm" title="Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.">Hebrews 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a>. Nothing is here said of the pouring the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar, as required in the law, and nothing of the burning of the fat upon the altar, because the prophet throughout supposes the ritual of the sacrifices to be well known, and only mentions a few particulars to indicate the whole, and also a few others now introduced, peculiar to the new ceremonial.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it</span>. The application of the victim's blood to and upon the altar formed an integral part of every expiatory offering; but "whereas in all the other kinds of sacrifice the blood was poured indifferently round about the altar of the fore court, in the sin offering it was not to be <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>, lest the intention should be overlooked, but <span class="accented">smeared</span> with the finger upon the horns of the altar ('And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34</a>) (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 107). In the present instance the blood was to be carefully put upon <span class="cmt_word">the four horns</span> of the altar - the only part to be smeared with blood in the Mosaic consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">the four corners of the settle</span>, or azarah, but whether the greater or lesser is left undecided, though in all probability it was the under, if not both, and <span class="cmt_word">the border round about</span>, that mentioned in ver. 17; and the effect of this smearing with blood should be to <span class="cmt_word">cleanse and purge</span>, or, <span class="accented">make atonement</span> for, the altar; not for the people, as Havernick interprets, saying, "without an atoned-for altar, no atoned-for people (<span class="accented">ohne entsuhnten Altar</span>, <span class="accented">kein entsuhntes Volk</span>)," but for the altar, either, as Kliefoth suggests, because, being made out of a part of the sinful earth and world, it required to be sanctified, or because, as Plumptre prefers, the sins of the people having been, as it were, transferred to it, it stood in need of cleansing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
