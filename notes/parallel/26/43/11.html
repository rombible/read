the one could not be without the other. Many expressions of nearly the same meaning are heaped up, as it were, in the latter part of this verse, to emphasise the significance of the arrangements of the new Temple, and to secure for them the thought and consideration of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if they be ashamed of all that they have done</span>. This cannot signify that Ezekiel was not to show the house until they had evinced a sincere penitence for past wickedness, since the converse has just been stated, that their repentance should flow from a disclosure to them of the house: but that in the event of the presentation to them of the "well-measured" building awaking in them any disposition of regret and sorrow, then the prophet should proceed to unfold to them its details. He should show them first the form of the house, <span class="accented">i.e. the</span> external shape of the building, and the <span class="cmt_word">fashion thereof</span>, or its well-proportioned and harmonious arrangements; <span class="cmt_word">the goings out thereof,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the comings in thereof</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its exits and entrances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and all the forms thereof</span>; which can only mean the shapes of its several parts; <span class="cmt_word">and all the ordinances thereof</span>, or regulations concerning its use in worship, <span class="cmt_word">and all the forms thereof</span> - the same words as above, and therefore omitted by the LXX. as well as some Hebrew manuscripts, and, after their example, by Dathe, Hitzig, Ewald, Smend, and others, though Keil, Kliefoth, Schroder, and others retain the clause as genuine, and regard it as an illustration of Ezekiel's habit of crowding words together for the sake of emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">and all the laws thereof</span>, by which were probably signified "the instructions contained in these statutes for sanctification of life" (Keil). In addition to rehearsing the above in the hearing of the people, the prophet was directed to <span class="cmt_word">write them in their sight</span>, if it be not open to understand the "writing" as explanatory of the way in which the" showing" was to be made. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
