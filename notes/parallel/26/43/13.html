and the height, one reed.">Ezekiel 40:5</a>). The description that follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/43-13.htm" title="And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.">Ezekiel 43:13-17</a>) will be made clearer by a simple diagram, with references to the parts described. The size of the base of the altar, it will be seen, was 16 cubits square, and its entire height was either 11 or 12 cubits. The altar in Solomon's Temple was of brass, 20 cubits square, and 10 cubits high (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-1.htm" title="Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.">2Chronicles 4:1</a>), while that in the Tabernacle (of shittim-wood overlaid with brass) had been 5 cubits square, and 3 cubits high (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits.">Exodus 27:1</a>). That in Herod's Temple is said to have been 32 cubits square, and 10 cubits high, and was of hewn stone. The dimensions of Ezekiel's altar seem to have been selected for the symmetry of the numbers in the several parts. In height it exceeded any of the others.<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>)Base or "bottom," 1 cubit high, and 1 broad.

This is to be compared with Exodus 40 and Leviticus 8, although in that case the consecration of the altar and of the priests were joined together, while here that of the altar alone is described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-27.</span> - The temple-altar described (vers. 13-17), and the ritual for its consecration explained (vers. 18-27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The measures of the altar</span>. The altar is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, that formerly mentioned as standing in the inner court, immediately in front of the" house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>), the altar of burnt offering, and not the altar of incense in the holy place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>). Its dimensions, then omitted, are now reported in connection with its consecration, which also is narrated as a pendant to that of the "house," because of the intimate connection between the two - the consecration of the altar being practically equivalent to the consecration of the house, and the consecration of the house finding approximate expression in the consecration of the altar. As in the other portions of the temple, so in this, the measurements are given <span class="cmt_word">after the cubits</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by or in cubits, the length of each cubit being noted at "a cubit and an hand-breadth," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>. They are likewise taken first from the foundation upwards (vers. 13-15), and then from the top downwards (vers. 16, 17). The first portion measured <span class="cmt_word">is the bottom</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the bosom</span> (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;</span>, "that which embraces," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span> "to embrace;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">sinus</span>); but what exactly that signified is debated among interpreters. Gesenius thinks of "the hollowed part for the fire;" Hitzig, of "a frame running round, a stand in which the altar stood;" Kliefoth, of "a deepening on the wooden ring in which the whole altar stands;" Keil, of" a lower hollow or base of the altar, formed by a border of a definite height;" Smend, of "the channel or gutter of the altar base, which should receive the sacrificial blood;" Havernick, Currey, and Plumptre, of "a base upon which the altar stood." If Smend's feasible notion be not adopted, then probably that of Hitzig, Kliefoth, or Keil most nearly expresses the conception of the Hebrew term. The altar was surrounded by an enclosure in which it seemed to be set, or out of which to rise; the dimensions of this "stand" or "enclosure" being a cubit in height, and a cubit in breadth, with <span class="cmt_word">a border</span> on its edge round about a span or half a cubit high. This, the stand just described, should be <span class="cmt_word">the higher place</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the back</span>; hence the support, base (Revised Version), or elevation, <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.) of the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
