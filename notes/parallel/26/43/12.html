This is fitly opened with a description of the altar for the sacrifices, the central act of the ancient worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the law of the house</span>. In this instance "the house" must not be restricted to the temple proper, consisting of the holy place and the holy of holies, but extended to the whole free space encompassing the outer court, the quadrangular area of three thousand cubits square (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-20</a>); and concerning this house as so defined, the fundamental torah, law, or regulation, is declared to be that of its complete sanctity. Ewald and Smend, as usual, unite with the LXX. in connecting "upon the top of the mountain" with "house;" but expositors generally agree that the clause belong to the words that follow, <span class="cmt_word">Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about;</span> and that the prophet's thought is that the entire territory upon the mountain summit included within the above specified border, and not merely the inner sanctuary, or even that with its chambers and courts, was to be regarded as most holy, or as a <span class="accented">holy of holies</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was to be consecrated as the innermost <span class="accented">adytum</span> of the tabernacle and temple had been. by the indwelling of Jehovah. Smend notes that "This is the law" is the customary underwriting and superscription of the laws of the priest-code (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-1.htm">Leviticus 7:1, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-46.htm">Leviticus 11:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-7.htm">Leviticus 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-59.htm">Leviticus 13:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-54.htm">Leviticus 14:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-32.htm">Leviticus 15:32</a>); but it need not result from this that the priest. code borrowed this expression from Ezekiel, who employs it only in this verse. The more rational hypothesis is that Ezekiel, himself a priest, made use of this formula, because acquainted with it as already existing in the so-called priest-code. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
