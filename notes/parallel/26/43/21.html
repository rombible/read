Here it is to be burned "in the appointed place of the house," and yet "without the sanctuary," or Temple building itself; it must, therefore, have been in the building described in 41:12<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - As a further stage in the ceremony, the Bullock of the sin offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the carcass of the victim, was to be burned by Ezekiel or the priest acting for him in <span class="cmt_word">the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary</span>, as in the Mosaic code it was prescribed that the flesh of the bullock, with his skin and dung, should be burned without the camp (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-11.htm">Leviticus 9:11, 15</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>). Ewald at first sought the place here referred to in the sacrificial kitchens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>), which it could not be, as these belonged to the "sanctuary" in the strictest sense; he has, however, since adopted the view of Kliefoth, which is doubtless correct, that the "place of the house, without the sanctuary" meant the <span class="accented">gizrah</span>, or separate place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>), which was a part of the "house" in the widest sense, and yet belonged not to the "sanctuary" in the strictest sense. Smend thinks of the <span class="accented">migrash</span>, "suburbs" or "open spaces," which surrounded the temple precincts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>); and these were certainly without the sanctuary, while they were also appointed for the holy place, and might have been designated, as here, <span class="accented">miphkadh</span>, as being always under the inspection of the temple watchmen. The fact that in post-exilic times one of the city gates was called <span class="accented">Hammiphkadh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-31.htm">Nehemiah 3:31</a>) lends countenance to this view. That in this "appointed place" the carcass of the bullock should be consumed was a deviation from the Mosaic ritual, which prescribed that the fat portions should be burned upon the altar, and the rest eaten as a sacrificial meal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-10.htm">Leviticus 4:10, 26, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>, 81; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7, 17, 18</a>). Keil appears to think that the fat portions may have been burned upon the altar, although it is not so mentioned, and that only "those points" were mentioned "in which deviations from the ordinary ritual took place." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.</body></html>
