The nearness here spoken of is to be understood not locally, but spiritually, of sympathy in idolatry. Of the earlier connection between Israel and Assyria there is little remaining record. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19-20</a>, it is said that Pul exacted tribute of Menahem, and the mention seems to imply a still earlier intercourse. According to the Assyrian records, Jehu was tributary to Shalmaneser; Assyria, as representing the great northern power, in contrast to Egypt on the south, is probably used here in a sense broad enough to include also Syria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The history of both the sisters passes from the time of the Exodus to that of their separate existence, and starts, in fact, from their first intercourse with the great monarchies of Asia. So far it is less a survey of their successive stages of degradation, like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, than a retrospect of their political alliances. <span class="cmt_word">Aholah played the harlot</span>. The lovers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-33.htm">Ezekiel 16:33</a>, are the nations with which the kings of Israel were in alliance, and of these the Assyrians are named as pre-eminent. The word <span class="cmt_word">neighbors</span>, which in its literal sense is hardly applicable, is probably to be taken of spiritual affinity, or may be taken as "come near" is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-16.htm">Leviticus 20:16</a>. The Assyrians were those who, in that sense, came near to the harlot city. We have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a> the fact that Menahem paid tribute to Pul. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a> and Hosea 7:11 speak generally of such alliances. The black obelisk of Shalmaneser records the fact that Jehu paid tribute to him ('Records of the Past,' 5:41). In the last-named case the tribute consisted chiefly of vessels of gold, bowls, goblets, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-49 A history of the apostacy of God's people from him, and the aggravation thereof. - In this parable, Samaria and Israel bear the name Aholah, her own tabernacle; because the places of worship those kingdoms had, were of their own devising. Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, my tabernacle is in her, because their temple was the place which God himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy conversation and godliness?</body></html>
