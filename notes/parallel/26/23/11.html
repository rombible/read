The idolatries of Judah not only comparatively but actually exceeded those of her sister kingdom.

In addition to her connection with Assyria, Judah also formed alliances with Chaldaea, and intrigued with Egypt and other nations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - The issue of the Assyrian alliance in the fall of Samaria might have served as a warning to the kings of Judah.

Hezekiah followed in the same line, though he too trusted in Egypt, and afterwards rebelled. Manasseh too paid tribute, and made Jerusalem the scene of a confluent idolatry, which included that of Assyria. Even Josiah went forth against Pharaoh-Necho as the faithful vassal of either Assyria or Babylon. The splendor which had fascinated Samaria fascinated her also. Here <span class="cmt_word">clothed most gorgeously</span> takes the place of "clothed in blue" in Ver. 6, describing, probably, the same fact. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-49 A history of the apostacy of God's people from him, and the aggravation thereof. - In this parable, Samaria and Israel bear the name Aholah, her own tabernacle; because the places of worship those kingdoms had, were of their own devising. Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, my tabernacle is in her, because their temple was the place which God himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy conversation and godliness?</body></html>
