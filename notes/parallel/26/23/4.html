while the southern kingdom, represented by Jerusalem, is called Aholibah = <span class= "ital">my tabernacle is in her, </span>because she still contained the sanctuary of the Lord. The word "elder" should be translated <span class= "ital">greater, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-46.htm" title="And your elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at your left hand: and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.">Ezekiel 16:46</a>. (See Note there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The occurrence of proper names is almost unique in the parables of the Bible, the Lazarus of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a> being the only other instance. Their meaning is sufficiently clear. <span class="cmt_word">Aholah</span> (but both names should begin with O rather than A) means "Her tent;" <span class="cmt_word">Aholibah</span>, "My tent is in her." A parallel, which may have suggested the names, is found in the <span class="accented">Aholibamah</span> (equivalent to "My tent is in the high place") of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a>, and another in the use of <span class="accented">Ohel</span> as a proper name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-20.htm">1 Chronicles 3:20</a>. The common element of the two names is the word that is commonly used for the sacred tent or tabernacle in the Pentateuch and elsewhere. The distinctive element of each points to the fact that the worship in Samaria was unauthorized. Her "tent" was hers, not Jehovah's. Of Jerusalem with its temple Jehovah could say, "My tent is in her," and this, as magnifying her privilege, also aggravated her guilt. Keil and others take the adjective here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, as meaning "greater" rather than "older." The former adjective is, of course, applicable to the greater power of the kingdom of the Ten Tribes, and, even if we retain the renderings of the Authorized Version, is probably the explanation of Samaria being named as the <span class="cmt_word">elder</span> of the two. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-49 A history of the apostacy of God's people from him, and the aggravation thereof. - In this parable, Samaria and Israel bear the name Aholah, her own tabernacle; because the places of worship those kingdoms had, were of their own devising. Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, my tabernacle is in her, because their temple was the place which God himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy conversation and godliness?</body></html>
