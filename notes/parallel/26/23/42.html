The phrase translated "with her" is rendered "thereby" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-14.htm" title="And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: let the same be she that you have appointed for your servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that you have showed kindness to my master.">Genesis 24:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Men of the common sort </span>is better rendered in the margin, <span class= "ital">the multitude of men; </span>and "Sabeans" is not a proper name, but, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">drunkards. </span>They are represented as from the wilderness, not as their home, but as the region through which they passed in marching to Judaea. The whole sense of the verse is that the conquerors attacking the land were satisfied with heavy tribute, and having received this, many of the warriors gave themselves up to drunkenness and debauchery, decking out their tributary with meretricious ornaments.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A voice of a multitude</span>, etc. The word for "multitude" is strictly tumult, and Keil and Currey render, The voice of tumult became still," <span class="accented">sc</span>. the threats of the alien powers whom Judah courted were for a time hushed by the tributes thus paid to them. <span class="cmt_word">With the men of the common sort</span>; literally, as in the margin, of <span class="accented">the multitude of men</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Sabeans from the wilderness</span>.

"Sabeans" rests on a Jewish rendering of the text, but, as a people, the Sabeans, who dwelt south of Meroe, though named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, were too remote to come within the horizon of the parable. What Ezekiel dwells on is the ever-growing degradation of the harlot city. Not only the officers of the Chaldeans, but the mixed multitude, the very drunkards from the wilderness of Babylon, were admitted to her embraces. Possibly the word may point to the false gods to whom libations of wine were offered, but I incline to refer it rather to those who got drunk at their idol-festivals even in Jerusalem. Drunkenness was one of the vices of the Babylonians, and the prophets, who admired the Rechabites and the Nazarites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-11.htm">Amos 2:11</a>), must have looked on Judah's participation in that sin as a measureless degradation. <span class="cmt_word">The bracelets and crowns</span> symbolize the wealth and prestige which the Chaldean alliance was supposed to bring with it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-49 A history of the apostacy of God's people from him, and the aggravation thereof. - In this parable, Samaria and Israel bear the name Aholah, her own tabernacle; because the places of worship those kingdoms had, were of their own devising. Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, my tabernacle is in her, because their temple was the place which God himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy conversation and godliness?</body></html>
