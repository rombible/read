But all question whether Ezekiel here looks forward to that calamity, and all comparison between that and the destruction under Nebuchadnezzar, are out of place. What the prophet here intends is not a comparison between different judgments upon the Jews, but between God's treatment of them and of others. As they had received at His hand higher opportunities and privileges than He had before given or would afterwards give to any other nation, so must the punishment for their sin be more severe and more conspicuous than He had inflicted or would inflict on any other. All the Divine judgments upon them through all time may therefore be considered as here coming into view. The present captivity and the impending destruction of the temple were but single features of a long series of judgments, in the course of which the terrible particulars mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm" title="Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the middle of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.">Ezekiel 5:10</a> should have place, ending with what is the present condition of the people before our eyes, scattered "into all the winds." Such evils had been foretold by their prophets all through their history as the consequence of disobedience (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-29.htm" title="And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.">Leviticus 26:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-53.htm" title="And you shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the narrow place, with which your enemies shall distress you:">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>--the sons eating their fathers is a fearful addition here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-9.htm" title="And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and narrow place, with which their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.">Jeremiah 19:9</a>), and from time to time had in some degree come to pass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/6-28.htm" title="And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.">2Kings 6:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-20.htm" title="Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom you have done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?">Lamentations 2:20</a>), although the culmination of the punishment, like the culmination of the sin, was still future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will do in thee,</span> etc. The like words were spoken by our Lord of the destruction of the city that was then future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>); but the war, Is of Ezekiel manifestly refer to that which was within the horizon of his vision, and find their parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-12.htm">Daniel 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-17 The sentence passed upon Jerusalem is very dreadful, the manner of expression makes it still more so. Who is able to stand in God's sight when he is angry? Those who live and die impenitent, will perish for ever unpitied; there is a day coming when the Lord will not spare. Let not persons or churches, who change the Lord's statutes, expect to escape the doom of Jerusalem. Let us endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. Sooner or later God's word will prove itself true.</body></html>
