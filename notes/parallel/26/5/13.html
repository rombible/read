<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-13.htm" title="Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted his people, and will have mercy on his afflicted.">Isaiah 49:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm" title="For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.">Isaiah 51:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm" title="I, even I, am he that comforts you: who are you, that you should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;">Isaiah 51:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-9.htm" title="Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.">Isaiah 52:9</a>, &c.; or of consoling oneself by taking vengeance, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-42.htm" title="And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau, as touching you, does comfort himself, purposing to kill you.">Genesis 27:42</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm" title="Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:">Isaiah 1:24</a> (Authorised Version, <span class= "ital">ease myself</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>(Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm" title="I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.">Ezekiel 31:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-31.htm" title="Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 32:31</a>.) The latter is evidently the meaning here; the Divine honour, wounded by the sins of the chosen people and dishonoured before the heathen, should be vindicated by their punishment in the sight of all the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">cause my fury to rest upon them,</span> etc.; Revised Version, <span class="accented">I will satisfy</span>, etc. The phrase meets us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-42.htm">Ezekiel 16:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-17.htm">Ezekiel 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-13.htm">Ezekiel 24:13</a>. To "rest" here is to "repose" rather than to "abide." The thought is that a righteous anger, like that of Jehovah, rests (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> is quieted) when it has done its work, and that in this sense God is "comforted," either as rejoicing in the punishment of evil for its own sake (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>), or because the punishment does its work in leading men to repentance. Israel may be comforted, because God is comforted as he sees that his judgments have done their work, and that his wrath can find repose. <span class="cmt_word">Have spoken in my zeal</span>. The thought implied is that what is spoken in the earnest purpose of "zeal" will assuredly be carried into execution (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-32.htm">Isaiah 37:32</a>). Men might deride the prophet's warning as an idle threat. It would prove itself to have come from God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-17 The sentence passed upon Jerusalem is very dreadful, the manner of expression makes it still more so. Who is able to stand in God's sight when he is angry? Those who live and die impenitent, will perish for ever unpitied; there is a day coming when the Lord will not spare. Let not persons or churches, who change the Lord's statutes, expect to escape the doom of Jerusalem. Let us endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. Sooner or later God's word will prove itself true.</body></html>
