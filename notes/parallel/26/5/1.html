The English version also neglects to notice the pronoun in the second clause. The thought is plainly that the prophet is to take a sword, on account of its symbolism, and use it instead of a razor.<p><span class= "bld">Upon thine head, and upon thy beard.</span>--The cutting off the hair was a common mark of mourning (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm" title="Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped,">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm" title="And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:">Isaiah 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm" title="Cut off your hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.">Jeremiah 7:29</a>); but the allusion here seems to be rather to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm" title="In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.">Isaiah 7:20</a>, in which God describes his coming judgments upon Israel as a shaving, "with a razor that is hired . . . by the king of Assyria," of the head and the beard. The symbolism was the more marked because Ezekiel was a priest, and the priests were expressly forbidden in the law to shave either the head or the beard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm" title="They shall not make baldness on their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.">Leviticus 21:5</a>). The shaving, therefore, of a priest's head and beard with a sword betokened a most desolating judgment.<p><span class= "bld">Then take thee balances to weigh</span> is not a mere detail introduced to give vividness to the symbolism, but seems designed to show the absolute certainty of the impending judgment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thee a barber's razor,</span> etc. The series of symbolic acts is carried further. Recollections of Isaiah and Leviticus mingle strangely in the prophet's mind. The former had made the "razor" the symbol of the devastation wrought by an invading army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>). The latter had forbidden its use for the head and beard of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>). Once again Ezekiel is commanded to do a forbidden thing as a symbolic act. He is, for the moment, the representative of the people of Jerusalem, and there is to be, as of old, a great destruction of that people as "by a razor that is hired." The word for "barber" (perhaps "hair cutter") does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament, but its use may be noted as showing that then, as now, the "barber" was a recognized institution in every Eastern town. The word for "knife" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>) is used in ver. 2, and commonly throughout the Old Testament, for "sword," and is so translated here by the LXX. and Vulgate. The prophet is to take a "sword" and use it as a razor, to make the symbolism more effective. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The prophet must shave off the hair of his head and beard, which signifies God's utter rejecting and abandoning that people. One part must be burned in the midst of the city, denoting the multitudes that should perish by famine and pestilence. Another part was to be cut in pieces, representing the many who were slain by the sword. Another part was to be scattered in the wind, denoting the carrying away of some into the land of the conqueror, and the flight of others into the neighbouring countries for shelter. A small quantity of the third portion was to be bound in his shirts, as that of which he is very careful. But few were reserved. To whatever refuge sinners flee, the fire and sword of God's wrath will consume them.</body></html>
