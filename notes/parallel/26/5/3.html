(See Jeremiah 40, 41) The ultimate result was the expatriation of all that remained in Judaea, and the entire emptying of the land of the chosen people.<p><span class= "ital">At this </span>point the use of symbolism ceases for a while, and the prophet now, for the first time, begins to utter his prophecies in plain language. Accordingly, he changes his style from prose to the more ordinary form of prophetic utterance in parallelisms, which constitute the distinctive feature of Hebrew poetry, and this continues until another vision begins with Ezekiel 8.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt also take,</span> etc. The words may point <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either to those in Jerusalem who had escaped the famine and the sword, and were left in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-6.htm">Jeremiah 40:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-6.htm">Jeremiah 40:6</a>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to those who should go into exile, and yet even there suffer from the "fire" of God's chastening judgments. They were, if saved at all, to be saved "so as by fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-15.htm">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>), to be as "brands plucked from the burning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>).

The whole utterance is one of denunciation. The act of "binding in the skirts" implies only a limited protection. Omit "for," and for "thereof" read "therefrom," <span class="accented">s.c.</span> from the fire (Revised Version). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The prophet must shave off the hair of his head and beard, which signifies God's utter rejecting and abandoning that people. One part must be burned in the midst of the city, denoting the multitudes that should perish by famine and pestilence. Another part was to be cut in pieces, representing the many who were slain by the sword. Another part was to be scattered in the wind, denoting the carrying away of some into the land of the conqueror, and the flight of others into the neighbouring countries for shelter. A small quantity of the third portion was to be bound in his shirts, as that of which he is very careful. But few were reserved. To whatever refuge sinners flee, the fire and sword of God's wrath will consume them.</body></html>
