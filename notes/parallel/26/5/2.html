The meaning of this verse is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm" title="A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.">Ezekiel 5:12</a>, and is made plainer by translating the same word uniformly "sword," instead of changing to "knife." The third, which is scattered, plainly signifies the small part of the people who, escaping destruction, shall be scattered among the heathen. A similar prophecy, referring however to a later time, may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/13-8.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, said the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.">Zechariah 13:8-9</a>. The expression, "when the days of the siege are fulfilled," of course refers to the symbolic siege of the prophet. The words, "I will draw out a sword after them," are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm" title="And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.">Leviticus 26:33</a>, and are repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm" title="A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.">Ezekiel 5:12</a>, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm" title="And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.">Ezekiel 12:14</a>. The suffering from the Divine judgments should still follow them in their exile. Plain prophecy is here mixed with the symbolism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt burn with fire,</span> etc. The symbolism receives its interpretation in ver. 12. A third part of the people (we need not expect numerical exactness) was to perish in the city of pestilence and famine, another to fall by the sword in their attempts to escape, yet another third was to be scattered to the far off land of their exile, and even there the sword was to follow them. The words, <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the city,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">the days of the siege</span>, find their most natural explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1, 5, 6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The prophet must shave off the hair of his head and beard, which signifies God's utter rejecting and abandoning that people. One part must be burned in the midst of the city, denoting the multitudes that should perish by famine and pestilence. Another part was to be cut in pieces, representing the many who were slain by the sword. Another part was to be scattered in the wind, denoting the carrying away of some into the land of the conqueror, and the flight of others into the neighbouring countries for shelter. A small quantity of the third portion was to be bound in his shirts, as that of which he is very careful. But few were reserved. To whatever refuge sinners flee, the fire and sword of God's wrath will consume them.</body></html>
