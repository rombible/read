It would be an exaggeration to say that the Israelites were actually more evil in their life than the surrounding heathen; for they were, no doubt, far better. Even of those cities which our Lord, at a later day, so strongly upbraided, it would be absurd to suppose that they equalled Sodom and Gomorrah in their iniquity. God's judgments are always relative and proportioned to the opportunities He has granted to men. The point is that the Israelites had <span class= "ital">resisted His judgments </span>more than the heathen; they had sinned against greater light. The pronoun <span class= "ital">they </span>in the last clause refers, of course, to the Israelites, not to the heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She hath changed,</span> etc. To that calling Jerusalem had been unfaithful. <span class="accented">Corruptio optimi pessima</span>, and she had sunk to a lower level than the <span class="cmt_word">nations round about her</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For changed my judgments into wickedness,</span> read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">hath rebelled against my judgments in doing wickedness.</span> The pronoun refers, not to the nations, but to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and so in the next clause. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-17 The sentence passed upon Jerusalem is very dreadful, the manner of expression makes it still more so. Who is able to stand in God's sight when he is angry? Those who live and die impenitent, will perish for ever unpitied; there is a day coming when the Lord will not spare. Let not persons or churches, who change the Lord's statutes, expect to escape the doom of Jerusalem. Let us endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. Sooner or later God's word will prove itself true.</body></html>
