The word properly means to <span class= "ital">withdraw, </span>and is to be taken either as reflective, "withdraw myself," or as having for its object "mine eye" of the following clause, the sense being the same in either case: the Lord will withdraw from them His presence and His compassion.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/5-12.htm" title="A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.">Ezekiel 5:12-17</a> follow in plain language the symbolical prophecies of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/5-1.htm" title="And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber's razor, and cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.">Ezekiel 5:1-4</a>, and give the inspired interpretation of their meaning. They bring out very distinctly the fact that the judgments should not end with the destruction of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast defiled my sanctuary,</span> etc. For the full account of the nature of the abominations which are thus spoken of, see notes on ch. 8. This was, after all, the root evil of all other evils. Pollution of worship, the degradation of the highest element in man's nature, passed into pollution and degradation of his whole life. Even in our Lord's acted teaching, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15, 16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>, we have the same principle implied. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I also diminish thee,</span> etc. The italics show that the last word is not in the Hebrew. The Revised Version margin suggests two other renderings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Therefore will I also withdraw mine eye that it shall not spare</span>; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Therefore will I hew thee down.</span> To these we may add the LXX. <span class="accented">I will reject</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">I will break in pieces</span>, which apparently, like (2), imply a different reading. Most recent critics suggest conjectural emendations of the text. I incline to rest satisfied with the Authorized Version, and to explain it by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>. The word implies not only the decrease, but the entire withdrawal of Jehovah's favour. Possibly there is an implied reference to the command of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a>. Jerusalem had "diminished" from the Law of God, had, as it were, erased the commandments which were of supreme obligation, and therefore, as by a <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>, God would diminish her. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have any pity</span>. The words are, of course, anthropomorphic, and have therefore to be received with the necessary limitations. As the earthly minister of justice must not yield to a weak pity which would be incompatible with the assertion of the eternal law of righteousness, so neither will the Supreme Judge. There is a time for all things, and justice must do its work first, in order that there may be room for pity afterwards. For other assertions, which seems strange to us, of trials unpitying character of God, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-18.htm">Ezekiel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-10.htm">Ezekiel 9:10</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-14.htm">Jeremiah 13:14</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-17 The sentence passed upon Jerusalem is very dreadful, the manner of expression makes it still more so. Who is able to stand in God's sight when he is angry? Those who live and die impenitent, will perish for ever unpitied; there is a day coming when the Lord will not spare. Let not persons or churches, who change the Lord's statutes, expect to escape the doom of Jerusalem. Let us endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. Sooner or later God's word will prove itself true.</body></html>
