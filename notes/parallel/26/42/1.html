Those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a> were in the inner, while these were in the outer; and if the cells spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a> were in the outer court, they were also on the pavement by the outer wall, while the chambers now alluded to were "over against," or <span class="accented">in front of</span>, the gizrah, or separate place (see on Ezekiel 41:12), and "over against," or in <span class="accented">front of</span>, "the building toward the north." This building Kiel, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre hold to have been the erection on the gizrah; Ewald, Kliefoth, Smend, and Currey believe it to have meant the temple. The question as to which view is correct is immaterial, since the row of chambers extended in front of parts of both buildings. Ewald, as usual, follows the LXX., and translates, "brought me to the fifteen (another Greek text has five) cells;" but of this the Hebrew contains nothing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-20 In this chapter are described the priests' chambers, their use, and the dimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood. These chambers were many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in his house on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in his sanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, were near the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must prepare for public devotions, and further us in improving them, as our opportunities are.</body></html>
