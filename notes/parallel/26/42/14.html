this is not expressly stated in general terms, but it is said that they were to wear them when engaged in such duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm" title="And they shall be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they come in to the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever to him and his seed after him.">Exodus 28:43</a>), and in some particular cases that they were to put them off when they went out of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/6-10.htm" title="And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.">Leviticus 6:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm" title="And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:">Leviticus 16:23</a>). It seems probable, therefore, that Ezekiel here recognises the ancient custom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-20 In this chapter are described the priests' chambers, their use, and the dimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood. These chambers were many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in his house on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in his sanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, were near the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must prepare for public devotions, and further us in improving them, as our opportunities are.</body></html>
