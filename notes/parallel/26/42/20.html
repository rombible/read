but the same word is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm" title="And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.">Ezekiel 40:5</a>, of the massive wall surrounding the outer court. The object of this enclosure was to protect the sanctity of the Temple and its courts, "to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane.</span> In these words the prophet indicates the purpose designed to be served by this particular wall; and although it may be said the outer court divided between the "sanctuary," or <span class="accented">that which was holy</span>, and the "profane," <span class="accented">or that which was common</span>, yet a more decided separation would assuredly be made by extending in the way described the precincts of the house. The objections usually offered to the view which regards the present measurements as those of a larger quadrangle encompassing the outer court, are not sufficient to make that view impossible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is said that the "sanctuary" always refers to the house as contrasted with its courts, especially with the outer court, and that in this sense it should here be taken; but the rendering, "that which is holy," shows how the idea of special sanctity might easily be extended to the whole structure, including courts as well as house (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-2.htm">Psalm 114:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is urged that there is no other instance in which the measurements are represented as having been taken by "reeds" in the plural; but a glance at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>, etc., and Ezekiel 48:16, will show that this is incorrect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is represented that in the center of such a huge quadrangle the house, with its courts and gates, would wear an insignificant appearance; but, while this might have been so had the area been crowded with other buildings, it is rather likely that in the midst of so large a vacant space the temple and its courts stand out with increased clearness, if not with augmented size. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is added that the summit of Mount Moriah could not admit of the construction of such a vast quadrangle; and it is answered that this shows the temple was an ideal house, never meant to be built upon the literal Moriah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-20 In this chapter are described the priests' chambers, their use, and the dimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood. These chambers were many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in his house on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in his sanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, were near the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must prepare for public devotions, and further us in improving them, as our opportunities are.</body></html>
