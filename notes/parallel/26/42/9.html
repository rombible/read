Translate: <span class= "ital">And from underneath it</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the wall just spoken of) <span class= "ital">these chambers.</span> The wall screened the lower part of the chambers so that to one looking from the east they appeared to rise out of it. Then a new clause begins: "The entrance was from the east, as one goeth to them from the outer court." It is perfectly clear that this does not refer to any entrance from the inner court, because it expressly says "as one goeth from the outer court." The object of the statement is probably to show that the access to the chambers was from the outer court by means of the walk already described, leading from the east, from the porch of the gate to the inner court.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/42-10.htm" title="The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.">Ezekiel 42:10-12</a> describe briefly another chamber-building at the south of the "separate place," exactly like the one already described at the north. There is only need to notice some required changes in the translation. Thus read <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-10.htm" title="The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.">Ezekiel 42:10</a>, <span class= "ital">On the breadth of the wall of the court going toward the east, over against the separate place and over against the building were the chambers.</span> The <span class= "ital">wall</span> is here the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm" title="And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.">Ezekiel 42:7</a>, and means therefore not the wall of a building, but a fence-wall; it is here defined, however, as "the wall of the court," and must be understood of the division wall between the inner and outer courts. Along this, as it stretched to the east, the building was situated. Some writers, by a slight alteration of the text, would change <span class= "ital">east</span> into <span class= "ital">south,</span> so that for "going toward the east" we should read <span class= "ital">on the south.</span> This makes the sense clearer, but is not necessary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The chambers were approached by an entry (in the text <span class="cmt_word">the entry</span>, this being a well-known and recognized part of the structure) which ran along the east side of the building, and led from the outer to the temple court. As this (the outer) court was higher than that (the temple), and could only be reached by steps, "the entry" is represented as lying under the chambers. It was manifestly this "entry" that was screened by the fence mentioned in ver. 7. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-20 In this chapter are described the priests' chambers, their use, and the dimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood. These chambers were many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in his house on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in his sanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, were near the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must prepare for public devotions, and further us in improving them, as our opportunities are.</body></html>
