Those purposes, again, are defined as two.

Under the Law these were appointed to be eaten in the holy place beside the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-10.htm">Numbers 18:10</a>); in Ezekiel's temple, a special quarter in the near vicinity of the house should be reserved for this purpose. There those portions of the sacrifices that could be eaten were to be consumed; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the flesh of the sin and trespass offerings, and the meal of the meat offering; but as these could not be at once used, they were to be deposited there until they were prepared for eating, the flesh by being boiled and the meal by being mixed with oil. The obvious intention of this was to convey an idea of the special sanctity of the worship in which the priests were engaged; and just for this reason also they were required to array themselves in <span class="cmt_word">other garments</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>) when they entered on their priestly functions. The putting on and off of these holy clothes took place in the chambers now referred to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-20 In this chapter are described the priests' chambers, their use, and the dimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood. These chambers were many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in his house on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in his sanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, were near the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must prepare for public devotions, and further us in improving them, as our opportunities are.</body></html>
