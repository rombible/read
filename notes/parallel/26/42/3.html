The meaning seems to be that in each chamber building, on the north and on the south, there was a gallery in the third storey, so placed on the south side of the north building and the north side of the south building that they faced each other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Considerable difficulty attaches to the words of this verse. <span class="cmt_word">The twenty cubits which were for the inner court</span> (better, <span class="accented">the twenty which belonged to the inner court</span>) have been taken by Kliefoth to signify the watchers' coils in the inner court, west of the north door (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-40.htm">Ezekiel 40:40-46</a>), and by Plumptre to indicate an inner area of twenty cubits square, round which the galleries in three stories ran. Both of these views, however, have this against them, that they are purely conjectural, the text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-40.htm">Ezekiel 40:40-46</a> saying nothing about twenty cubits in connection with the priests' chambers, and the text under review making no suggestion of an inner area of twenty cubits, but only of the already well-known "inner court." Hence the opinion of Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Schroder, and Currey has most in its favor, that the "twenty" alongside of which the chamber now alluded to lay, meant the twenty cubits clear space which surrounded the temple on the south, west, and north sides (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12-14</a>), and which could properly be spoken of as "for the inner court," rather as "belonging to the inner court," since it was practically a continuation of the same. <span class="cmt_word">The pavement which was for</span> (or, <span class="accented">belonged to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the outer court</span>, was manifestly that already described as running along the inside of the outer wall (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>). If, as is likely, this pavement was continued along the north side of the inner court wall, then the priests' chambers must have stood upon it, and been over against it on the east side, as Currey explains; but the easier and more natural supposition is that adopted by Keil, that the second "over against" points to that which faced the chambers on the north, viz. the pavement, as the first marked their boundary on the south. <span class="cmt_word">Gallery against gallery</span> (see on Ezekiel 41:15). In three stories; or, in the third story (Revised Version). Whether these galleries existed in each of three stories of the building, or only in the third, cannot be determined.

These chambers were many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in his house on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in his sanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, were near the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must prepare for public devotions, and further us in improving them, as our opportunities are.</body></html>
