Its length is also said to be fifty cubits (the breadth of the chamber). It must, therefore, have been a screen wall at one end of the chambers, and it could not have been at the western end, as that was otherwise occupied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/46-19.htm" title="After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.">Ezekiel 46:19-20</a>). It was then at the eastern end, and was doubtless for the purpose of screening the windows at that end from the outer court while the priests were changing their garments. The word here translated <span class= "ital">over against</span> is not the one used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm" title="Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.">Ezekiel 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm" title="Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.">Ezekiel 42:3</a>, and may equally well be rendered <span class= "ital">parallel to.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wall</span>; or, <span class="accented">fence</span> - the Hebrew term being not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a>, both of which signify the wall of a city or a building, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, as in ver. 10), which means a fence or hedge, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a> - <span class="cmt_word">without, over against</span> - or, <span class="accented">by the side of</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">the chambers, toward the outer court</span>, cannot have been a rampart along the north side of-the chambers, since this was a hundred cubits long, but must have been a wall upon the side of the chambers (east or west) fencing off the outer court from the passage which led down by the side of the chambers. That this fence was on the east side is rendered probable by the circumstance that the sacrificial kitchen lay upon the west (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19, 20</a>), and by the statements which follow in vers. 8 and 9. The fence was doubtless intended to screen the side windows of the lower chambers from public gaze, since these were to be occupied as robing and disrobing rooms for the priests who should officiate in the temple (see ver. 14; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-20 In this chapter are described the priests' chambers, their use, and the dimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood. These chambers were many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in his house on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in his sanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, were near the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must prepare for public devotions, and further us in improving them, as our opportunities are.</body></html>
