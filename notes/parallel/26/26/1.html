It is plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-2.htm" title="Son of man, because that Tyrus has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned to me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:">Ezekiel 26:2</a> that Tyre already felt sure of the issue of the siege; but there is a marked difference between this and the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-3.htm" title="And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Because you said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;">Ezekiel 25:3</a>, which could only have been used after the capture of the city. This prophecy may therefore well have been given at any time during the eleventh year. Possibly the Alexandrine Septuagint is right in supplying "the first" month; but as this is omitted in the Roman copy, it is more likely to have been a mere conjecture. There is a similar omission in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-17.htm" title="It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 32:17</a>, but the number is easily supplied there from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 26:1</a>. Probably, in both cases the omission is a mere error of the scribes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the eleventh year</span>, etc. The last date given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a>) was the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year (<span class="accented">sc</span>. <span class="date">B.C. 590</span>). We have now come to the eleventh year, on which, on the ninth day of the fourth month, Jerusalem was taken, while its destruction followed in the seventh day of the fifth month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6, 12</a>). Here the number of the month is not given in the Hebrew or the Vulgate, while the LXX. inserts the "first month." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17</a> we have a like omission, and in both cases it is natural to assume an error of transcription. The tidings of the capture may have reached both Tyre and Tel-Abib, and Ezekiel may have heard of the temper in which the former had received them, just as he had heard how the nations named in the previous chapter had exulted in the fall, imminent and, as they thought, inevitable, of the holy city. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-14 To be secretly pleased with the death or decay of others, when we are likely to get by it; or with their fall, when we may thrive upon it, is a sin that easily besets us, yet is not thought so bad as really it is. But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.</body></html>
