He has in mind not merely the conquest by Nebuchadnezzar, of which he will speak more particularly presently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/26-7.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring on Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.">Ezekiel 26:7-11</a>), but all the successive conquests until the proud city should be reduced to utter desolation. Most appropriate to the situation and habits of Tyre is the illustration, "as the sea causeth his waves to come up": God will bring nation after nation to the destruction of Tyre as the sea throws wave after wave against her rock.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the sea causeth</span>, etc. We note the special appropriateness of the comparison to the position of the island city. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-14 To be secretly pleased with the death or decay of others, when we are likely to get by it; or with their fall, when we may thrive upon it, is a sin that easily besets us, yet is not thought so bad as really it is. But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.</body></html>
