Actual sovereigns are not meant, but those raised by commerce to wealth and power. Their astonishment and grief is poetically described under the figure of the customs of Oriental mourning. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm" title="For word came to the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.">Jonah 3:6</a>.) "Thrones" should rather be translated <span class= "ital">seats, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-20.htm" title="And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to you. And he arose out of his seat.">Judges 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm" title="So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat on a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.">1Samuel 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-13.htm" title="And when he came, see, Eli sat on a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.">1Samuel 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.">1Samuel 4:18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">sea</span> are not the kings of the isles, but the merchant-princes of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>). They shall lay aside their robes of state - Tyrian purple embroidered with gold and silver - and shall put on the garments of mourners. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a> presents an interesting parallel. The word <span class="cmt_word">thrones</span> is used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-13.htm">1 Samuel 4:13</a>, for any chair of state, as that of priest or judge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-14.htm">Proverbs 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1</a>), as well as for the specifically kingly throne. For the, most part, however, the later meaning is dominant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:15-21 See how high, how great Tyre had been. See how low Tyre is made. The fall of others should awaken us out of security. Every discovery of the fulfilment of a Scripture prophecy, is like a miracle to confirm our faith. All that is earthly is vanity and vexation. Those who now have the most established prosperity, will soon be out of sight and forgotten.</body></html>
