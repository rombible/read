The thought is that the rock of Tyre, built up with dwellings to the water's edge was like a city rising from the sea.<p><span class= "bld">Which cause their terror.</span>--This clause has occasioned much difficulty. The literal translation is, <span class= "ital">she and her inhabitants, which gave their fear to all her inhabitants. </span>"Fear" is here used in the sense of that which causes fear; and the meaning is, that the power of Tyre was so feared that every Tyrian was respected for her sake, just as at a later day every Roman bore about with him something of the majesty of Rome, or, as now, the citizen of a great Power is respected among foreigners for his country's sake. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm" title="There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.">Ezekiel 32:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-26.htm" title="There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.">Ezekiel 32:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Inhabited of seafaring</span>, etc.; Hebrew, from <span class="accented">the seas</span>. The sense is the same, but we lose the poetry of the original in the paraphrase. Possibly, however, the phrase may represent the position of Tyro as rising out of the sea or as deriving its wealth from it. Ewald adopts a conjectural reading, which gives "destroyed from the seas;" or, with another conjecture, "She that was settled from the days of the remote past." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:15-21 See how high, how great Tyre had been. See how low Tyre is made. The fall of others should awaken us out of security. Every discovery of the fulfilment of a Scripture prophecy, is like a miracle to confirm our faith. All that is earthly is vanity and vexation. Those who now have the most established prosperity, will soon be out of sight and forgotten.</body></html>
