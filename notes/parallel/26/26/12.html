It is no longer Nebuchadnezzar who does these things, but "they." This may intimate that the prophet's vision now again passes beyond the immediate future to the long succession of calamities, beginning indeed with Nebuchadnezzar's conquest, with which Tyre was to be visited. The "spoil" and "prey" is to be understood more of what the Tyrians lost than of what the conquerors gained. In the long-continued sieges to which the city was subjected there was great waste of its substance; but their command of the water generally enabled them before the close to send away their moveable wealth, so that the booty of the victor was small. (With the close of the verse comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-4.htm" title="And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.">Ezekiel 26:4</a>.) The situation of Tyre led naturally to her ruins being thrown into the sea.

But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.</body></html>
