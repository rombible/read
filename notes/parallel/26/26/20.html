it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.">Isaiah 14:9-20</a>. Tyre is here represented, as Babylon is there, as joining itself to the dead--a striking figure to indicate its utter and final destruction. This is to be understood of the Tyre that then was, the proud mistress of the sea. The question whether there might or might not ever be other inhabitants on the rock of Tyre is one which does not at all come within the scope of the prophet's vision. The way of speaking of the place of the dead, as in the lower part of the earth, so common in Scripture (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9</a>), does not by any means prove that the writers thought this to be the actual place of departed spirits, but only that, as it is a necessity of human thought and expression to indicate some locality, this locality, in association with the burial of the body, is most naturally placed "under the earth." In the same way, men, even on opposite sides of the globe, always speak of God as "above them," and their gestures and looks, as well as their words, unavoidably involve the same idea, though they perfectly know that He is omnipresent. (Comp. even the example of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-41.htm" title="And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.">Mark 6:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-34.htm" title="And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.">Mark 7:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-16.htm" title="Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.">Luke 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Set glory in the land of the living.</span>--The word for "glory" is the same as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm" title="In the day that I lifted up my hand to them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:">Ezekiel 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-15.htm" title="Yet also I lifted up my hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;">Ezekiel 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-9.htm" title="And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.">Daniel 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-16.htm" title="But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.">Daniel 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-41.htm" title="He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.">Daniel 11:41</a>, in connection with Palestine. The prediction is that when Tyre, who is now rejoicing in the calamity of Judah, shall be past and forgotten, numbered with the dead, then God will establish His people as a living Church to Himself. A ray of Messianic promise shines through the prediction, although, for the time, it might seem nothing more than a foretelling of the restoration from the Captivity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I shall bring thee down</span>, etc. The pit is <span class="accented">sheol</span>, Hades, the unseen world of the dead. The image may have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, where it is used of Babylon. It was obviously one on which the mind of Ezekiel dwelt, and is reproduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17-32</a>. Here, apparently, the sinking in the depth of the waters (Ver. 19) is thought of as leading to that world of the dead that lay beneath them. <span class="cmt_word">The people of old</span> <span class="cmt_word">time</span> may possibly include the races of the old world that were submerged in the waters of the Flood. The imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3-7</a> seems to have been floating before the prophet's mind. <span class="cmt_word">I shall set glory</span>; better, <span class="accented">will set</span>. The contrast drawn is that between the shadow-world of the dead, and the earth with its living inhabitants. There Jehovah would establish his glory, would, sooner or later, manifest his kingdom, while Tyre and its pomp should be no more, belonging only to the past. Conjectural readings and renderings have been suggested as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Hitzig, "And thou no longer shinest with glory in the <span class="accented">land of the living</span>." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Havernick and Kliefoth, "That I no longer produce anything glorious from thee in the land of the living." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ewald," That thou mayest not remain (or stand) in the laud of the living." I have adopted Keil's interpretation of the Anthorized Version. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:15-21 See how high, how great Tyre had been. See how low Tyre is made. The fall of others should awaken us out of security. Every discovery of the fulfilment of a Scripture prophecy, is like a miracle to confirm our faith. All that is earthly is vanity and vexation. Those who now have the most established prosperity, will soon be out of sight and forgotten.</body></html>
