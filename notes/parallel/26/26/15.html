The main reference here, no doubt, is to the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean; but as Tyrian commerce extended also beyond, the language need not be entirely restricted to these.

The Hebrew word is used in a wider sense, as including all settlements on the sea-coast as well as islands. So it is used of Philistia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>), and of the maritime states of Asia Minor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-18.htm">Daniel 11:18</a>), of the east and south coasts of Arabia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>). Looking to the extent of commerce described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, it probably includes all the Mediterranean settlements of the Tyrians, possibly also those in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. The report of the fall of Tyre was to spread far and wide. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:15-21 See how high, how great Tyre had been. See how low Tyre is made. The fall of others should awaken us out of security. Every discovery of the fulfilment of a Scripture prophecy, is like a miracle to confirm our faith. All that is earthly is vanity and vexation. Those who now have the most established prosperity, will soon be out of sight and forgotten.</body></html>
