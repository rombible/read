To "labour in vain" is the great misery of all workers for God. A time will come when he shall see that God has not sent him to such a work "in vain." What before was dark will be made clear unto him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>). Ezekiel's words, "not in vain," are echoed frequently by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14, 58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). The corresponding phrase, "I have broken their eyes," sounds strange to us; but, after all, the heart is not literally broken more than the eyes, and figuratively the same words may be applied to either, so that there is no need for supposing, with some critics, that a more appropriate verb has been dropped out. Eyes and heart were alike involved in the sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7, 8, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a>), and both came under the same chastisement that was to lead them to repentance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-10 A remnant of Israel should be left; at length they should remember the Lord, their obligations to him, and rebellion against him. True penitents see sin to be that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Those who truly loathe sin, loathe themselves because of sin. They give glory to God by their repentance. Whatever brings men to remember Him, and their sins against him, should be regarded as a blessing.</body></html>
