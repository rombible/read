Here, as constantly in all parts of Scripture, apostacy from God is described under the figure of unfaithfulness in the marriage relation. "They shall loathe themselves" indicates a true repentance; they shall loathe the sin and themselves for having committed it. Thus their sin has drawn down punishment; punishment has destroyed many, but brought a "remnant" to repentance; and repentance leads to a true knowledge of God, and communion with Him. The Divine word and act has not been "in vain."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because I am broken with their whorish heart.</span> The words have been very differently rendered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Revised Version mainly follows the Authorized Version, but gives, <span class="accented">they shall remember</span>... <span class="accented">how I have been broken</span>, etc. So taken, the words are boldly anthropomorphic, and ascribe to Jehovah the word which implies the strongest form of human distress. The "whorish heart" of the people has made Jehovah himself "broken-hearted." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Most recent critics, however, follow the rendering of the Vulgate (<span class="accented">contrivi</span>), and take the verb, which is passive in form, as being like a Greek verb in the middle voice, transitive in form, with an implied reflex force. So we get, as in the margin of the Revised Version, "I have broken their whorish heart." So taken, thought and words are both connected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>, and the self-loathing that follows has its counterpart in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>.

True penitents see sin to be that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Those who truly loathe sin, loathe themselves because of sin. They give glory to God by their repentance. Whatever brings men to remember Him, and their sins against him, should be regarded as a blessing.</body></html>
