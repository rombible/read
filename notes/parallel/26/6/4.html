In this and the following verse a kind of poetic justice is described. There was nothing so utterly defiling under the Mosaic law as the touch of a dead body. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/9-6.htm" title="And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:">Numbers 9:6-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-14.htm" title="And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.">2Kings 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-16.htm" title="And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them on the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.">2Kings 23:16</a>.) The Israelites had defiled the land with idols, now the idols themselves should be defiled with their dead bodies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your images,</span> etc. The "sun images" of the Revised Version shows why these are mentioned as distinct from the "idols." The <span class="accented">chammanim</span> were pillars or obelisks identified with the worship of Baal as the sun god, standing on his altars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4</a>), coupled with the "groves," or <span class="accented">Asherim</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-8.htm">Isaiah 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a>), and with the "high places" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I will cast down your slain men before your idols.</span> As in the prophecy against Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), and in Josiah's action (2 Kings 33:16), this was the <span class="accented">ne plus ultra</span> of desecration. Where throe had been the sweet savour of incense there should be the sickening odour of the carcases of the slain. The word for "idols" (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>), though found elsewhere, notably in Ezekiel's favourite textbooks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>), is more prominent in his writings (where it occurs thirty-six times) then in any other book of the Old Testament, and means, primarily, a cairn or heap of stones, which, like the "sun images," came to be associated with Baal. Ezekiel repeats both words in ver. 6, with all the emphasis of scorn. He predicts the coming of a time when the work of destruction should be done more thoroughly than even Josiah lind done it. When that time came, the familiar formula, "Ye shall know that I am the Lord," should receive yet another fulfilment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7. War desolates persons, places, and things esteemed most sacred. God ruins idolatries even by the hands of idolaters. It is just with God to make that a desolation, which we make an idol. The superstitions to which many trust for safety, often cause their ruin. And the day is at hand, when idols and idolatry will be as thoroughly destroyed from the professedly Christian church as they were from among the Jews.</body></html>
