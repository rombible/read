The "hills" and "mountains" were naturally the scenes of the worship of the "high places," and these were commonly associated with groves of trees, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>, oaks (or terebinths), poplars, and elms are specifically named (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-4.htm">2 Kings 16:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Where they did offer sweet savour,</span> etc. The phrase is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel as a priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-19.htm">Ezekiel 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28, 41</a>), and is specially prominent in the books which he must have studied. It meets us three times in Exodus, seventeen in Leviticus, seventeen in Numbers, and seldom elsewhere. The crowning sin, from the prophet's point of view, was that the incense which was due to Jehovah had been lavished on the false gods of the nations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-14 It is our duty to be affected, not only with our own sins and sufferings, but to look with compassion upon the miseries wicked people bring upon themselves. Sin is a desolating thing; therefore, stand in awe, and sin not. If we know the worth of souls, and the danger to which unbelievers are exposed, we shall deem every sinner who takes refuge in Jesus from the wrath to come, an abundant recompence for all contempt or opposition we may meet with.</body></html>
