It was customary to call any wilderness by the name of the nearest town. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/23-14.htm" title="And David stayed in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.">1Samuel 23:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/23-24.htm" title="And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.">1Samuel 23:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm" title="And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.">1Samuel 25:2</a>, &c.) That wilderness appears from this passage to have been proverbial for its desolation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">More desolate than the wilderness towards Diblath</span>; better, with the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">from the wilderness.</span> The name does not appear elsewhere, and has not been identified. Assuming the Authorized Version rendering, we must think of Ezekiel as naming, as Dante haines the Valdichiana ('Inf.,' 29:47), some specially horrible and desolate region. For such a region the name of Diblah (a cake of figs) does not seem appropriate. Taking the Revised Version translation ("from the wilderness toward Diblah"), we have a phrase analogous to "from Dan to Beersheba," as denoting the extent of the desolation. The "wilderness" is usually applied to the nomad region south of Palestine, and this would lead us to look for Diblah in the north, and so to look elsewhere than to the two places Beth-diblathaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>) and Almon-diblathaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>), both of which are in Moab. The difficulty was solved by Jerome by the conjectural emendation of Riblah, the two Hebrew letters for <span class="accented">d</span> and <span class="accented">r</span> being often written by copyists for each other. Riblah (it is a suggestive fact that the two chief manuscripts of the LXX. the Alexandrian and the Vatican, have <span class="accented">Deblatha</span>, or <span class="accented">Deblaa</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>) was a fortified town on the north road from Palestine to Babylon, where the Babylonian kings used to take up their position during their invasions of the former. Within a short time after Ezekiel wrote this chapter, it became memorable in its connection with Zedekiah's sufferings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6, 20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9, 10, 26</a>). Its probable site is fixed on the banks of the Orontes. The evidence, on the whole, is, I think, in favour of this interpretation. It is adopted by Ewald, Cornill, Smend, Gesenius, and most recent critics. An additional fact in its favour is that Hamath, in the same region, appears as an ideal northern boundary in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-14 It is our duty to be affected, not only with our own sins and sufferings, but to look with compassion upon the miseries wicked people bring upon themselves. Sin is a desolating thing; therefore, stand in awe, and sin not. If we know the worth of souls, and the danger to which unbelievers are exposed, we shall deem every sinner who takes refuge in Jesus from the wrath to come, an abundant recompence for all contempt or opposition we may meet with.</body></html>
