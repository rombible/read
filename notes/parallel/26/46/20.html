but as already remarked, these, with the walk that led to them, although within the enclosure of the outer, were considered as appurtenances of, and therefore belonging to, the inner court. The reason given for not bearing the flesh of the sin and trespass offering into the outer court is, lest they should thereby "sanctify the people," and the same reason is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-19.htm" title="And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.">Ezekiel 44:19</a> for not allowing the priests' garments to come into the outer court. Under the law all those offerings which it was the duty of the priests to consume are called "most holy," and whoever touched them or the sacred vessels of the sanctuary became "holy" in the sense of set apart to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm" title="All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that touches them shall be holy.">Leviticus 6:18</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm" title="Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.">Exodus 29:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm" title="And you shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever touches them shall be holy.">Exodus 30:29</a>). The object of the command is therefore to prevent that ceremonial sanctification of the people which would interfere with their ordinary life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The "place" was designed as a kitchen where the priests should boil the trespass and the sin offerings and bake the meat (or, meal) offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cook the portions of the sacrifices they should eat in their official capacity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>). The Law of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>) required the flesh to be boiled (and probably also the flour to be baked) at the tabernacle door. The last clause, <span class="cmt_word">that they</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the priests, <span class="cmt_word">bear</span> them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the offerings, <span class="cmt_word">not out into the utter</span> (or, outer) <span class="cmt_word">court, to sanctify the people</span>, is by most interpreters understood in the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a> (which see). To this, however, Kliefoth objects that the conception of deriving ceremonial sanctity from contact with such offerings is completely strange to the Old Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), and accordingly he connects the words. "to sanctify the people," with the "baking" and "boiling" of the preceding clause. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-24 The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are here described, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons and servants. Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.</body></html>
