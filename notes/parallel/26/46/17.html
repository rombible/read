Should the prince, however, bestow a portion of his inheritance on one of his servants, what was thus bestowed should not belong to that servant in perpetuity, but should be regarded simply as a temporary loan which should be his <span class="cmt_word">till the year of liberty</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the year of free flowing general - comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, pure myrrh (Authorized Version) or flowing myrrh (Revised Version) - hence the year <span class="accented">of release</span>; after which it should return to the prince. Smend thinks Ezekiel could hardly have had in view the year of jubilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-24.htm">Leviticus 27:24</a>), else he would not have employed the term "liberty," which Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8, 15, 17</a>) uses to denote the freedom regained by Hebrew bondmen in the seventh year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the seventh year was only a year of the release of bondmen, not of the reversion of property, and to this rather than to that Ezekiel refers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The year of jubilee might properly be called the "year of liberty," since in it both slaves were emancipated and property was liberated. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ezekiel's phraseology is not framed (nor is Jeremiah's) in imitation of either Exodus or Deuteronomy, the latter of which in particular speaks of "the year of release" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;&#x5e0;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), but adheres closely to the style of Leviticus, which, in fact, it presupposes. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> can only signify the year of <span class="accented">the release</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the well-known year of emancipation. The last clause should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, "As for his inheritance (generally), it shall be for his sons," or, as Keil translates, "Only his inheritance it is," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the prince's; "as for his sons, it shall be for them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-24 The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are here described, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons and servants. Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.</body></html>
