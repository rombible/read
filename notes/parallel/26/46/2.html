But he is not to enter the inner court, or to assume any priestly functions. Afterwards he is to go forth by the same way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-8.htm" title="And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.">Ezekiel 46:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-3.htm" title="It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.">Ezekiel 44:3</a>), and the gate stands open until evening, though no one else is to enter thereby.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The reason for the opening of this inner east gate should be that the prince might enter it as far as its threshold, and stand there worshipping by the posts of the gate, while his burnt offerings and his peace offerings were being prepared by the priests, who, rather than the prince, were the proper ministers for conducting the sacrificial ceremony. The prince should reach his station at the threshold of the inner gate, <span class="cmt_word">by the way of the porch of that</span> (or, the) <span class="cmt_word">gate without</span>; but whether this signified that he should pass through the eastern gate of the outer court, and so advance towards the inner east gate, as Ewald, Keil, Kliefoth, and Plumptre assume, or, as Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Smend suppose, that he should enter the inner gate by the way of the porch of the gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the outside, from the outer court into which he had previously entered through either the north or the south outer gates, cannot be decided. In favor of the former may be urged the consideration that it seems more natural to apply <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> to the outer gate than to the outer court, since no, one could enter the inner gate except from the outer court, unless he were already in the inner court; but in favor of the latter is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the stringent character of the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1-3</a>, which expressly declares that the outer east gate should not be opened, and that no man <span class="accented">should enter in by it</span>, thus scarcely admitting of an exception; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the statement in vers. 9, 10 of the present chapter, that in the "appointed feasts" the prince and the people alike should enter the outer court either by the north or the south gate, since, if any of these "feasts" fell upon a sabbath, this regulation would not be practicable, if the prince and the people were required to enter by different doors. The question, however, in itself is immaterial. The points of importance are that the prince should worship in the porch of the inner gate, and that, on finishing his worship, he should retire, and that the gate should not be shut; until the evening. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-24 The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are here described, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons and servants. Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.</body></html>
