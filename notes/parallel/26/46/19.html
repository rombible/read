Nothing is said of their size, and they may be assumed to have had the same dimensions (40 cubits by 30--<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-22.htm" title="In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.">Ezekiel 46:22</a>) as those of the people's kitchens. They are marked F on Plan II.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-24.</span> - The sacrificial kitchens for the priests and for the people. This passage has been transferred by Ewald to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42.htm">Ezekiel 42</a>, and inserted after ver. 14; but the Exposition will show it must have originally stood where it is. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After</span> (or, and) <span class="cmt_word">he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the measuring man, who had hitherto acted as the prophet's conductor - <span class="cmt_word">brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate.</span> This was the inner north gate, from which the prophet had been conducted to the front of the house in order to receive the sacrificial Torah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>), and to which, when this was finished, he had been seemingly led back. From this gate, then, he was taken by his guide along the entry or passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-9.htm">Ezekiel 42:9</a>), which ran towards and extended in front of <span class="cmt_word">the holy chambers of</span> (or, for) <span class="cmt_word">the priests, which looked toward the north</span>, and which had already been described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a>). Arrived at the western corner of the chambers, he perceived <span class="cmt_word">a place on the two sides</span> - or, on the <span class="accented">hinder part</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">westward</span>. The translation in the Authorized Version was obviously suggested by the dual form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, which properly signifies "on both sides" but when applied to the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-23.htm">Exodus 26:23</a>) or temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>), always describes the back part or rear. That a similar "place" existed on the south side is more than probable; though Smend thinks there was not a "place" on the south. The LXX. omits the words after "place," and supplies <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "separated." Keil finds in the description here given of the passage towards the holy chambers a proof that this section could not have steed originally after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>, as in that ease no such description would have been needed. Nor would the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, "and he brought me back," have been required or appropriate had the prophet not in the mean while changed his place, which he does to visit the holy chambers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-24 The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are here described, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons and servants. Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.</body></html>
