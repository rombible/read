The prince was required to provide and bring the sacrifices for himself and for the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm" title="And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 45:17</a>); therefore, as soon as the yearly festivals have been described, directions are given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/46-1.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.">Ezekiel 46:1-3</a>) for the conduct of the prince at these sacrifices. He was required to be always present, while attendance on the part of the people was obligatory only at the yearly festivals. The prophet then goes on to provide for the sacrifices for the Sabbaths and new moons, for free-will offerings, and for the daily sacrifices.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The gate of the inner court.--</span>It has already been provided (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/44-1.htm" title="Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looks toward the east; and it was shut.">Ezekiel 44:1-3</a>) that the outer gate on the east should be kept closed, except for the prince. The same thing is now commanded for the east gate of the inner court also; and, further, the days are specified, the Sabbaths and new moons, on which it shall be used by the prince.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-15.</span> - The supplementary directions contained in these verses relate to the worship of the prince and the people on the sabbaths and the new moons (vers. 1-7) and at the appointed feasts generally (vers. 5-15). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Like the preceding sections which introduced distinctly new enactments in Ezekiel's Torah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-9.htm">Ezekiel 44:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-9.htm">Ezekiel 45:9, 18</a>), this properly opens with a <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God</span>, since it refers to the worship that should be celebrated <span class="cmt_word">at the gate of the inner court which looketh toward the east.</span> Ewald, after the LXX.

It is, however, the inner east gate to which the present clause alludes, and the announce-meat made concerning it is that, like the outer east gate, it should be <span class="cmt_word">shut on the six working days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the six days of the business</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-19.htm">1 Samuel 20:19</a>); but that, unlike the outer east gate, it should be <span class="cmt_word">opened on the sabbath</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in the day of the sabbath</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and in the day of the new moon</span>, both of which clays had been marked under the Law, and should in future continue to be marked, by special sacrificial celebrations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-24 The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are here described, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons and servants. Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.</body></html>
