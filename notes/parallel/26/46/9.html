In order to prevent confusion, and that all might be conducted with propriety (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>), no one should depart by the gate through which he had entered, but by the opposite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he who had entered by the north gate should retire through the south gate, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>. Hengstenberg thinks the reason for this regulation "cannot be sought in the endeavor to avoid a throng," since "in that case it must have been ordained that all should go in by the same gate and go out by the opposite one;" it must, he holds, have been "a theological one," viz. "to signify that each should go out of the sanctuary another man than he came in." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-24 The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are here described, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons and servants. Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.</body></html>
