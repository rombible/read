It is not without significance that now the same person is made the agent of judgment. As God's love is turned to wrath by man's impenitence, and as His blessings given to man become curses by their abuse, so those employed by Him as the instruments of His loving-kindness become the very executioners of his "fury." The "coals of fire," the symbols of Divine wrath, are represented as "between the cherubim." In every possible way it is signified that the impending doom is not from man's will, however men may be used as its instruments, or from any accident, but from God Himself.<p><span class= "bld">Scatter them over the city.</span>--For its destruction.

It intimated that the fire of Divine wrath, which kindles judgment upon a people, is just and holy; and in the great day, the earth, and all the works that are therein, will be burnt up.</body></html>
