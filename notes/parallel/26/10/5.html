They were now just on the eve of going away, and the movement was a great one, so that the sound was "heard even to the outer court" Throughout this chapter the s in cherubims is quite unnecessary, since cherubim is already the Hebrew plural of cherub.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.">Ezekiel 10:6-7</a> are not subsequent in time to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm" title="And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.">Ezekiel 10:5</a>, but are simply a more particular account, given parenthetically, of what had already been briefly mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.">Ezekiel 10:2</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-8.htm" title="And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.">Ezekiel 10:8-17</a> are largely a repetition of the description of the vision in Ezekiel 1, but it is here given in parts, parenthetically, in connection with the progress of the narrative. The course of the narrative itself is as follows :--After the man in linen has gone out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-7.htm" title="And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.">Ezekiel 10:7</a>), a command is issued, "O wheel." They were to set themselves in motion. Then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15</a>) they "were lifted up," and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-18.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>) "the glory of the Lord departed" from the Temple, and "mounted up from the earth." The repetition of the description of Ezekiel 1 is by no means accidental, but serves partly to connect the various particulars with the course of the symbolic narrative, and mainly to emphasize the identity of the glory departing from the Temple with the Divine glory before seen. There are, however, several variations from the former description. Particularly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-12.htm" title="And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.">Ezekiel 10:12</a> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>) there is mention of the abundance of eyes, a symbol of vigilance and activity, covering the whole body of the cherubim and the wheels. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-14.htm" title="And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 10:14</a>, after saying that "every one had four faces," as in Ezekiel 1, the particular faces are described, but with this important variation :--the first is said to be "the face of a cherub," instead of "the face of an ox," as in Ezekiel 1; more exactly it is "the face of <span class= "ital">the </span>cherub," since the Hebrew has the definite article. The reason of this variation and the meaning of "the face of the cherub" are both obscure. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-22.htm" title="And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.">Ezekiel 10:22</a> it is expressly said that their faces were the same as those seen by the Chebar; and again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15-20</a>, the whole vision is described as the "living creature" seen by the Chebar. It is plain, therefore, that the variation is only in the description, and not in the thing described. The most natural solution of the difficulty in the text as it stands is that a cherub was ordinarily represented with the face of an ox. But there is no evidence of this, and it is not impossible that a slight error may have been introduced into the text. The Greek version did not contain the verse in the time of St. Jerome, and in its Roman form does not now. It was introduced into the Alexandrian copies from the later version of Theodotion, and Theodoret does not recognise it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sound of the cherubim.</span> The use of <span class="cmt_word">God Almighty</span> (<span class="accented">El Shaddai</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>), the name of God as ruling over nature, while Jehovah expressed his covenant relationship to Israel, is, it may be noted, characteristic of the early stage of the religion of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-3.htm">Genesis 48:3</a>). <span class="accented">Shaddai</span> alone appears eighty-one times in the Book of Job. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>. explains the voice of El Shaddai (though there it is "the voice of Jehovah") as meaning the roar of the thunder. The hands of the "living creatures," now recognized as cherubim, had been mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>, and it is one of those hands that gives the fire into the hands of the linen vested minister of wrath. The elemental forces of nature, of which the cherubim are, partly at least, the symbols, are working out the purposes of Jehovah. The two words translated <span class="cmt_word">wheels</span> are different in the Hebrew. The first is singular and collective (<span class="accented">galgal</span>, the "whirling thing," used of the wheel of a war chariot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-24.htm">Ezekiel 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>), and might well be translated "chariot" here. The second, that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15, 16</a>, also in the singular, is applied to the single wheel of the four by which the angel, ministers stood. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The fire being taken from between the wheels, under the cherubim, ch. 1:13, seems to have signified the wrath of God to be executed upon Jerusalem. It intimated that the fire of Divine wrath, which kindles judgment upon a people, is just and holy; and in the great day, the earth, and all the works that are therein, will be burnt up.</body></html>
