No mention is here made of a being upon the throne, but it is implied by the "he spake" of the following verse. The word <span class= "ital">cherubim </span>corresponds throughout this chapter to the <span class= "ital">living creatures </span>of Ezekiel 1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I looked,</span> etc. There follows on the work of judgment another theophany, like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15-28</a>. In the "expanse," or firmament, like the "terrible crystal," there is seen as before the likeness of a sapphire throne (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>, note). The form of <span class="cmt_word">the man</span> who is the manifestation of Jehovah is implied, though not named. It is he who speaks to the captain of the six ministers of vengeance, himself the seventh, and bids him go in beneath the "whirling wheels" that are beneath the cherub (collective singular, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>), and fill his hands with <span class="cmt_word">coals of fire</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a>), and scatter them over the city, as the symbol of its doom. We are reminded of Isaiah's vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a>); but there the work of the fire was to purify, here simply to destroy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the cherubim stood,</span> etc. The position of the cherubim is defined, with a vivid distinctness of detail, which once more reminds us of Dante.

What follows is probably a reproduction of the change of positions described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>, and the verbs should be taken, therefore, as pluperfects. The cloud of glory, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10, 11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1, 2</a>, the Shechinah, that was the taken of the Divine presence, filled the court, but the glory itself had moved to the threshold at the first stage of its departure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The fire being taken from between the wheels, under the cherubim, ch. 1:13, seems to have signified the wrath of God to be executed upon Jerusalem. It intimated that the fire of Divine wrath, which kindles judgment upon a people, is just and holy; and in the great day, the earth, and all the works that are therein, will be burnt up.</body></html>
