And he went in in my sight.">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, the singular, <span class= "ital">cherub, </span>instead of the usual plural. Here it is thought to designate, not the four living creatures of the vision, but the cherubim overshadowing the mercy-seat, and to indicate that the manifestation of the Divine presence now left the Holy of Holies, and went to the threshold of the door of the house, preparatory to leaving it altogether. The expression is obscure, since the place of the manifestation of the Divine presence in the most holy place is usually described as "between the cherubim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-89.htm" title="And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking to him from off the mercy seat that was on the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.">Numbers 7:89</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm" title="The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.">Psalm 99:1</a>, &c.). Of the main point, however, there can be no doubt--that the Divine presence is represented as in the act of leaving the Temple. "The house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory" as He departed, in striking contrast with the similar manifestations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,">1Kings 8:10-11</a>), when God accepted the tabernacle and the Temple as the peculiar place of His abode.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The fire being taken from between the wheels, under the cherubim, ch. 1:13, seems to have signified the wrath of God to be executed upon Jerusalem. It intimated that the fire of Divine wrath, which kindles judgment upon a people, is just and holy; and in the great day, the earth, and all the works that are therein, will be burnt up.</body></html>
