In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a> the "rings" of the wheels were "full of eyes." Here the eyes are everywhere. It is not hard to interpret this part of the vision. The prophet receives a new impression of the all-seeing eye of Jehovah. Everywhere, as he stands face to face with the forces of nature, he can say, <span class="accented">must</span> say, within himself, "Thou God seest me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>). There is an eye that looks upon him where he least expects it. The same thought appears in the stone with seven eyes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>. St. John reproduces it in the same form as Ezekiel, with the exception of the wheels, which form no part of his vision, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:8-22 Ezekiel sees the working of Divine providence in the government of the lower world, and the affairs of it. When God is leaving a people in displeasure, angels above, and all events below, further his departure. The Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, directs all creatures, in heaven and on earth, so as to make them serve the Divine purpose. God removes by degrees from a provoking people; and, when ready to depart, would return to them, if they were a repenting, praying people. Let this warn sinners to seek the Lord while he may be found, and to call on him while he is near, and cause us all to walk humbly and watchfully with our God.</body></html>
