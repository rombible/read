Yet of them all alike it was still true that they were much more ready to listen with deferential air to the words of the prophet than to take them to their hearts and act upon them in their life. The prophet is here warned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/33-30.htm" title="Also, you son of man, the children of your people still are talking against you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the LORD.">Ezekiel 33:30-33</a>) not to be misled by the apparent compliance of the people, as he had been before strengthened against their opposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/3-8.htm" title="Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.">Ezekiel 3:8-9</a>); but it must have carried a pang deep into his heart to know how superficial was the effect of those labours to which he had devoted himself with such faithfulness.<p><span class= "bld">Against thee.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">of thee.</span> The people are not represented as opposed to Ezekiel, but rather as enjoying his eloquence, and talking about him as they met one another, but without any serious effort to follow his counsels--much like the treatment of a popular preacher by his people at the present day.<p>By <span class= "bld">the walls and</span> in the <span class= "bld">doors.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">within the walls.</span> The meaning is, both privately and publicly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of thy people</span>. The words, like those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-1.htm">Ezekiel 14:1</a> and Ezekiel 20:1, 49, throw light on the prophet's relations to his people. Now that the long silence was broken, and the prophet spoke with greater freedom than he had ever done before, he acquired a fresh notoriety. The character of his last utterance, vindicating, as it might seem, the claim of the exiles to "possess the land," as against that of the remnant "in the wastes," may even have made him popular. The Authorized Version <span class="cmt_word">against</span> is misleading; read, with the margin and the Revised Version, <span class="accented">about</span>. There was for the time no open hostility. They talked much, in places of private or public resort, of the prophet's new action. Each invited his neighbor to go and hear the prophet as he spake to them his message from Jehovah. And they came <span class="cmt_word">as the people cometh</span>, in crowds, even <span class="cmt_word">as my people</span>, the people of Jehovah, with reverent gestures and listening eagerly. Never before, we may well believe, had the prophet had so large or so promising a congregation. But he was taught to look below the surface and to read their thoughts, and there he read, as preachers of all ages have too often read after him, that they were hearers, and not doers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23-25</a>). In words they <span class="cmt_word">showed much love</span> (the LXX. gives "falsehood"), spoke pleasant things, but the root-evil, the besetting sin, was still there. Their heart went after their covetousness (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:30-33 Unworthy and corrupt motives often lead men to the places where the word of God is faithfully preached. Many come to find somewhat to oppose: far more come of curiosity or mere habit. Men may have their hearts changed. But whether men hear or forbear, they will know by the event that a servant of God has been among them. All who will not know the worth of mercies by the improvement of them, will justly be made to know their worth by the want of them.</body></html>
