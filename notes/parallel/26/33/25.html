The crimes here charged upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/33-25.htm" title="Why say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall you possess the land?">Ezekiel 33:25-26</a>) are the same as those all along alleged against them, and Jeremiah gives a sad picture of their open rebellion against the express commands of God (Jeremiah 42, 43). This particular sin of eating flesh with the blood had been repeatedly forbidden, first to Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm" title="But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat.">Genesis 9:4</a>), and again under the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-17.htm" title="It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither fat nor blood.">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-26.htm" title="Moreover you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.">Leviticus 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-16.htm" title="Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth as water.">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye eat with the blood</span>. It is characteristic of Ezekiel that the first offence which he names with horror should be a sin against a positive commandment. He felt, as it were, a sense of loathing at what seemed to him a descent into the worst form of pollution, forbidden, not to the Jews only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>), but to mankind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>); compare the scene in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>. The same feeling shows itself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20, 29</a>. The prohibition of blood took its place, in later Judaism, as among the precepts of Noah, which were binding even on the proselytes of the gate, upon whom, as distinct from the proselytes of righteousness, the rite of circumcision was not enforced; and as such were accepted by the council at Jerusalem, as binding also among Christian converts. Not for such as these was the inheritance of Israel, and the prophet asks indignantly, after naming yet . more hateful offenses, <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye possess the land?</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:21-29 Those are unteachable indeed, who do not learn their dependence upon God, when all creature-comforts fail. Many claim an interest in the peculiar blessings to true believers, while their conduct proves them enemies of God. They call this groundless presumption strong faith, when God's testimony declares them entitled to his threatenings, and nothing else.</body></html>
