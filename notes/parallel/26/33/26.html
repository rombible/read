The words point to the open assertion of the law that might is right. Men relied on the sword, and on that only, for their support. Assassinations, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41.htm">Jeremiah 41</a>, were, so to speak, as the order of the day. <span class="cmt_word">Ye work abomination</span>. The noun, Ezekiel's ever-recurring word, indicates both the act of idolatry and the foul orgiastic rites that accompanied it. The verb, curiously enough, has the feminine suffix. Was it used intentionally, either as pointing to the prominence of women in those rites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>), or to the degrading vices which involved the loss of true manhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>)? So some have thought; but I agree with Keil, Smend, and others, in seeing only an error of transcription. Once more, after heaping up his accusations, Ezekiel asks the question, "Shall ye possess the land?" "Are you the seed of Abraham?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:21-29 Those are unteachable indeed, who do not learn their dependence upon God, when all creature-comforts fail. Many claim an interest in the peculiar blessings to true believers, while their conduct proves them enemies of God. They call this groundless presumption strong faith, when God's testimony declares them entitled to his threatenings, and nothing else.</body></html>
