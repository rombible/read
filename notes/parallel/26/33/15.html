In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7, 12, 16</a>, this and its opposite had been grouped with other forms of good and evil. Here it stands out in solitary preeminence. The reason may possibly be found in the fact that a time of exile and suffering was likely to make the sin, which the penitent thus showed that he had renounced, a specially common one. The starving man pledged his garment or his tools for the loan of money or of food at a price far below its value. There was a real self-sacrifice, a proof of the power of the faith that worketh by love, when the creditor restored it. The primary duty, when a man turned from evil, was, as far as in him lay, to overcome his besetting sin and make restitution for the past. Compare the words of the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-12.htm">Luke 3:12-14</a>), and those of Zacchaeus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The statutes of life</span>. The words are used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>, on the assumption that, if a man kept the statutes, he should (in the highest sense of the word) live in them. It was reserved for the fuller illumination of St. Paul, taught by a representative experience to proclaim the higher truth that the <span class="accented">Law</span>, ordained for life, was yet the minister of condemnation and death unless there was something higher than itself to complete the work which it could only begin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:10-20 Those who despaired of finding mercy with God, are answered with a solemn declaration of God's readiness to show mercy. The ruin of the city and state was determined, but that did not relate to the final state of persons. God says to the righteous, that he shall surely live. But many who have made profession, have been ruined by proud confidence in themselves. Man trusts to his own righteousness, and presuming on his own sufficiency, he is brought to commit iniquity. If those who have lived a wicked life repent and forsake their wicked ways, they shall be saved. Many such amazing and blessed changes have been wrought by the power of Divine grace. When there is a settled separation between a man and sin, there shall no longer be a separation between him and God.</body></html>
