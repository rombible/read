Yet these verses have also a distinct retrospective object, and explain to the people why he had hitherto spoken to them so much of judgments and in such warning tones; this had been his duty, both in obedience to God's commands and in regard for their welfare, and it would still be his duty in the future. The passage is too clear to need comment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak to the children of thy people</span>. (On the force of the possessive pronoun, see note on Ezekiel 3:1.) The formula is carried on throughout the chapter (Vers. 12, 17, 30). <span class="cmt_word">Set him for their watchman</span>. Ezekiel falls back upon the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>, but the image is expanded with characteristic fullness. The function of the watchman, in which he sees a parable of his own office, is to stand upon his tower (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), to keep his eye on the distant horizon, and as soon as the clouds of dust or the gleam of armor gives notice of the approach of the enemy, to sound the trumpet of alarm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>), that men may not be taken unawares. If he discharge that duty faithfully, then, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-21</a>, the blood of those that perish through their own negligence shall rest on their own head. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-9 The prophet is a watchman to the house of Israel. His business is to warn sinners of their misery and danger. He must warn the wicked to turn from their way, that they may live. If souls perish through his neglect of duty, he brings guilt upon himself. See what those have to answer for, who make excuses for sin, flatter sinners, and encourage them to believe they shall have peace, though they go on. How much wiser are men in their temporal than in their spiritual concerns! They set watchmen to guard their houses, and sentinels to warn of the enemies' approach, but where the everlasting happiness or misery of the soul is at stake, they are offended if ministers obey their Master's command, and give a faithful warning; they would rather perish, listening to smooth things.</body></html>
