They trusted in the promises of the false prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6</a>). They laid to their soul the flattering unction that they were suffering, not for their own sins, but for the sins of their fathers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>). Now they stand face to face with the fulfillment of the prophet's words. They cherish no hopes, and they make no excuses. They have fallen into the abyss of despair. Admitting their own sin and the righteousness of their punishment, does not the very admission exclude hope? Who can bring life to those that are thus dead in trespasses and sins? The parallelism with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39-42</a> is so striking that it can scarcely be accidental <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:10-20 Those who despaired of finding mercy with God, are answered with a solemn declaration of God's readiness to show mercy. The ruin of the city and state was determined, but that did not relate to the final state of persons. God says to the righteous, that he shall surely live. But many who have made profession, have been ruined by proud confidence in themselves. Man trusts to his own righteousness, and presuming on his own sufficiency, he is brought to commit iniquity. If those who have lived a wicked life repent and forsake their wicked ways, they shall be saved. Many such amazing and blessed changes have been wrought by the power of Divine grace. When there is a settled separation between a man and sin, there shall no longer be a separation between him and God.</body></html>
