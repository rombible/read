When the messenger arrived he found the prophet in a state of ecstasy. This was in the evening. In that prophetic ecstasy his mouth was opened, and the long silence broken, and though he had not heard the message with his outward ears, he had taken, as it were, that message as his text. It was not till his discourse was ended, and the morning came, that he himself heard the terrible tidings from the lips of the messenger. Then a change came over him. He was no more dumb. The long silence was broken. Had the silence lasted, we ask, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a> onward? Had the whole intervening period been one of simply symbolic action, and of written but unspoken prophecies? The words at first suggest that conclusion; but it is traveled by the facts; by the commands of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-10.htm">Ezekiel 12:10, 23</a>; by the order to "prophesy" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>; by the message to speak unto the elders in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>; by the question, "Doth he not speak parables?" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>. I infer, therefore, that, though the silence had been dominant, it had not been unbroken. To some, at least, a message had been spoken. Others may have been allowed to read the written prophecies. The death of the prophet's wife tended, probably, to the continuance of the silence, and it seems a legitimate inference from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a> that it had continued from that date onward. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:21-29 Those are unteachable indeed, who do not learn their dependence upon God, when all creature-comforts fail. Many claim an interest in the peculiar blessings to true believers, while their conduct proves them enemies of God. They call this groundless presumption strong faith, when God's testimony declares them entitled to his threatenings, and nothing else.</body></html>
