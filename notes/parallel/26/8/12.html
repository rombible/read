Hence the difficulty of access to the place of their worship. The ordinary idolatries of Israel, as of most heathen, consisted in the worship of the true, or of a supposed spiritual Deity, by means of sensible images (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-8.htm" title="They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be your gods, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 32:8</a>). This was open and public enough at Jerusalem at this time; but the peculiar sin here portrayed was the actual worship of the creature by means of images and paintings. This, although joined in by the chief people of the nation, was practised secretly, perhaps, not only for the purpose of concealing its Egyptian tendencies from the Chaldaeans, but also to throw over it the charm of mystery, as was so common among the heathen.<p><span class= "bld">Every man in the chambers of his imagery.--</span>By "chambers of imagery" (the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm" title="You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 26:1</a>) is intended chambers painted with images like the one now shown to the prophet. This was not a solitary case; on the contrary, it was but an example of what was done everywhere. The people stifled the voice of conscience then, as in every age, by saying "The LORD seeth us n<span class= "ital">ot," </span>comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm" title="He has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he hides his face; he will never see it.">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm" title="Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.">Psalm 94:7</a>, &c. Yet, besides this, they argued, doubtless from the calamities that <span class= "ital">had </span>already fallen upon their country, "the LORD hath forsaken the earth," or. rather, the land; and therefore they must have recourse to other help. But the prophet was to see yet worse things.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man,</span> etc. And this, after all, was but a sample of the prevalence of the Egyptian influence. Other elders had, <span class="cmt_word">in the dark</span>, a like <span class="accented">adytum</span>, a like chamber of imagery, like the Latin <span class="accented">lararium</span>, filled. with a like cloud of incense. And though the name of the leader of the band might have warned them that the Lord was listening, they boasted, in their blindness, that Jehovah did not see them; he had forsaken the temple, and had fiche elsewhere. They thought of Jehovah as of a local deity who had abdicated. They were free to do as they liked without fear. The words are worth noting further as the first of a series of popular half proverbs, in which the thoughts of the people clothed themselves (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>). All these imply some personal knowledge of what was passing in Jerusalem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-12 A secret place was, as it were, opened, where the prophet saw creatures painted on the walls, and a number of the elders of Israel worshipped before them. No superiority in worldly matters will preserve men from lust, or idolatries, when they are left to their own deceitful hearts; and those who are soon wearied in the service of God, often grudge no toil nor expense when following their superstitions. When hypocrites screen themselves behind the wall of an outward profession, there is some hole or other left in the wall, something that betrays them to those who look diligently. There is a great deal of secret wickedness in the world. They think themselves out of God's sight. But those are ripe indeed for ruin, who lay the blame of their sins upon the Lord.</body></html>
