That vision bursts again on the prophet after he has been carried in the spirit to the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.">Ezekiel 8:4</a>). This is not expressly described as a human form, but from the mention of the loins, and of "the form of an hand," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a> it is implied that it was so. No further description is given, except that it was something bright and glorious like fire; and by the repetition of the words "likeness," "appearance," and "form of an hand," the prophet here, as in Ezekiel 1, takes pains to show that it was only a vision, not an outward reality. It is also to be remembered that this and the subsequent vision occurred while the elders were sitting before the prophet. They saw nothing themselves, but must have witnessed his ecstasy, and thus have been prepared for his telling them at its close (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-25.htm" title="Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had showed me.">Ezekiel 11:25</a>) "all the things that the Lord had showed" him. "The colour of amber" is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, where see Note.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beheld, and lo a likeness,</span> etc. The vision opens with a theophany like that of ch. 1; but here, as there, Ezekiel uses the word which emphasizes the fact that what he had seen was but a "likeness" of the ineffable glory, an image of the Unseen. (For "amber," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4, 27</a>.) In this case we note the absence of the cherubic figures. It is simply the "appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah," seen now in the glow of fire, without the milder, more hopeful brightness of the rainbow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The glorious personage Ezekiel beheld in vision, seemed to take hold upon him, and he was conveyed in spirit to Jerusalem. There, in the inner court of the temple, was prepared a place for some base idol. The whole was presented in vision to the prophet.
