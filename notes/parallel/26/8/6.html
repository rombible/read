The latter sense, however, which is that given in the Authorised Version, is more probable and more in accordance with the whole teaching of the vision. There was a strong feeling among the people that they were safe at Jerusalem; God, Whom they still regarded, notwithstanding their idolatries, as a powerful national God, would certainly protect His temple. It is the office of the prophet to show that, the transgressions of the people led, as their natural consequence, to his giving over the city to desolation. The "great abominations" spoken of are the constant refrain of this chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.">Ezekiel 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-13.htm" title="He said also to me, Turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations that they do.">Ezekiel 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-15.htm" title="Then said he to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations than these.">Ezekiel 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm" title="Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, see, they put the branch to their nose.">Ezekiel 8:17</a>). The people's own acts make necessary the judgments impending over them. Still worse is in store.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I should go far off,</span> etc. The lesson taught was that already implied in the fact that the glorious vision and come to him from the north (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>). The temple was already as a God-deserted shrine. His return to it now was but the coming of the Judge and the Destroyer. We are reminded of the <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, ("Let us depart hence"), which was heard in the darkness of the night before the later destruction of Jerusalem (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.' 6:05.3) Bad begins, but worse remains behind. The prophet is led onward as through the successive stages of an <span class="accented">inferno</span> of idolatries. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The glorious personage Ezekiel beheld in vision, seemed to take hold upon him, and he was conveyed in spirit to Jerusalem. There, in the inner court of the temple, was prepared a place for some base idol. The whole was presented in vision to the prophet. If it should please God to give any man a clear view of his glory and majesty, and of all the abominations committing in any one city, he would then admit the justice of the severest punishments God should inflict thereon.</body></html>
