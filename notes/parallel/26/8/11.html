but again we are to remember that as this is in vision and for purposes of instruction, it is not necessary that all the details should be actually possible. The seventy elders were not the sanhedrin, which was not constituted until after the return from Babylon; but the number has probable reference to the seventy chosen to enjoy with Moses the Theophany of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-9.htm" title="Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:">Exodus 24:9-10</a>, and the other seventy selected to share with him in the gifts of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.">Numbers 11:16</a>). In contrast with those selected for especial nearness to God, these seventy are engaged in abominations most abhorrent to Him.<p><span class= "bld">Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan.</span>--<span class= "ital">Son </span>is perhaps used here, as often in Scripture, in the sense of <span class= "ital">grandson. </span>In this case he may have been the same with "Jaazaniah, the son of Azur," mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm" title="Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the LORD's house, which looks eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.">Ezekiel 11:1</a> as one of the wicked princes of the people, against whom Ezekiel was directed to prophesy. It is hardly probable that two persons of the same character and the same (not very common) name should have been among the leaders of the people at the same time. The mention of his grandfather here would be appropriate, as bringing out the contrast in their characters, and showing the change for the worse that had been going on among the people. Shaphan was an officer of the court of King Josiah, and active in the reformation instituted by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,">2Kings 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>); while his son (Elasah) was one of the messengers by whom Jeremiah sent his prophecies to the Captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-3.htm" title="By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,">Jeremiah 29:3</a>); and another son, Gemariah, was a scribe, having a chamber "in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the Lord's house," in the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>). At the same time his grandson, Michaiah, was sufficiently prominent at court to join in the intercession of the princes against the destruction of Jeremiah's prophecies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-11.htm" title="When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,">Jeremiah 36:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a>); and a little later, in the general captivity of the ninth year of Zedekiah, another grandson, Gedaliah, had the person of Jeremiah given into his charge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm" title="Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelled among the people.">Jeremiah 39:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm" title="Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wherever it seems convenient to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.">Jeremiah 40:5</a>), and was made governor over the remnant of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm" title="Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;">Jeremiah 40:11</a>). Such being the family connections of Jaazaniah, the corruption which could make him a leader of idolatry is strongly shown.<p><span class= "bld">With every man his censer in his hand.</span>--The burning of incense was the exclusive function of the priesthood (Numbers 16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.">2Chronicles 26:16-18</a>); and it was alike the necessity and the choice of the idolaters of Israel to devolve this office upon those who were not of the Aaronic family. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm" title="And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.">1Kings 12:31</a>.) When the seventy elders offered incense to their idols they claimed thereby to be the priests of those idols.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seventy men</span>, etc. The number was probably chosen with reference to the "elders" who had seen the Divine glory in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9, 10</a>. The Sanhedrin, or council of seventy, did not exist till after the Captivity. The number can scarcely have been accidental, and may imply that the elders were formally representative. Another Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>; yet another, the son of Azur, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>. If the Shaphan mentioned is the scribe, the son of Azaliah, under Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>), the father of Ahikam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12</a>), of Elasah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>), and of Gemariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10, 11, 12</a>), and the grandfather of Gedaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), all of whom were prominent in the reform movement under Josiah, or as friends of Jeremiah, and no other Shaphan appears in history, the fact that one of his sons is the leader of the idolatrous company must have had for Ezekiel a specially painful significance. He could scarcely have forgotten the meaning of his name, "The Lord is listening," and probably refers to it in ver. 12. As the climax of this chamber of horrors, the seventy elders were all acting as priests, and were offering to their pictured idols the incense which none but the sons of Aaron had a right to use, and which they offered to Jehovah only. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-12 A secret place was, as it were, opened, where the prophet saw creatures painted on the walls, and a number of the elders of Israel worshipped before them. No superiority in worldly matters will preserve men from lust, or idolatries, when they are left to their own deceitful hearts; and those who are soon wearied in the service of God, often grudge no toil nor expense when following their superstitions. When hypocrites screen themselves behind the wall of an outward profession, there is some hole or other left in the wall, something that betrays them to those who look diligently. There is a great deal of secret wickedness in the world. They think themselves out of God's sight. But those are ripe indeed for ruin, who lay the blame of their sins upon the Lord.</body></html>
