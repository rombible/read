Tammuz is nowhere else mentioned in Scripture, but is identified by ancient tradition (incorporated into the Vulg.) with the Greek Adonis, the beloved of Venus. The name <span class= "ital">Adonis </span>could not well have been used, because in its Hebrew form it means <span class= "ital">Lord, </span>and is frequently used of God. His worship is first heard of in Phoenicia, and was wide-spread throughout Syria and the adjacent countries. As the creature worship before mentioned was undoubtedly connected with political reasons, while aid was being sought from Egypt, so the worship of Adonis may have been affected by the league which Zedekiah attempted to form (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/27-1.htm" title="In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 27:1-11</a>) with the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Philistines against Nebuchadnezzar. The annual feast of Adonis consisted of a mourning by the women for his death, followed by a rejoicing over his return to life, and was accompanied by great abominations and licentiousness. The myth of Adonis was also closely associated with the worship of nature. This festival did not fall in the "sixth month," but the description is not necessarily of what was actually occurring at the moment; there is brought before the prophet's vision a representation of the wickedness practised at various times in Jerusalem. Women engaged in the service of idolatry near the Temple are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm" title="And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.">2Kings 23:7</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>.)<p>Thus far, the prophet has seen in the different courts of the Temple the general image worship of the people, then the creature worship of their elders, and now the corrupt and debasing rites of their women.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, there sat women wailing for Tammuz.</span> The point of view is probably the same as that of ver. 3, but the women were apparently in the outer porch of it, as he has to be brought to the gate in order to see them. We are led to note two things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the general prominence of women in the later idolatry of Judah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the specific character of the Tammuz worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Under <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we have the women who wove hangings for the Ashera (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>), those who had burnt incense to other gods, especially to the queen of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9, 15-19</a>), probably, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to Ashtaroth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The name <span class="accented">Tammuz</span> does not meet us elsewhere in the Old Testament. All interpreters, however, agree that it answers to the Adonis of Greek mythology. So Jerome translates it, and expressly states (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.) that what Ezekiel saw corresponded to the Adonis festivals. It may be enough to state, without going into the details of the story, that Adonis, the beautiful youth beloved of Aphrodite, was slain by a wild boar; that after his death he was allowed to spend six months of each year with her, while the other was passed with Persephone in Hades. The cultus thus became the symbol of the annual decay and revival of nature; but the legend rather than the inner meaning was in the thoughts of the worshippers. The emotions of women poured themselves out in lamentations over the waxen image of the beautiful dead youth who had perished in his prime, and in orgiastic joy over his return to life. Milton, deriving his knowledge, probably, from Selden's 'De Diis Syris,' has painted the whole atone in words which may well be quoted - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Thammuz next came behind,<br />Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured<br />The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br />In amorous ditties all a summer's day;<br />While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br />Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br />Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale<br />Infected Sion's daughters with like heat;<br />Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch<br />Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,<br />His eyes surveyed the dark idolatries<br />Of alienated Judah."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Par. Lost,' 1:446, etc.</span>) The chief centre of the Tammuz-Adonis worship was Byblos, in Syria. but it spread widely over the shores of the Mediterranean and was fashionable both in Alexandria and Athens. One of the practices of the festival, that of planting flowers in vases for forced cultivation, has been perpetuated by Plato's allusion to "the gardens of Adonis" as the type of transitoriness ('Phaedr.' p. 376, b). Cheyne, following Lagarde, finds a reference to the cultus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>: 66:17. The festival of Ishtar and Tammuz (or <span class="accented">Tam-zi</span>) at Babylon presented a marked parallel. Adonis is, with hardly a doubt, identical with the Hebrew <span class="accented">Adonai</span> (equivalent to "Lord"). <span class="accented">Tammuz</span> has been explained as meaning "victorious," or "disappearance," or "burning;" but all etymologies are conjectural. Lastly, it is not without interest to note <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that when Jerome wrote, the Cave of the Nativity at Bethlehem was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz ('Ep. ad Paul.'); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the later Jewish calendar included the month of Tammuz, which corresponded to July. The festival seems to have been celebrated at the summer solstice. The time of Ezekiel's vision was in the sixth month, <span class="accented">sc.</span> about the time of the autumnal equinox (see 'Dict. Bible,' art. "Tammuz"). Mr. Baring-Gould, treating the legend as a solar myth, finds the old Phoenician deity represented in the "St. George of Merrie England" ('Curious Myths,' pp. 277-316). An exhaustive monograph, "Tammuz Adonis," has been published by Liebrecht, in his 'Zur Volkskunde' (1879), reprinted from the <span class="accented">Zeitschrift Deutschen Morgen-Gesellschaft</span>, vol. 17. pp. 397, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:13-18 The yearly lamenting for Tammuz was attended with infamous practices; and the worshippers of the sun here described, are supposed to have been priests. The Lord appeals to the prophet concerning the heinousness of the crime; and lo, they put the branch to their nose, denoting some custom used by idolaters in honour of the idols they served. The more we examine human nature and our own hearts, the more abominations we shall discover; and the longer the believer searches himself, the more he will humble himself before God, and the more will he value the fountain open for sin, and seek to wash therein.</body></html>
