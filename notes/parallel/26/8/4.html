The identity of the vision is again particularly mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-22.htm" title="And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.">Ezekiel 10:22</a>, and even without this would be plain from the description given of it in Ezekiel 10. At the same time, various particulars are mentioned (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-12.htm" title="And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.">Ezekiel 10:12</a>) which were omitted in Ezekiel 1, and others are mentioned there which are omitted here, as the cloud and the firmament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm" title="And the likeness of the firmament on the heads of the living creature was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.">Ezekiel 1:22</a>); and there are also some entirely new features introduced, as the "six men" and "the man clothed in linen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.">Ezekiel 9:2</a>), for which there was no occasion in the former vision. "The God of Israel" is emphatic, the God who had loved and chosen Israel, and Whom Israel should have served, in contrast with the idol which they had placed in His temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold,</span> etc. In appalling contrast with that "image of jealousy," Ezekiel saw what he had not seen, as he first became conscious that he was in the court of the temple - the vision of the Divine glory, such as he had seen it on the banks of Chebar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>). He was to look first on this picture and then on that, and the guilt of Judah was measured by that contrast. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The glorious personage Ezekiel beheld in vision, seemed to take hold upon him, and he was conveyed in spirit to Jerusalem. There, in the inner court of the temple, was prepared a place for some base idol. The whole was presented in vision to the prophet. If it should please God to give any man a clear view of his glory and majesty, and of all the abominations committing in any one city, he would then admit the justice of the severest punishments God should inflict thereon.</body></html>
