He had been inside the inner court near its north gate; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a> he is taken to the north gate of the outer enclosure of the temple precincts. It is probable, therefore, that this was between them. We do not know from the description of Solomon's temple that there were any other than the inner and the outer courts; but as there were others in the temple of Herod built upon the same area, it is altogether likely that there was a further division, and that it was to such a dividing wall, with chambers attached, that the prophet was now brought. Here he finds a hole, or window, too small for entrance, and is directed to enlarge it that he may go in. Having done so, he finds a door which he is told to enter. The object of this part of the vision is to show the extreme secrecy of what he is now to see--a, secrecy made necessary by the connection of this idolatry with Egypt, the foe of Chaldaea. Any question in regard to the way the idolaters themselves entered is out of place, as all is only in vision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the door of the court.</span> What follows suggests that the prophet was led to the gate that opened from the inner to the outer court. This gas surrounded by chambers or cells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>). The term for "wall" (<span class="accented">kir</span>) is that specially used for the wall which encloses a whole group of buildings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Behold a hole in the wall.</span> The fact was clearly significant. The worship here was more clandestine than that of the "image of jealousy." We are not warranted, perhaps, in insisting on minute consistency in the world of visions, but the question naturally arises - How did the worshippers enter the chamber if Ezekiel had to enlarge the hole in the wall in order to get in? We may surmise that the entrance from the temple court had been blocked up all but entirely in the days of Josiah, that the idolaters now entered it from without or through some other chamber, while Ezekiel thinks of himself as coming upon them like a spy in the dim distance of the covered passage through which he made his way. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-12 A secret place was, as it were, opened, where the prophet saw creatures painted on the walls, and a number of the elders of Israel worshipped before them. No superiority in worldly matters will preserve men from lust, or idolatries, when they are left to their own deceitful hearts; and those who are soon wearied in the service of God, often grudge no toil nor expense when following their superstitions. When hypocrites screen themselves behind the wall of an outward profession, there is some hole or other left in the wall, something that betrays them to those who look diligently. There is a great deal of secret wickedness in the world. They think themselves out of God's sight. But those are ripe indeed for ruin, who lay the blame of their sins upon the Lord.</body></html>
