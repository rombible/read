These are probably the high priest and the heads of the twenty-four courses, representing the whole body of the priests, as the elders represented the whole body of the people. They were standing between the altar and the Temple, therefore in the most sacred part of the court, and there, turning their backs upon the Temple of the Lord, worshipped the sun. The adoration of the sun, probably the earliest form of false religion, was the especial worship of Persia, but had been long since practised by the kings and people of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm" title="And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2Kings 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm" title="And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.">2Kings 23:11</a>). Thus all classes of the nation are seen to be involved in common sin; and the priests particularly, the especial guardians of true religion, are found practising this sin under circumstances of peculiar insult to God. That the "chief priests" did pollute the sanctuary at this time is expressly asserted in the history at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm" title="Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He brought me into the inner court.</span> The last and the worst form of desecration follows. It was the "inner court" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>) which, after the exile, was entered only by the priests. During the monarchy, however, it seems to have been accessible to kings and other persons of importance, as in the case of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22, 64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>) in the revolution against Athaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4-15</a>), and Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a>), and Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>). Ezekiel does not say that the men whom he saw were priests, though the number twenty-five suggests that they were taking the place of the high priest and the heads of the twenty-four courses of the priesthood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-4.htm">1 Chronicles 24:4-19</a>), and so symbolized the whole order of the priesthood as the seventy elders represented the laity. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a> the chief of the priests is spoken of as having been prominent in "polluting the house of the Lord." They were seen turning their backs to the temple of Jehovah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sanctuary. The very act was symbolical of their apostasy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>). And they did this in order that they might look to the east and worship the rising sun. That, and not the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), was the <span class="accented">Kiblah</span> of their adoration. The sun worship here appears to have had a Persian character, as being offered to the sun itself, and not to Baal, as a solar god. Of such a worship we have traces in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5, 11</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:13-18 The yearly lamenting for Tammuz was attended with infamous practices; and the worshippers of the sun here described, are supposed to have been priests. The Lord appeals to the prophet concerning the heinousness of the crime; and lo, they put the branch to their nose, denoting some custom used by idolaters in honour of the idols they served. The more we examine human nature and our own hearts, the more abominations we shall discover; and the longer the believer searches himself, the more he will humble himself before God, and the more will he value the fountain open for sin, and seek to wash therein.</body></html>
