It is unnecessary here to think of heat as removing the rust (scum) from the cauldron; the prophet's mind is not upon any physical effect, but upon the methods of purifying defiled metallic vessels under the law (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-23.htm" title="Every thing that may abide the fire, you shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that stays not the fire you shall make go through the water.">Numbers 31:23</a>). It was a symbolical rather than a material purification, and in the present case involved the actual destruction of the city itself. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/24-11.htm" title="Then set it empty on the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.">Ezekiel 24:11-14</a>, the obduracy of the people is set forth in strong language, together with the completeness of the coming judgment in contrast to the in-effectiveness of all former efforts for their reformation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-13.htm" title="In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest on you.">Ezekiel 24:13</a>); and, finally, the adaptation of the punishment to the sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-14.htm" title="I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 24:14</a>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The word translated "lies" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-12.htm" title="She has wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.">Ezekiel 24:12</a> means <span class= "ital">pains </span>or <span class= "ital">labour. </span>Translate, <span class= "ital">The labour is in vain; her rust does not go out of her, even her rust with fire. </span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-13.htm" title="In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest on you.">Ezekiel 24:13</a> "lewdness" would be better rendered <span class= "ital">abomination.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then set it empty upon the coals</span>, etc. The empty cauldron is, of course, the city bereaved of its inhabitants.

There is, however, in spite of the seemingly terrible hopelessness of the sentence, a gleam of hope, as there had been in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-42.htm">Ezekiel 16:42</a>. When the punishment had done its full work, then Jehovah might cause his fury to rest (Ver. 13). Till then he declares, through the prophet, there will be no mitigation of the punishment. The word has gone forth, and there will be no change of purpose. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 The pot on the fire represented Jerusalem besieged by the Chaldeans: all orders and ranks were within the walls, prepared as a prey for the enemy. They ought to have put away their transgressions, as the scum, which rises by the heat of the fire, is taken from the top of the pot. But they grew worse, and their miseries increased. Jerusalem was to be levelled with the ground. The time appointed for the punishment of wicked men may seem to come slowly, but it will come surely. It is sad to think how many there are, on whom ordinances and providences are all lost.</body></html>
