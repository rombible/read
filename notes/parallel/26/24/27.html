They have been hitherto occupied almost exclusively with reproofs for sin and with warnings of impending judgment upon his people. The following prophecies, as far as Ezekiel 32, are indeed of the same character, but are directed entirely against foreign nations. This collection, as noticed in the Introduction, ? 4, is not arranged chronologically like the rest of the book, but on the plan of putting together the prophecies against each nation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/29-17.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 29:17-21</a> is dated more than sixteen years after the fall of Jerusalem, and Ezekiel 32 about two months after the tidings of that event; all the others which are dated are before, but only a little before, the capture of Jerusalem. Most of those undated seem to be in their chronological place, except that the first of them (Ezekiel 25) was evidently after the fall of Jerusalem.<p>After that great judgment was made known to the prophet, there is a marked change in his utterances, and from that time his general tone is far more cheering and consolatory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 Though mourning for the dead is a duty, yet it must be kept under by religion and right reason: we must not sorrow as men that have no hope. Believers must not copy the language and expressions of those who know not God. The people asked the meaning of the sign. God takes from them all that was dearest to them. And as Ezekiel wept not for his affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs. Blessed be God, we need not pine away under our afflictions; for should all comforts fail, and all sorrows be united, yet the broken heart and the mourner's prayer are always acceptable before God.</body></html>
