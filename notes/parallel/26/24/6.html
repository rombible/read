Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.">Ezekiel 24:6-14</a>), but in such wise that the literal and the figurative continually run together. A new feature, that of the rust on the cauldron, is also introduced. A somewhat similar figure may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-4.htm" title="When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the middle thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.">Isaiah 4:4</a>, but with the difference that Ezekiel, as usual, goes much more into minute details.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Scum.</span>--This word, which occurs five times in these verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-6.htm" title="Why thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.">Ezekiel 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/24-11.htm" title="Then set it empty on the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.">Ezekiel 24:11-12</a>), is found nowhere else. Interpreters are agreed in the correctness of the old Greek version of it, <span class= "ital">rust. </span>The thought is, that not only the inhabitants of the city are wicked, but that this wickedness is so great that the city itself (represented by the cauldron) is, as it were, corroded with rust. It is therefore to be utterly destroyed, "brought out piece by piece" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm" title="And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.">2Kings 25:10</a>); no lot is to fall upon it to make a discrimination, since nothing is to be spared. All previous judgments had been partial; this is to be complete.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Scum</span>. The word is not found elsewhere. The Authorized Version follows the Vulgate. Keil and the Revised Version give "rust." As the cauldron was of brass (Ver. 11), this must have been the verdigris which was eating into the metal, and which even the blazing fire could not get rid cf. The pieces that are to be brought out are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are to be carried into exile. There was to be "no lot cast," as was often done with prisoners of war, taking every tenth man (decimating) of the captives for death or exile (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). All alike were doomed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 The pot on the fire represented Jerusalem besieged by the Chaldeans: all orders and ranks were within the walls, prepared as a prey for the enemy. They ought to have put away their transgressions, as the scum, which rises by the heat of the fire, is taken from the top of the pot. But they grew worse, and their miseries increased. Jerusalem was to be levelled with the ground. The time appointed for the punishment of wicked men may seem to come slowly, but it will come surely. It is sad to think how many there are, on whom ordinances and providences are all lost.</body></html>
