It was doubtless the day on which the investment of the city was completed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the ninth year</span>. We pass from the date of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ezekiel 20:1</a> ( <span class="date">B.C. 593</span>) to <span class="date">B.C. 590</span>, and the very day is identified with that on which the army of Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-12</a>). To the prophet's vision all that was passing there was as plain as though he saw it with his own eyes. The siege lasted for about two years. The punishments threatened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>, had at last come near. We may probably infer that a considerable interval of silence had followed on the Aholah and Aholibah discourse. Now the time had come to break that silence, and it was broken, after the prophet's manner, by a parable. In the "rebellious house" we find, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3</a> and elsewhere, primarily Ezekiel's immediate hearers, secondarily the whole house of Israel as represented by them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 The pot on the fire represented Jerusalem besieged by the Chaldeans: all orders and ranks were within the walls, prepared as a prey for the enemy. They ought to have put away their transgressions, as the scum, which rises by the heat of the fire, is taken from the top of the pot. But they grew worse, and their miseries increased. Jerusalem was to be levelled with the ground. The time appointed for the punishment of wicked men may seem to come slowly, but it will come surely. It is sad to think how many there are, on whom ordinances and providences are all lost.</body></html>
