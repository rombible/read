It was in the confidence that God would protect this that the last hope of the Jews lay; He tells them that He will Himself profane it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The desire of your eyes</span>. There is something exquisitely pathetic in the iteration of the phrase of Ver. 17. To the priest Ezekiel himself, to the people whom he <span class="accented">addressed</span>, the temple was as dear as the wife to the husband. It was also "the pride of their power" (Revised Version), the "pity of their soul" (margin). The former phrase comes from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>. When that temple should be profaned, when sons and daughters should fall by the sword, then they would do as the prophet had done. They would learn that there is a sorrow which is too deep for tears, something that passeth show. The state which the prophet describes is not one of callousness, or impenitence, or despair. The people shall mourn for their <span class="accented">iniquities</span>;" <span class="accented">this</span> will be the beginning of repentance. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39, 40</a> was obviously in the prophet's thoughts. We note that Ver. 24 is the one solitary passage since <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a> in which Ezekiel names himself. As single acts and gestures had before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-12</a>) been a sign of what was coming, so now the man himself was to be in that hour of bereavement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 Though mourning for the dead is a duty, yet it must be kept under by religion and right reason: we must not sorrow as men that have no hope. Believers must not copy the language and expressions of those who know not God. The people asked the meaning of the sign. God takes from them all that was dearest to them. And as Ezekiel wept not for his affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs. Blessed be God, we need not pine away under our afflictions; for should all comforts fail, and all sorrows be united, yet the broken heart and the mourner's prayer are always acceptable before God.</body></html>
