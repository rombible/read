For the present there was to be the silence of unutterable sorrow, continuing, day after day, as there had been before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a>). Then there should come a messenger from Jerusalem, reporting its capture and destruction, and then his mouth should be opened. The messenger does not come till nearly three years afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>); and we must infer that there was no spoken message during the interval, but that from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-1.htm">Ezekiel 25:1</a> onward we have the written words of the Lord that came to him from time to time, not as messages to Israel, but as bearing on the fate of the surrounding nations.

Believers must not copy the language and expressions of those who know not God. The people asked the meaning of the sign. God takes from them all that was dearest to them. And as Ezekiel wept not for his affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs. Blessed be God, we need not pine away under our afflictions; for should all comforts fail, and all sorrows be united, yet the broken heart and the mourner's prayer are always acceptable before God.</body></html>
