but all the more should it press upon them inwardly, and, according to the terrible threatening of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm" title="And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.">Leviticus 26:39</a>, they should "pine away in their iniquity" in their enemies' land. In the original the preposition is the same here as in Leviticus, "<span class= "ital">in </span>your iniquity."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 Though mourning for the dead is a duty, yet it must be kept under by religion and right reason: we must not sorrow as men that have no hope. Believers must not copy the language and expressions of those who know not God. The people asked the meaning of the sign. God takes from them all that was dearest to them. And as Ezekiel wept not for his affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs. Blessed be God, we need not pine away under our afflictions; for should all comforts fail, and all sorrows be united, yet the broken heart and the mourner's prayer are always acceptable before God.</body></html>
