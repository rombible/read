but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.">Ezekiel 24:23</a>), or the special "mitre of fine linen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-28.htm" title="And a turban of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,">Exodus 39:28</a>) provided for the priests; but as the peculiar priestly garments were worn only when the priests were on duty within the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/6-10.htm" title="And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.">Leviticus 6:10-11</a>), it is not likely that Ezekiel used them in his captivity. The priests were expressly allowed to mourn for their nearest relations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/21-2.htm" title="But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.">Leviticus 21:2-3</a>), and Ezekiel is therefore here made an exception. Among the ordinary signs of mourning was the covering of the head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm" title="And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.">2Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-3.htm" title="And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.">Jeremiah 14:3</a>), the sprinkling of dust upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-30.htm" title="And shall cause their voice to be heard against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust on their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:">Ezekiel 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm" title="And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth on his head.">1Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-32.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth on his head:">2Samuel 15:32</a>), going barefoot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-30.htm" title="Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.">1Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot.

All these things are now forbidden to the prophet in his sorrow.<p><span class= "bld">Eat not the bread of men</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the bread furnished by other men. It was customary for friends and neighbours to send food to the house of mourning, a custom which seems to be alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-14.htm" title="I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have listened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that you have commanded me.">Deuteronomy 26:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm" title="Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.">Jeremiah 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-4.htm" title="They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.">Hosea 9:4</a>; and out of this custom the habit of funeral feasts appears to have grown in later times.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 Though mourning for the dead is a duty, yet it must be kept under by religion and right reason: we must not sorrow as men that have no hope. Believers must not copy the language and expressions of those who know not God. The people asked the meaning of the sign. God takes from them all that was dearest to them. And as Ezekiel wept not for his affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs. Blessed be God, we need not pine away under our afflictions; for should all comforts fail, and all sorrows be united, yet the broken heart and the mourner's prayer are always acceptable before God.</body></html>
