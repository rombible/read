In this verse the sense of the word translated "spice" is doubtful. If this be its true meaning, the idea must be, Go on thoroughly with the cooking; but the word is always used in connection with the preparation of compound incense or spices, and seems therefore to refer to the thoroughness of the work, and thus to mean, Boil thoroughly. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-31.htm" title="He makes the deep to boil like a pot: he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.">Job 41:31</a> (Heb. 23) its derivative is used as a simile for the raging sea.

They ought to have put away their transgressions, as the scum, which rises by the heat of the fire, is taken from the top of the pot. But they grew worse, and their miseries increased. Jerusalem was to be levelled with the ground. The time appointed for the punishment of wicked men may seem to come slowly, but it will come surely. It is sad to think how many there are, on whom ordinances and providences are all lost.</body></html>
