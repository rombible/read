Bath-sheba's entrance into the bedchamber seems to be looked upon as an intrusion, to be ventured upon only in the humble attitude of a suppliant. Nathan does not presume to approach the king with remonstrance, till the maternal anxiety of Bath-sheba has paved the way. (Comp, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/esther/4-10.htm" title="Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment to Mordecai;">Esther 4:10-16</a>, the picture of the still more unapproachable royalty of Persia.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, while thou yet talkest there</span> [the original is more graphic, "thou art yet talking... and I"] <span class="cmt_word">with the king, I also win come after thee and confirm</span> [marg., "fill up," cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, LXX.

Let me give thee counsel how to save thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.</body></html>
