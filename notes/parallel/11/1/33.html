See ver. 43; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-11.htm">2 Samuel 11:11</a>, and 2 Sam 20:6. Note: The latter passage, which refers to the <span class="accented">king, has</span> the plur.; the former, referring to Joab, the sing.] <span class="cmt_word">and cause</span> <span class="cmt_word">Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule,</span> [lit., "the she mule" (the most prized in the East. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>, Hebrews) "which is mine." This was not merely a mark of honour (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8, 9</a>), but a public and very significant indication of David's will respecting his successor. The populace would perceive at once who was destined to sit in David's seat. "The Rabbins tell us that it was death to ride on the king's mule without his permission" (Rawlinson). <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, the fem. form is only found here and in vers. 38, 44. The mule would seem to have been a recent importation into Palestine - we never read of them before the time of David - and the Israelites were forbidden to breed them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>). Their use, consequently, was naturally restricted to royal or distinguished personages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>). Wordsworth sees in the word a proof that David had not disobeyed God by multiplying <span class="accented">horses</span> to himself], <span class="cmt_word">and bring him down to Gihon.</span> [Not Gibeon, which Thenius most arbitrarily would substitute for the received text. Where was Gihon? The popular belief (accepted by Bahr and Keil, as well as by some geographers) is that it was in the valley of the Son of Hinnom, a part of which still bears the name of Gihon, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to the west of Jerusalem, and not far from the Jaffa gate. By many indeed the present <span class="accented">Birket-es-Sultan</span> is identified with the Lower Pool of Gihon. But others (Ferguson, Rawlinson, etc.) see in it the ancient name of the Tyropaeon. Scripture does not speak of it as a <span class="accented">spring</span>, though the "source of the waters of Gihon" is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>, Hebrews The text shows that it was <span class="accented">below</span> the city ("bring him <span class="accented">down</span> upon Gihon," ver. 33. Cf. also ver. 40). <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>, speaks of "Gihon in the valley," where it is very noticeable that the word used is <span class="accented">Nachal</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Wady, watercourse). But this "is the word always employed for the valley of the Kedron, east of Jerusalem, the so called valley of Jehoshaphat; <span class="accented">ge</span> (ravine or glen) being as constantly employed for the valley of Hinnom, south and west of the town" (Grove," Dict. Bible," art. Gihon). It is also to be noticed that the text last cited mentions Gihon in connection with Ophel, which lies southeast of Jerusalem.. The Chald., Arab., and Syr. are probably right, therefore, in identifying Gihon here with <span class="accented">Siloam</span> (which lies at the foot of Ophel), in favour of which it may further be said that it would be admirably suited for David's purpose - of a counter demonstration - and that whether En-Rogel is to be found at the Well of the Virgin or the Well of Job. Siloam is at no great distance from either, and quite within earshot, whereas the traditional Gihon is altogether out of the way. It must be borne in mind that this procession to and from Gihon was ordained, not because there was any special reason for anointing Solomon there ? for it was not a holy place - but purely as a demonstration to the populace, and to checkmate the conspirators. It was probably a public place, and would accommodate a large concourse (Poole). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:32-53 The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation of Solomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.</body></html>
