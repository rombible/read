If there is an appearance of artifice, there was no intention to deceive. And the artifice, such as it was, was not only harmless, but for the public good. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet</span> [we are scarcely justified in seeing in this "solemn announcement of his approach" an "indication of the consideration in which he was held" (Stanley). It is difficult to see how otherwise he could be announced. It is clear that he was constantly spoken of as "the prophet" (vers. 10, 22, 34, 38, etc. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>]. <span class="cmt_word">And when he was come in before</span> [Hebrews <span class="accented">and he came before</span> - three words instead of six] <span class="cmt_word">the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground</span> [see on vers. 16, 20; and cf. ver. 31, where we have a similar expression. "In the Assyrian sculptures, ambassadors are represented with their faces actually touching the earth before the feet of the monarch" (Rawlinson). This profound reverence on the part of Nathan is the more remarkable, when we remember how he had once denounced David to his face (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a>)]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11-31 Observe Nathan's address to Bathsheba. Let me give thee counsel how to save thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.</body></html>
