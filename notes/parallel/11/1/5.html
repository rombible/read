and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;">2Samuel 3:4</a>), at least thirty-three years before. From the words of Solomon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-22.htm" title="And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.">1Kings 2:22</a>, we may gather that he claimed the throne as being now the eldest son. Hence it is probable that Chileab (or Daniel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Now these were the sons of David, which were born to him in Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:">1Chronicles 3:1</a>), the second son, was dead, as well as Amnon and Absalom. The similarity between Adonijah and Absalom, in respect of personal beauty, favour with a too-indulgent father, ambition and trust in popularity, is evidently suggested by the narrative, which places them in close connection, although born of different mothers. The means, moreover, which Adonijah employed, the body-guard of fifty men, and the maintenance of "chariots and horsemen," are exactly imitated from the example of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.">2Samuel 15:1</a>); and we note that the festal sacrifice, with the support of two important leaders in peace and war, recalls the same model. But Adonijah hardly shows the craft and ruthless determination of the elder rebel. His attempt on the crown seems crude and ill-planned in conception, and wanting in promptitude of action.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Adonijah</span> [ = "Jehovah is my Lord."

For Amnon's death, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>; for Absalom's, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>.

It is true there was no "right of primogeniture" in the Hebrew monarchy. "The God King had reserved to Himself the choice of the earthly king" (Keil). David himself was not the eldest, but the youngest brother. At the same time primogeniture, <span class="accented">ceteris paribus</span>, would have, and as a matter of fact had, considerable weight. The firstborn had the birthright; can we doubt he would expect the crown, and think it hard if he were passed over?

Adonijah seems in every way to have imitated Absalom. Josephus says he resembled him in disposition. Chariots, horses, and outrunners are mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>) as the very first of the king's insigina. Horses were such natural and familiar tokens of royal state (not being employed in agriculture or for travelling), that the Hebrew kings were warned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>) against multiplying them. Outrunners again, such as the Roman emperors had (called by them <span class="accented">cursores</span>), and such as we find at the present day in Egypt, <span class="accented">footmen</span> who precede the chariot at full speed, and by their shrill cries clear the way, are admirably calculated to impress the public mind. According to Morier, "runners before the king's horse in Persia are indispensable to the royal state." Adonijah hoped by this display of regal pomp to win the suffrages of the people.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Indulgent parents are often chastised with disobedient children, who are anxious to possess their estates. No worldly wisdom, nor experience, nor sacredness of character, can insure the continuance in any former course of those who remain under the power of self-love. But we may well wonder by what arts Joab and Abiathar could be drawn aside.</body></html>
