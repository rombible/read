In the whole chapter he appears rather as a chief officer and counsellor of David, than in the loftier aspect of the prophetic character.

These, however, being older than David, would now be in extreme old age. Of Rei, we have no mention elsewhere; but there is a Shimei (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-18.htm" title="Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:">1Kings 4:18</a>), a high officer of Solomon; a "Shimea," brother of Solomon (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5</a>), and a "Shammah," one of the "mighty men" (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm" title="And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.">2Samuel 23:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The mighty men</span>.--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/23-8.htm" title="These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.">2Samuel 23:8-39</a>. The name <span class= "ital">Gibborim</span> is a technical name, and is thought to designate a picked body of troops, the standing nucleus of the armies of Israel. It is commonly inferred that they were the successors of the six hundred men of David's band during his life of wandering and exile, and that "the three" and "the thirty" (2 Samuel 23) were their officers. They are mentioned as attached to the person of David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-7.htm" title="And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.">2Samuel 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/16-6.htm" title="And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.">2Samuel 16:6, 2Sa_20:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Zadok the priest</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>. It is generally said to be difficult to explain "how Zadok and Abiathar came both to be "priests at this time." Rawlinson, who adds that "the best explanation is that Abiathar was the real high priest," officiating in Zion, while Zadok acted as chief priest at the tabernacle at Gibeon. (Bahr, by a strange oversight, assigns to Zadok the care of the ark on Mount Zion, whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>, distinctly connects his ministry with the tabernacle of witness at Gibeon.) But the precedence (see on ver. 7) generally assigned to Zadok is hardly consistent with the idea that Abiathar was "the real high priest." The fact is that a duality of high priests, associated, apparently, on pretty equal terms, was not unknown in Jewish history. The cases of Eleazer and Ithamar, Hophni and Phinehas, Annas and Caiaphas, will occur to all. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, speaks of "the chief priest" and "the second priest;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm">2 Chronicles 31:10</a>, of the "chief priest of the house of Zadok." And a dual priesthood would be the more necessary in David's days, because of the two sanctuaries, Zion and Gibeon. We find, however, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>, that Zadok was already priest at the time of the bringing up of the ark. And the true explanation, no doubt, is that Zadok had succeeded some member of his family, in all probability Jehoiada, called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>, "the leader of Aaron" (Hebrews), who had certainly been high priest in the time of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>), and who would hardly be degraded when, with 3700 followers, he joined David at Hebron. On his decease, or cession of orifice, Zadok, who had joined at the same time with a large contingent,was associated with Abiathar in the priest's office. This dual arrangement, consequently, was the result of David's having taken over a high priest from Saul, together with the kingdom, when he had Abiathar as priest already,] <span class="cmt_word">and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Jehoiada the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>). Benaiah was consequently a Levite, and of the family of Aaron; set, however, by David, because of his prowess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>) over the bodyguard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>).
