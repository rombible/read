not lending any emphasis ( = <span class="accented">immo</span>), as Keil says the first and third <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;</span> of this verse do, but in English simply redundant. See on vers. 13, 17] <span class="cmt_word">Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne</span> [same words as in vers. 13, 17, 24. These close repetitions are the habit of the East] <span class="cmt_word">in my stead, even so</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">that so</span>] <span class="cmt_word">will I</span> (<span class="cmt_word">certainly</span> [not in Hebrews] <span class="cmt_word">do this day.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11-31 Observe Nathan's address to Bathsheba. Let me give thee counsel how to save thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.</body></html>
