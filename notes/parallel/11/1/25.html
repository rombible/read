There appears to be an undertone of reproof in these words.

Bahr's accidental miscitation (ver. 10 for ver. 9) has apparently led his American translator (p. 24) to the serious mistake of identifying these "captains of the host" with "the mighty men" (Gibborim) of ver. 10, who, it is distinctly said, "were not with Adonijah] <span class="cmt_word">and Abtathar the priest, and behold, they eat and drink before him</span> [<span class="accented">convivia apta conjurationibus.</span> Grotius] <span class="cmt_word">and say, God save king Adonijah.</span> [Hebrews "let the king (not "king," as marg.)
