The intentions and promises (ver. 13) of his father can hardly have been unknown to him. The name "Jedidiah, too, bestowed upon Solomon by Nathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>), taken in connexion with the prophecy of Nathan (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 2 Samuel 7:12; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9, 10</a>), must have proved to him that Solomon was marked out for David's successor. He seems to have been well aware also who were Solomon's supporters. To some of them he may have made indirect overtures. The historian having recorded Adonijah's preparations for a <span class="accented">coup d'etat</span>, now relates the manner in which the plot was frustrated. The prophet, who had been the guardian and preceptor of Solomon's youth, and who knew the Divine will respecting the succession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9, 10</a>), takes prompt and energetic measures to defeat the conspiracy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Indulgent parents are often chastised with disobedient children, who are anxious to possess their estates. No worldly wisdom, nor experience, nor sacredness of character, can insure the continuance in any former course of those who remain under the power of self-love. But we may well wonder by what arts Joab and Abiathar could be drawn aside.</body></html>
