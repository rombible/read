We have Scripture instances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-7.htm">2 Kings 10:7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-21.htm">1 Samuel 24:21</a>). To put a royal <span class="accented">mother</span> to death, along with her offspring, though perhaps unusual, was not unknown. Rawlinson cites the instances of Cleopatra, widow of Philip of Macedon, who was murdered with her infant son Caranus by Olympias; and Roxana, widow of Alexander the Great, who, with her son, was put to death by Cassander. Nathan does not say this will be, but may be, Bathsheba's fate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11-31 Observe Nathan's address to Bathsheba. Let me give thee counsel how to save thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.</body></html>
