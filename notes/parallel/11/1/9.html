The derivation seems to be from a root, meaning to "crawl," or "steal on."

It was a sacrificial feast, like Absalom's, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a> (where see Speaker's note).

Perhaps "the spring of the spy." The Chald., Arab., and Syr. render "the spring, of the fuller" - the Orientals wash clothes, etc., by <span class="accented">treading</span> (rogel) them. Josephus says it was without the city, in the royal garden (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1ff3;</span>). The authorities are divided between the "Fountain of the virgin" (Ain um ed-Deraj), and the "Well of Job" (Bir Eyub.) See the arguments in Bonar's "Land of Promise," App. 5; Thomson's "Land and Book," vol. 2 p. 528; and Mr. Grove's Art. in Smith's "Dict. Bib." Porter ("Handbook of Palestine ") identifies En-Rogel with Bir Eyub without remark. There is much to be said on either side. The pool of Siloam ("Bib.

The fierce jealousy between Ephraim and Judah would almost compel the king to surround himself with soldiers and attendants of the latter tribe. Some of the invited guests, no doubt, like Absalom's two hundred, "went in their simplicity and knew not anything" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-11.htm">2 Samuel 15:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Indulgent parents are often chastised with disobedient children, who are anxious to possess their estates. No worldly wisdom, nor experience, nor sacredness of character, can insure the continuance in any former course of those who remain under the power of self-love. But we may well wonder by what arts Joab and Abiathar could be drawn aside.</body></html>
