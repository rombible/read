Probably, as in the appointment of Saul and David himself, the right to anoint was recognised as belonging to the prophetic order (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1Kings 19:16</a>), inasmuch as it signified the outpouring of the Holy Spirit of the Lord. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>.) Hence, in the absence of Nathan, it could not be attempted. In the case of David, such anointing had marked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward.

The "riding on the King's mule," attended by the body-guard, marked the royal sanction; the anointing, the sanction of priest and prophet; and the acclamation the adhesion of the people. Then are to follow the enthronement and homage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet</span> [Bahr sees in the fact that Nathan was associated with Zadok in the anointing, "the high significance David attributed to the prophetic office in Israel" But the prophets constantly performed this ceremony. Samuel anointed both Saul and David; Elisha anointed Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1</a>), and was commissioned to anoint Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15, 16</a>) ] anoint him [the king, being a sacred personage, was set apart to the office, like the priest and prophet, by anointing. Saul was probably anointed twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>. Cf. 12:3). David was anointed thrice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>. Solomon was anointed twice (ver. 39; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). The Rabbins have always held that subsequent kings were not anointed, where the succession was regular. But this opinion must be taken <span class="accented">quantum valet.</span> It is true that we only <span class="accented">read</span> of the anointing of Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6</a>), Joash (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 2 Kings 11:12), and Jehoahaz (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 2 Kings 23:30), and that in these three cases the accession was irregular. But it is obvious that other kings may have been anointed as well, though the fact is not recorded. There would be no reason for recording it in ordinary cases It seems hardly likely, too, that any king would readily dispense with an ordinance which would so much strengthen his title] <span class="cmt_word">there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet</span> [the sound of the trumpet would almost seem to have been a necessary accompaniment of coronations, or the proclamation of a new king.

Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.</body></html>
