This is another indication that the royal power had been greatly consolidated during the last peaceful years of David's reign. Perhaps, moreover, the usurpation of Adonijah, not being viewed as a rebellion against David, but only a presumption on his favour, was accordingly crushed at once by the expression of his will. It is strange that of all the conspirators Adonijah alone seems to have feared punishment at this time; his accomplices, the other conspirators, are apparently allowed to disperse in safety, and their rebellion is ignored.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the guests</span> [Hebrews <span class="accented">called</span>, LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">that were with</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Adonijah were afraid</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">trembled</span>] <span class="cmt_word">and rose up</span> [LXX. omits] <span class="cmt_word">and went every man his way.</span> [This fear and flight betray a consciousness of guilt.

Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.</body></html>
