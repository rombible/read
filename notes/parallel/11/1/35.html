In the case of David himself, it may be observed that the record of his accession to royalty over Israel contains the notice of "a league" made by him with the elders of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm" title="So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.">2Samuel 5:3</a>), to which there is nothing to correspond in the account of his becoming king over Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm" title="And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.">2Samuel 2:4</a>). This perhaps indicates from the beginning a less absolute rule over the other tribes. Certainly the history of the rebellion of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-10.htm" title="But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.">2Samuel 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-13.htm" title="And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.">2Samuel 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/18-6.htm" title="So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;">2Samuel 18:6-7</a>), the disputes about the restoration of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/19-41.htm" title="And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?">2Samuel 19:41-43</a>), and the attempt of Sheba to take advantage of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1-2</a>), show a looser allegiance of Israel than of Judah to the house of David.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then ye shall come up</span> (after him [not in the LXX.

It is more probable, however, that "Israel and Judah" was even then the current designation of the two component parts of the realm (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11, 41</a>, etc.). Besides, we can hardly suppose that the historian has in every case, though he probably has in this, preserved the exact words of the speaker; and it need cause us no surprise had he put into David's mouth the phraseology of a later age. In the nature of things he can only give us the <span class="accented">substance</span> of conversations such as these. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:32-53 The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation of Solomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.</body></html>
