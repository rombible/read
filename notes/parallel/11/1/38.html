But while their functions are pretty well understood, great difference of opinion exists as to the origin or meaning of the words. By some they are supposed to be <span class="accented">Gentile</span> names. A tribe of Cherethites is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>), and in close connexion with the Philistines (ver. 16). Hence Cherethite has been thought to be another name for Philistine; and as the LXX. and Syr. render the word "Cretans," it has been conjectured that the Philistines had their origin from Crete. They did come from Caphtor, and that is probably Crete (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> again, is not unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> In favor of this view is the fact that David certainly had a bodyguard of foreign mercenaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>, where the "Gittites" are connected with the Cherethites). Nor does it make against it that "two designations" would thus "be employed side by side for one and the same people" - as if we should speak of Britons and Englishmen (Bahr). For the names look like a <span class="accented">paronomasia</span> - of which the Jews were very fond - and a trick of this kind would at once account for the tautology. [Since writing this, I find the same idea has already occurred to Ewald.] But the other view, adopted by Gesenius, is that the names are names of office and function. Cherethite he would derive from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5db;</span>, cut, slay; and by Cherethites he would understand "executioners," which the royal bodyguard were in ancient despotisms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1, Hebrews</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-14.htm">Daniel 2:14</a>, etc. See on 1 Kings 2:25). In the Pelethites (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, swiftness) he would see the public couriers (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) of Eastern men. archies (see Herod. 8:98 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-6.htm">2 Chronicles 30:6</a>). We see the guard discharging the function first named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4, 8</a>; and the latter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a> (marg.)] <span class="cmt_word">went down</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the palace on Mount Zion] <span class="cmt_word">and caused Solomon to ride upon King David's mule, and brought him to</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>: cf. 2:26] <span class="cmt_word">Gihon</span> [Chald., Syr., Arab., <span class="accented">Shiloha</span>]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:32-53 The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation of Solomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.</body></html>
