He then allied himself with the royal house of Tyre, probably both for strength against Syria, and for revival of the commercial prosperity of the days of Solomon, and proceeded to found a new capital in a strong position. That he was a warrior is indicated by the phrase, "the might that he shewed." Probably, like Jeroboam and Baasha, he also had his opportunity of restoring the spiritual strength of his people by returning to the pure worship of God, and threw it away, doing "worse than all who were before him."<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the thirty and first year of Asa, king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years</span> [As Omri was proclaimed king in the twenty-seventh and died in the thirty-eighth year of Asa (cf. vers. 15, 29), he cannot in any case have reigned twelve <span class="accented">full</span> years; whereas if his reign is to be dated, as it is here, from the thirty-first year of Asa, it is obvious that he would only have reigned seven, or, according to the Jewish mode of reckoning, eight years. Rawlinson proposes to get over the difficulty by rearranging the text. He would attach the first clause of this verse to ver. 22, and read, "And Omri reigned in the thirty-first," etc. But to this there are two serious objections. First, that ver. 23, as it now stands, only follows the usual formula with which a new reign is announced (cf. vers. 8, 15, 29); and, second, it is extremely doubtful whether any prose sentence in the Hebrew ever begins as ver. 23 would then do, "<span class="accented">Reigned</span> <span class="accented">Omri</span> over Israel twelve years." Such a sentence would certainly be quite alien to the <span class="accented">usus</span> <span class="accented">loquendi</span> of our author. We are therefore reduced to the conclusion either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the text here, as in some other instances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>; cf. 3:1; 13:1, 10, etc.), has suffered at the hands of a reviser, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the numbers have been corrupted in transcription; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the historian expresses himself in a somewhat confused way. Of these suppositions perhaps <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is the most likely. Anyhow, it is clear that the twelve years of Omri's reign are to be counted not from the thirty-first, but from the twenty-seventh year of Asa, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the date of Zimri's death (see vers. 10, 15, 29). The confusion has arisen from the fact that it was not until Tibni was slain, after four years of conflict, that Omri became <span class="accented">sole</span> ruler]: <span class="cmt_word">six years reigned he in Tirzah.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:15-28 When men forsake God, they will be left to plague one another. Proud aspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years. Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Many wicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, and their names are found in history; but they have no name in the book of life.</body></html>
