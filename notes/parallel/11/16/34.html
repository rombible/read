The place had not, it would appear, been entirely deserted. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-5.htm" title="When they told it to David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.">2Samuel 10:5</a>.) But it was now made--what it continued to be even down to the time of Herod--an important place. Its natural advantages were great. It stood in a position well watered, and accordingly of great beauty and fruitfulness ("the city of palm trees"), and was, moreover, a city of military consequence, as commanding the pass from the valley of the Jordan to the high ground of Ai and Bethel. Having been assigned to Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm" title="Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,">Joshua 18:21</a>), it should have properly belonged to the kingdom of Judah. Its being rebuilt by a Bethelite, evidently under the patronage of Ahab, is one of the indications of a half-dependent condition of the Southern kingdom at this time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In his days did Hiel the Bethelite</span> [Observe the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, and see note on 1 Kings 2:8.

It is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-5.htm">2 Samuel 10:5</a> that it had not been entirely uninhabited.

It had evidently passed, however, at this date into the possession of Israel. It has been suggested that the transference took place in the reign of Baasha (Rawlinson). But it would seem that from the very first, parts of Benjamin (notably Bethel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>) belonged to the northern kingdom. See Ewald, "Hist. Israel," 4:2, 3. It is not quite clear whether the rebuilding of Jericho is mentioned as a proof of the daring impiety of that age and of the utter contempt with which the warnings of the law were treated, or as showing the ignorance and consequent disregard of law which prevailed. But, on the whole, it seems to be implied that Hiel knew of the threatening of Joshua, and treated it with defiance. It has been suggested that the rebuilding had really been instigated by Ahab, and for his own purposes, hoping thereby to "secure to himself the passage across the Jordan" (Keil), but the text affords but slight warrant for this conjecture]: <span class="cmt_word">he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at the cost of, in the life of, Abiram], <span class="cmt_word">and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>], <span class="cmt_word">which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.</span> [The exact fulfilment of the prophecy is mentioned, as showing that even in those dark and troublous times God did not leave Himself without witness, and that law could never be violated with impunity.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:29-34 Ahab did evil above all that reigned before him, and did it with a particular enmity both against Jehovah and Israel. He was not satisfied with breaking the second commandment by image-worship, he broke the first by worshipping other gods: making light of lesser sins makes way for greater. Marriages with daring offenders also imbolden in wickedness, and hurry men on to the greatest excesses. One of Ahab's subjects, following the example of his presumption, ventured to build Jericho. Like Achan, he meddled with the accursed thing; turned that to his own use, which was devoted to God's honour: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well devoted to God's honour: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well known in Israel; but none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. Let the reading of this chapter cause us to mark the dreadful end of all the workers of iniquity. And what does the history of all ungodly men furnish, what ever rank or situation they move in, but sad examples of the same?</body></html>
