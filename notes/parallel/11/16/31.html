He is said to have assassinated Pheles, king of Tyre, within fifty years after the death of Hiram, and to have founded a new dynasty. He was a priest of Astarte, and it is notable that he is called, not, like Hiram, "king of Tyre," but "king of the Sidonians," thus reviving the older name of "the great Zidon," which had been superseded by Tyre. His priestly origin, and possibly also this revival of the old ideas and spirit of the Ph?nician race, may account for the fanatic devotion to Baal visible in Jezebel and Athaliah, which stands in marked contrast with the religious attitude of Hiram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which has given to David a wise son over this great people.">1Kings 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm" title="Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.">2Chronicles 2:12</a>). The marriage of Ahab with Jezebel was evidently the fatal turning-point in the life of a man physically brave, and possibly able as a ruler, but morally weak, impressible in turn both by good and by evil. The history shows again and again the contrast of character (which it is obvious to compare with the contrast between Shakespeare's Macbeth and Lady Macbeth), and the almost complete supremacy of the strong relentless nature of Jezebel.<p>2. The Baal here referred to is, of course, the Zidonian god, worshipped as the productive principle in nature, in conjunction with Astarte, the female or receptive principle. The name itself only signifies "Lord" (in which sense, indeed, it is applied, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-16.htm" title="And it shall be at that day, said the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.">Hosea 2:16</a>, to Jehovah Himself), and is marked as being a mere title, by the almost invariable prefix of the article. Being, therefore, in no sense distinctive, it may be, and is, applied to the supreme god of various mythologies. Thus we find that in Scripture the plural Baalim is first used, of "the gods many and lords many" of Canaanitish worship (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:">Judges 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm" title="Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.">1Samuel 7:4</a>); and we have traces of the same vague use in the Baal-peor of Numbers 25, the Baal-berith of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.">Judges 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm" title="And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.">Judges 9:4</a>, the Baal-zebub of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2Kings 1:2-3</a>, and in the various geographical names having the prefix Baal. The worship of the Ph?nician Baal--variously represented, sometimes as the Sun, sometimes as the planet Jupiter, sometimes half-humanised as the "Tyrian Hercules"--was now, however, introduced on a great scale, with profuse magnificence of worship, connected with the Asherah ("grove"), which in this case, no doubt, represented the Ph?nician Astarte, and enforced by Jezebel with a high hand, not without persecution of the prophets of the Lord. The conflict between it and the spiritual worship of Jehovah became now a conflict of life and death.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him</span> [Heb. as marg. <span class="accented">was it a light thing?</span> Ewald (362 <span class="accented">a</span>) explains this to mean "because it was."

In either case the name well became him, for, according to Menander (<span class="accented">apud</span> Jos. <span class="accented">l.c.</span>), he was <span class="accented">the</span> priest of Astarte, who gained for himself the throne of the Zidonians by the assassination of Pheles. He is further said to have reigned thirty-two years, and to have lived sixty-eight years. He would therefore be thirty-six years old at the time of his accession. It does not appear that (Keil) he was the brother of Pheles. Pheles, however, was certainly a fratricide. (Rawlinson reminds us that Jezebel was great-aunt to Pygmalion and Dido.) This statement helps to explain Jezebel's fierce and sanguinary character, and at the same time accounts for her great devotion to the gods of her country, and for her determined efforts to establish their impure rites in her husband's kingdom. It was only what one would expect from the child of such a parent] <span class="cmt_word">king of the Zidonians</span> [This alliance, it is extremely probable, was made for purely political reasons, as a counterpoise against the active, ambitious, and encroaching power which had arisen in Damascene Syria.

We are also familiar with the word in the names Hanni<span class="accented">bal</span>, Hasdru<span class="accented">bal</span>, etc. Baal was the supreme male god of the Canaanitish races, as Ashtoreth was their great female divinity.

He was not satisfied with breaking the second commandment by image-worship, he broke the first by worshipping other gods: making light of lesser sins makes way for greater. Marriages with daring offenders also imbolden in wickedness, and hurry men on to the greatest excesses. One of Ahab's subjects, following the example of his presumption, ventured to build Jericho. Like Achan, he meddled with the accursed thing; turned that to his own use, which was devoted to God's honour: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well devoted to God's honour: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well known in Israel; but none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. Let the reading of this chapter cause us to mark the dreadful end of all the workers of iniquity. And what does the history of all ungodly men furnish, what ever rank or situation they move in, but sad examples of the same?</body></html>
