Not only had he occupied a subordinate position, but his murder of all Elah's friends must have made him a host of enemies in the camp. It was the natural thing for them, therefore, to turn to Omri. He had the advantage of being in possession. The captain of the host stood next to the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-13.htm">2 Kings 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm">2 Samuel 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a>), and twice stepped into his place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-5.htm">2 Kings 9:5</a>).

Proud aspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years. Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Many wicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, and their names are found in history; but they have no name in the book of life.</body></html>
