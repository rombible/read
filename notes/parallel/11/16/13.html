their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.">Isaiah 41:29</a>; Jer. viii 19; &c.): not only the idols of Dan and Bethel, but the worse abominations which grew up under cover of these. In the Old Testament generally the contempt for idolatry and false worship as a gross folly, wasting faith on unrealities, is at least as strong as the condemnation of them, as outraging God's law, and connected with sensual or bloody rites. (See, for example, the utter scorn of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/115-4.htm" title="Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.">Psalm 115:4-8</a>.)<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> corresponds with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> of ver. 7 = <span class="accented">propter</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-5.htm">1 Kings 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-22.htm">1 Kings 21:22</a>] <span class="cmt_word">all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger</span> [the formula of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-30.htm">1 Kings 15:30</a>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">with their vanities.</span> [The calves, not idols, are referred to here.

God calls Israel his people still, though wretchedly corrupted. Jehu foretells the same destruction to come upon Baasha's family, which that king had been employed to bring upon the family of Jeroboam. Those who resemble others in their sins, may expect to resemble them in the plagues they suffer, especially those who seem zealous against such sins in others as they allow in themselves. Baasha himself dies in peace, and is buried with honour. Herein plainly appears that there are punishments after death, which are most to be dreaded. Let Elah be a warning to drunkards, who know not but death may surprise them. Death easily comes upon men when they are drunk. Besides the diseases which men bring themselves into by drinking, when in that state, men are easily overcome by an enemy, and liable to bad accidents. Death comes terribly upon men in such a state, finding them in the act of sin, and unfitted for any act of devotion; that day comes upon them unawares. The word of God was fulfilled, and the sins of Baasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God. Their idols are called their vanities, for idols cannot profit nor help; miserable are those whose gods are vanities.</body></html>
