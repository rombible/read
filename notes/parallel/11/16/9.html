On the other hand, Zimri--noted emphatically as "his servant"--was apparently the high officer left in special charge of the palace and the king's person, while the mass of the army was in the field. Hence his name passed into a proverb for unusual treachery.

[Several points present themselves for notice here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the example of Jeroboam has clearly had its full influence on the nation. "The Lord's anointed "is no longer had in reverence, as in the days of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14</a>), nor is it accounted a sin to grasp at the crown. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Zimri only does what Baasha had done before him.

His place was clearly with his army at Gibbethon (ver. 15; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>. 4). And as clearly it was not in the house of one of his subjects, even the intendant of his palace. "An Oriental monarch... is precluded by etiquette from accepting the hospitality of his subjects" - Rawlinson, who further remarks that the low tastes which we here find Elah indulging" had probably been formed before his father was exalted <span class="accented">out of the dust</span>." As probably they were inherited direct from his father. Anyhow, they led to his destruction. It is clear that Elah's want of character, like Nadab's, suggested the conspiracy of Zimri. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is extremely probable, though not absolutely certain, as Bahr affirms, that Arza was one of the conspirators, and that the wretched prince had been decoyed to his house and made drunk, with a view to his murder there.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 This chapter relates wholly to the kingdom of Israel, and the revolutions of that kingdom. God calls Israel his people still, though wretchedly corrupted. Jehu foretells the same destruction to come upon Baasha's family, which that king had been employed to bring upon the family of Jeroboam. Those who resemble others in their sins, may expect to resemble them in the plagues they suffer, especially those who seem zealous against such sins in others as they allow in themselves. Baasha himself dies in peace, and is buried with honour. Herein plainly appears that there are punishments after death, which are most to be dreaded. Let Elah be a warning to drunkards, who know not but death may surprise them. Death easily comes upon men when they are drunk. Besides the diseases which men bring themselves into by drinking, when in that state, men are easily overcome by an enemy, and liable to bad accidents. Death comes terribly upon men in such a state, finding them in the act of sin, and unfitted for any act of devotion; that day comes upon them unawares. The word of God was fulfilled, and the sins of Baasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God. Their idols are called their vanities, for idols cannot profit nor help; miserable are those whose gods are vanities.</body></html>
