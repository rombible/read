The word here rendered "palace" evidently means (as is clear from its derivation) "the high place," or "citadel," of the building. Some render it the "harem," with which the curious rendering (<span class= "greekheb">??????</span>) of the LXX.--signifying properly a cave or "lurking-place"--may perhaps, agree. But this is not suggested by the word itself. This desperate act of Zimri, which has many parallels in Eastern history, seems to indicate that there was held to be something especially treasonable, and therefore unpardonable, in his assassination of Elah. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-20.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he worked, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">1Kings 16:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-31.htm" title="And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?">2Kings 9:31</a>.)<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken</span> [the meaning is probably that which Josephus gives: "When he saw that the city had none to defend it," or possibly, "when he saw that a breach was made"], <span class="cmt_word">that he went into the palace</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> citadel, fortress, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5da;&#x5e2;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. So Gesen., Keil, Bight, <span class="accented">al</span>. The palace, no doubt, consisted of a string of buildings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-9</a>) of which this was the highest and strongest part. Ewald thinks that the harem - a word which has almost the same radicals ? or women's apartment, is meant - the <span class="accented">most secluded</span> portion of the great palace (Josephus understands it to mean "the inmost part"), and hence infers, as also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a>, that the women of the palace had willingly submitted to the effeminate murderer of their lord, and that even the queen-mother had made advances towards him (vol. 4. p. 36). But, as Bight remarks there is nothing of this in the text, and Zimri's desperate act rather shows daring and contempt of death than effeminacy or sensuality. And <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>) seems to point to a stronghold rather than a seraglio] <span class="cmt_word">of the king's house, and burnt the king's house</span> [probably the palace which Jereboam had built. Ewald thinks it was this structure gave Tirzah its reputation for beauty; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-4.htm">Song of Solomon 6:4</a>] <span class="cmt_word">over him with fire</span> [According to the Syriac, the besiegers set fire to the palace. Similarly Jarchi. But the text is decisive. The parallel deed of Sardanapalus will occur to all readers. Rawlinson also refers to Herod. 1:176, and 7:107], <span class="cmt_word">and died.</span> [This word is intimately connected with the verse following. But there is no need to rearrange the verses. The text, as it stands, conveys clearly enough that Zimri's tragical death was a retribution for his sins. Bahr remarks that of Elah and Zimri we learn nothing, apart from the fact that they held to the sin of Jeroboam, except how they died.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:15-28 When men forsake God, they will be left to plague one another. Proud aspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years. Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Many wicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, and their names are found in history; but they have no name in the book of life.</body></html>
