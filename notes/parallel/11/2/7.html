It has been noted that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm" title="And they departed, and dwelled in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,">Jeremiah 41:17</a> there is a reference to "the habitation of Chimham," as being "by Bethlehem," David's own birthplace; as if David had given him inheritance there, out of what was especially his own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to the sons of Barzillai</span> [the "Beni-Barzillai" would include son, or sons, and all other descendants. It is highly probable, though it is not expressly stated, that Chimham was the son of Bar-zillai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>). Rawlinson says, "Who the other sons were is not known." It would be more correct to say that we do not know whether there were any other sons. The family was still existing <span class="accented">temp.</span> Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61</a>), where, it is worth noticing, we read of the <span class="accented">daughters</span> of Barzillai (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-63.htm">Nehemiah 7:63</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a>, we read of the <span class="accented">"habitation</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, caravanserai, khan) of Chemoham," where the Keri has Chimham. It has been argued from the mention of this name, and the fact that their khan was near Bethlehem, that David or Solomon gave the family land there], <span class="cmt_word">and let them be of those that eat at thy table</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of those who have their sustenance from the royal table, not necessarily at it (Keil); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-5.htm">Daniel 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a>.

It was esteemed an essential part of royal munificence throughout the East that the king should feed a large number of retainers and dependants. Cf. the account of Solomon's daffy provision in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-28.htm">2 Samuel 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">for so</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in like manner, with <span class="accented">food</span>]; <span class="cmt_word">they came to me</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">came near."</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> often includes, as here, the idea of succour. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-19.htm">Psalm 69:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-57.htm">Lamentations 3:57</a>. Barzillai certainly came (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>), and probably Chimham, but the Speaker's Commentary is mistaken when it says that "Chimham is mentioned as present." He was present at the return of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31, 38</a>, but not necessarily before] <span class="cmt_word">when I fled because of</span> [lit., "from the face of "] <span class="cmt_word">Absalom</span> <span class="cmt_word">thy brother.</span> The mention of Absalom, and those terrible days of revolt and anarchy, when he was constrained to flee for his life, seems to have reminded the dying king of one of the bitterest ingredients of that bitter cup of shame and suffering - the cruel curses of Shimei. He remembers that the sin of Shimei, which was nothing else than treason and blasphemy, has so far escaped punishment. In a moment of generous enthusiasm, he had included Shimei in the general amnesty which he proclaimed on his return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a>). He had thought, no doubt, at the time only of the offence against himself; he had forgotten his sacred and representative character as "the Lord's anointed;" or if he had remembered it (ver. 21) the emotions of that memorable day had obscured or perverted his sense of justice and duty. But he has since realized - and the thought weighs upon his conscience in the chamber of death - that he then pardoned what he had no power to pardon, viz., a sin to which the Mosaic law attached the penalty of death. For blasphemy, as for murder, there was no expiation short of the death of the blasphemer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14-16</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10, 13</a>); and blasphemy, like murder, though not perhaps to the same extent, involved those who heard it in its guilt, until they had discharged themselves of their sin upon the head of the guilty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-14.htm">Leviticus 14:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). But Shimei, so far from having suffered the penalty of the law, had been twice protected against it; twice preserved alive, in defiance of law, by the supreme magistrate, the executor of law. And David, who has been charging his son to keep the law, now realizes that he himself has been a law breaker. He has kept his oath, sworn to his own or his people's hurt, and he will keep it to the end. But Solomon is under no such obligation. <span class="accented">He</span> can demand the long arrears of justice, none the less due because of the time that has elapsed and the royal <span class="accented">laches</span> (<span class="accented">"nullum tempus occurrit regi"</span>); he can deal with the blasphemer as the law directs, and this David now charges him to do. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 These dying counsels concerning Joab and Shimei, did not come from personal anger, but for the security of Solomon's throne, which was the murders he had committed, but would readily repeat them to carry any purpose; though long reprieved, he shall be reckoned with at last. Time does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder. Concerning Shimei, Hold him not guiltless; do not think him any true friend to thee, or thy government, or fit to be trusted; he has no less malice now than he had then. David's dying sentiments are recorded, as delivered under the influence of the Holy Ghost,</body></html>
