And Solomon son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem: and the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and largeness of heart, as the sand by the sea-shore. And the wisdom of Solomon abounded exceedingly beyond the wisdom of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt: and he took the daughter of Pharao, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord first, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. In seven years he made and finished <i>them</i>. And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eight thousand hewers of stone in the mountain: and Solomon made the sea, and the bases, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the brazen sea&#8212;and he built the citadel as a defence above it, he made a breach in the wall of the city of David: thus the daughter of Pharao went up out of the city of David to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel: and Solomon offered up three whole-burnt-offerings in the year, and peace-offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord, and finished the house. And these are the chief persons who presided over the works of Solomon; three thousand and six hundred masters of the people that wrought the works. And he burit Assur, and Magdo, and Gazer, and upper Baethoron, and Ballath: only after he had built the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about, afterwards he built these cities. And when David was yet living, he charged Solomon, saying, Behold, there is with thee Semei the son of Gera, of the seed of Benjamin out of Chebron: he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, He shall not be slain with the sword. But now do not thou hold him guiltless, for thou art a man of understanding, and thou wilt know what thou shalt do to him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/drb/1_kings/2.htm">Douay-Rheims Bible</a></span><br />And the king appointed Banaias the son of Joiada in his room over the army, and Sadoc the priest he put in the place of Abiathar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/dbt/1_kings/2.htm">Darby Bible Translation</a></span><br />And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host; and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/erv/1_kings/2.htm">English Revised Version</a></span><br />And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/wbt/1_kings/2.htm">Webster's Bible Translation</a></span><br />And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army: and Zadok the priest the king put in the room of Abiathar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/web/1_kings/2.htm">World English Bible</a></span><br />The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the place of Abiathar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ylt/1_kings/2.htm">Young's Literal Translation</a></span><br /> and the king putteth Benaiah son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host, and Zadok the priest hath the king put in the stead of Abiathar.</div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheadingv"><b>Study Bible</b></div><span class="hdg"><a href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_kings/2.htm">The Execution of Joab</a></span><br>&#8230;<span class="reftext">34</span>So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck down Joab, and killed him.

No engagements or dangers will restrain worldly men; they go on, though they forfeit their lives and souls. Let us remember, God will not accommodate his judgment to us. His eye is over us; and let us strive to walk as in his presence. Let our every act, word, and thought, be governed by this great truth, that the hour is quickly coming when the smallest circumstances of our lives shall be brought to light, and our eternal state be fixed by a righteous and unerring God. Thus Solomon's throne was established in peace, as the type of the Redeemer's kingdom of peace and righteousness. And it is a comfort, in reference to the enmity of the church's enemies, that, how much soever they rage, it is a vain thing they imagine. Christ's throne is established, and they cannot shake it.</body></html>
