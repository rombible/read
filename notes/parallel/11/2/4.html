In the promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. there is no mention of any stipulations, <span class="accented">"If</span> thy children," etc. But both here and in Psalm 122:12, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>, special prominence is given to the <span class="accented">condition</span> (<span class="accented">dum se bene gesserint</span>), which no doubt was understood, if not expressed, when the promise was first made], saying, <span class="cmt_word">If thy children take</span> <span class="cmt_word">heed to</span> [lit., "keep," same word as in vers. 2, 3] <span class="cmt_word">their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee</span> [lit., "be cut off to thee," as marg.

This word does not occur in the original promise made through Nathan. But it <span class="accented">does</span> occur in subsequent versions of the promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>, as well as here - a strong presumption that the promise must have been repeated to David in another shape], <span class="cmt_word">said he, a man on the throne of Israel.</span> But this thought - that the permanence of his dynasty depended on the faithful observance of the law as it is written in the book of Moses (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in all its details), seems to have reminded the dying man that he himself had not always kept the statutes he was urging his successor to keep. It had been his duty as king, as the power ordained of God, to visit all violations of the law of God with their appropriate penalties; and this duty, in some instances at least, had been neglected. For the law of Moses, reaffirming the primaeval law which formed part of the so called "precepts of Noah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>) - that ix. blood must be expiated by blood - enjoined, with singular emphasis and distinctness, the death of the murderer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16, 17, 18, 19, 30-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>). It declared that so long as murder remained unpunished, the whole land was defiled and under a curse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>). And it gave the king no power to pardon, no discretion in the matter. Until the red stain of blood was washed out "by the blood of him that shed it" the Divine Justice was not satisfied, and a famine or pestilence or sword might smite the land. Now, David knew all this: he could not fail to know it, for he had seen his country, a few years before, visited by a famine because of the unavenged blood of the Gibeonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>). And yet, one notorious and infamous murderer had not been put to death. The assassin of Abner and of Amasa still polluted the earth, still occupied a distinguished position, and defied punishment. But if the law of Moses was to be kept, then, whatever it might cost, and however painful it might be (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>), he must die; and David, for the welfare of his kingdom, the stability of his throne, and above all, the honour of God, must require his death. No doubt it had often burdened his mind, especially during these last days of feebleness, the thought that punishment had been so long delayed; and therefore, as he sees the end approaching, he feels that he must enjoin upon his successor the fulfilment of that duty which he had been too "weak" to discharge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>). Hence he proceeds, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 David's charge to Solomon is, to keep the charge of the Lord. The authority of a dying father is much, but nothing to that of a living God. God promised David that the Messiah should come from his descendants, and that promise was absolute; but the promise, that there should not fail of them a man on the throne of Israel, was conditional; if he walks before God in sincerity, with zeal and resolution: in order hereunto, he must take heed to his way.</body></html>
