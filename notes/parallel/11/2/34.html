It is remarkable that retribution thus overtook Joab on the very scene of his last murder, for it was "at the great stone which is in Gibeon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>), that he slew Amasa. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>: "I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord"], <span class="cmt_word">and fell upon him, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">slew him: and he was buried in his own house</span> [possibly in the courtyard: hardly in the garden. The same is recorded of Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1</a>). It was evidently an exceptional occurrence. Remembering the estimation in which the Jew held the corpse and the grave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11, 16, 22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>), it must have been a singular honour to make of the house a mausoleum. No doubt it was designed to be such in Joab's case. Whatever his crimes, his services had deserved well of his country. Possibly his friends were led to pay him this special honour as a kind of counterpoise to the ignominy of his death] <span class="cmt_word">in the wilderness</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Judah. Joab's mother was of Bethlehem, which was on the border of the desert. The "wilderness of Tekoah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>), according to Jerome, was visible from Bethlehem, being but six Roman miles distant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:26-34 Solomon's words to Abiathar, and his silence, imply that some recent conspiracies had been entered into. Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it. The Lord of peace himself gives us that peace which is everlasting.</body></html>
