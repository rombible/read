and it is also notable that, although the real motive for putting him to death was to punish his support of Adonijah, now renewed, yet Solomon's words in pronouncing sentence on him refrain from mention of anything except the old crimes dwelt upon in the dying charge of David. Possibly this was done to bring Joab's case within the emphatic declaration of the Law, that no sanctuary should protect the wilful and treacherous murderer, and that innocent blood, so shed and left unavenged, would pollute the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm" title="But if a man come presumptuously on his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.">Exodus 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm" title="So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are: for blood it defiles the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.">Numbers 35:33</a>). It is significant, moreover, of the increased power of the monarchy, even in hands young and yet untried, that the old captain of the host, who had been "too hard" for David, even before David's great sin, should now fall, as it would seem, without a single act of resistance or word of remonstrance on his behalf, after a long career of faithful service, only once tarnished by disloyalty. It has been noticed that if (as is probable) the "Tabernacle of the Lord" at Gibeon is meant, Joab falls close to the scene of his murder of Amasa, "at the great stone in Gibeon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-18.htm" title="Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.">2Samuel 20:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then tidings</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And the</span> <span class="accented">report</span>, etc. Not necessarily of Abiathar's deposition, but certainly of Adonijah's death] <span class="cmt_word">came to Joab, for Joab had turned after</span> [same expression as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-3.htm">Judges 9:3</a>] <span class="cmt_word">Adonijah, though</span> [lit., and] <span class="cmt_word">he turned not after Absalom.</span> [The LXX. (Cod. Vat.), Vulg., and all ancient versions except the Chald., here read <span class="accented">Solomon</span>, which Ewald and Thenius adopt. This reading is perhaps too summarily dismissed by most commentators, as involving a statement which would be self evident and superfluous. But it is not so. The meaning would then be that Joab had inclined to Adonijah, and had not, subsequently, gone over to the side of Solomon - information which is much less obvious than that he had not "gone after Absalom." The Arabic version may thus be nearest the truth, which reads, "Neither did he love Solomon." Somewhat similarly Josephus.] <span class="cmt_word">And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> [As Adonijah had done before him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>). His flight is almost certain evidence of his guilt. ("Joab vero seipsum prodidit." Munster.) Why should he flee, if conscious of innocence? Solomon had acted generously before, and Joab would not be aware of David's dying instructions. His two assassinations had remained so long unpunished that he would hardly expect to be called to an account for them now. We have here, therefore, another indication of a second conspiracy, and it is an old belief (Theodorot, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that Joab had suggested to Adonijah the plan of marriage with Abishag. Some have asked why Joab should flee to the altar when his crimes deprived him of the right of the sanctuary. But a drowning man grasps at a straw. It is probable that he never thought of his murders, but only of his treason. According to the Rabbis, death at the altar ensured him burial amongst his fathers (Munster). But, if this were so, it would hardly enter into his calculations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:26-34 Solomon's words to Abiathar, and his silence, imply that some recent conspiracies had been entered into. Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it. The Lord of peace himself gives us that peace which is everlasting.</body></html>
