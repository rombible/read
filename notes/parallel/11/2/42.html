The LXX: embodies this information as a direct statement in the text of ver. 37, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>, but it is obviously a gloss] <span class="cmt_word">and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day that thou goest but and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</span> [The LXX.

Probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, "which,"is to be understood. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:35-46 The old malignity remains in the unconverted heart, and a watchful eye should be kept on those who, like Shimei, have manifested their enmity, but have given no evidence of repentance. No engagements or dangers will restrain worldly men; they go on, though they forfeit their lives and souls. Let us remember, God will not accommodate his judgment to us. His eye is over us; and let us strive to walk as in his presence. Let our every act, word, and thought, be governed by this great truth, that the hour is quickly coming when the smallest circumstances of our lives shall be brought to light, and our eternal state be fixed by a righteous and unerring God. Thus Solomon's throne was established in peace, as the type of the Redeemer's kingdom of peace and righteousness. And it is a comfort, in reference to the enmity of the church's enemies, that, how much soever they rage, it is a vain thing they imagine. Christ's throne is established, and they cannot shake it.</body></html>
