In David we always see the living man, whose soul longs after God with a vivid personal devotion. Solomon is emphatically the king, sitting on the throne of David, with his house established for ever. In the majesty of his royalty his individual character is to us almost entirely merged.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and now</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> as the Lord liveth, which hath established me, and set me</span> [a <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> has here crept into the text; obviously owing to the fact that this same letter both precedes and follows] <span class="cmt_word">on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house</span> [Keil and Wordsworth understand by this expression, "hath given me issue." "Solomon," says Keil, "had already one son, viz., Rehoboam, about a year old (comp. 1 Kings 11:42 with 1 Kings 14:21, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>)." But some doubt seems to attach to the "forty and one years" mentioned as the age of Rehoboam at his accession. Bahr says Solomon's "marriage did not occur till afterwards (1 Kings 3:1).

It ill becomes a good man to prefer a bad request, or to appear in a bad cause. According to eastern customs it was plain that Adonijah sought to be king, by his asking for Abishag as his wife, and Solomon could not be safe while he lived. Ambitious, turbulent spirits commonly prepare death for themselves. Many a head has been lost by catching at a crown.</body></html>
