We may notice how constantly the name of each king's mother is recorded in the history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Adonijah,</span> <span class="cmt_word">the son of Haggith, came to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon.</span> [The LXX. adds <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, but the words are probably inserted from ver. 19. The historian now relates the plot of Adonijah and its defeat. Foiled in his purpose to mount the throne by direct means, Adonijah and his advisers have recourse to intrigue and subtlety. By the aid of Abishag, he hopes to accomplish what his chariots and horsemen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>) had failed to effect. And he first addresses himself to the queen mother (<span class="accented">"Aggreditur mulierem, ut regnandi ignaram ira amoribus facilem."</span> Grotius). The position of the queen dowager m the Hebrew kingdom was an influential one; not unlike that of the Valide sultana amongst the Ottomans. Hence the constant mention of each king's mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-10.htm">1 Kings 15:10</a>, where notice ver. 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>, etc.; hence, too, the part which such a queen mother as Athaliah found it possible to take. This pre-eminence was a natural result of the polygamy of Eastern sovereigns (and the consequent intrigues of the harem), coupled with the high estimation in which the mother was held in the East.] <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Comest thou peaceably.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Is it peace thy coming!</span> Bathsheba was evidently surprised by his visit. Owing to the part he had taken against her son, there would naturally have been but few dealings, if not positive alienation, between them. Her first thought, consequently, is, "What can this coming mean?" The prominence of the idea of <span class="accented">peace</span> in all Eastern salutations has often been noticed.
