The words sound like a <span class="accented">reminiscence</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23.htm">Joshua 23, 24</a>. Perhaps, too, the thought of Joshua suggested to his mind the next words]: <span class="cmt_word">but</span> <span class="cmt_word">be thou strong, and be a man.</span> [Similar, though not identical, words were four times addressed to Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6, 7, 9, 18</a>), and David may well have thought that his son, in entering upon his difficult duties, was not at all unlike Joshua when he succeeded Moses in the leadership of Israel, and that he needed similar encouragement. It is not necessary to suppose, as Canon Rawlinson does ("Speaker's Com.," vol. 2 p. 489), that in the words, "show thyself a man," we have a reference to Solomon's <span class="accented">youth</span>; for words precisely similar were addressed to each other by the Philistines at Aphek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>). The age of Solomon at his accession is very doubtful. David said, "Solomon my son is young and tender" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>); and Solomon says of himself, "I am a little child" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>). Josephus, probably reflecting the tradition of his time, fixes his age at fourteen; Eupolemus at twelve. I incline to think that the words "young and tender" almost forbid the favourite opinion that he was about twenty.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 David's charge to Solomon is, to keep the charge of the Lord. The authority of a dying father is much, but nothing to that of a living God. God promised David that the Messiah should come from his descendants, and that promise was absolute; but the promise, that there should not fail of them a man on the throne of Israel, was conditional; if he walks before God in sincerity, with zeal and resolution: in order hereunto, he must take heed to his way.</body></html>
