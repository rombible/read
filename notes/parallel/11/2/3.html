He is to "show himself a man," in spite of his youth; he is to take heed in all things to follow the Law of the Lord; he is to trust both in the general promise of God to obedience, and in the special promise made to the house of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2Samuel 7:12-16</a>). It is remarkably in harmony with the beautiful Psalm, "the last words of David," preserved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/23-3.htm" title="The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.">2Samuel 23:3-5</a>, telling how "he that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God," and, in spite of consciousness of shortcomings from this high ideal, trusting in the "everlasting covenant of God" with him, "ordered in all things, and sure." Nor does it accord less with the equally beautiful prayer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/29-18.htm" title="O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to you:">1Chronicles 29:18-19</a>, for Solomon and for the people. In all this David speaks in the spirit of a true servant and saint of God. But in the special charges that follow we see the worldly prudence of the old statesman, and in one case some trace of long-remembered grudge, singularly true to imperfect human nature, although utterly unworthy of an ideal picture of a hero-king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And keep the charge</span> [lit., "watch the watch" (<span class="accented">custodies custodiam Jehovae</span>), or, "serve the service." Bahr paraphrases, "be a true watcher in the service of Jehovah." The words are constantly employed to denote a strict performance of the service of the tabernacle or of the duties of the priests and Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-35.htm">Leviticus 8:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-30.htm">Leviticus 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-7.htm">Numbers 3:7, 8, 25, 28, 32, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-30.htm">Numbers 31:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-32.htm">1 Chronicles 23:32</a>, etc.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-5.htm">Genesis 26:5</a>). "The reference," says Rawlinson, "is to the charge given to all the kings in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>." But there is no necessity for restricting it to that one injunction. What the charge is is explained presently] <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord thy God to walk in His ways, to keep</span> [same word] <span class="cmt_word">His statutes, and His commandments, and His</span> <span class="cmt_word">judgments, and His testimonies</span> [it is impossible to draw any clear and sharp distinction between these four words, as the older expositors do. "The phrase is derived from the Pentateuch" (Wordsworth). The force of the accumulation of practically synonymous terms is to represent the law in its entirety (<span class="accented">"Die Totalitat des Gesetzes,"</span> Keil); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-31.htm">Deuteronomy 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11</a>, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>.], <span class="cmt_word">that thou mayest prosper.</span> [The marginal rendering, "do wisely," is preferred by some (Keil, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>); but the translation of the text has the authority of Gesenius and others on its side, and gives a better meaning. "The context evidently requires 'prosper' here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>" (Rawlinson). "That thou mayest... <span class="accented">do wisely"</span> is a very lame and impotent conclusion to ver. 3. We have here an evident reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; possibly also of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>. David was unquestionably well versed in the Scriptures of that age, of which every king was commanded to make a copy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 David's charge to Solomon is, to keep the charge of the Lord. The authority of a dying father is much, but nothing to that of a living God. God promised David that the Messiah should come from his descendants, and that promise was absolute; but the promise, that there should not fail of them a man on the throne of Israel, was conditional; if he walks before God in sincerity, with zeal and resolution: in order hereunto, he must take heed to his way.</body></html>
