The reception was clearly a public one, if the interview was private. But the original is simply, "and he set," etc., suggesting that Solomon may have done it, as a mark of respect, with his own hands. He "received his mother as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>).

It ill becomes a good man to prefer a bad request, or to appear in a bad cause. According to eastern customs it was plain that Adonijah sought to be king, by his asking for Abishag as his wife, and Solomon could not be safe while he lived. Ambitious, turbulent spirits commonly prepare death for themselves. Many a head has been lost by catching at a crown.</body></html>
