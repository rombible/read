Possibly the desperate character of Joab made literal compliance with this command well nigh impossible. The attempt to drag him from his place of refuge might have led to a bloody encounter. And the king evidently felt that Joab's crimes justified exceptional measures], <span class="cmt_word">and bury him</span> [why this injunction? Possibly because the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> seemed to Solomon to require it. Both Bahr and Keil think it was that Joab's services to the kingdom might be requited with an honourable sepulture. Was it not rather that the corpse might be removed with all possible haste from the sanctuary, which it defiled, and hidden from view, as one accursed of God, in the earth? So Bishop Hall: "He sends Benaiah to take away the offender both from God and men, from the altar and the world"]; <span class="cmt_word">that thou mayest take away</span> [LXX.

Innocent blood, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, blood not shed in war, or forfeited to justice, rested upon the community, or the authorities responsible for its punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-9.htm">Deuteronomy 21:9</a>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>) until satisfaction was made. See on ver. 5], <span class="cmt_word">which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</span> [Heb. "from <span class="accented">upon</span> me." Solomon evidently believed that the guilt of blood was upon him and his house so long as Abner's and Amasa's blood remained unavenged ("The blood that is not required from the murderer will be required from the magistrate." Henry), and that he and his seed might have to answer for it, as Saul's seed had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1, 9</a>). This is one of the many considerations which show that both David and Solomon were actuated not by "cold-blooded vengeance" or "long-cherished resentment" (Stanley), but by a sense of duty. In fact, Jewish law imperatively demanded the death of Joab, and to spare him was to violate all law, and to imperil the throne and the people. "Only a superficial observer," says Ewald, "can here reproach Solomon with needless severity."] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:26-34 Solomon's words to Abiathar, and his silence, imply that some recent conspiracies had been entered into. Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it. The Lord of peace himself gives us that peace which is everlasting.</body></html>
