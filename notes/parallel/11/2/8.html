And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;">2Samuel 19:18-23</a>). It is, perhaps, partly dictated by policy; for the notice of Shimei (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/16-5.htm" title="And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.">2Samuel 16:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-17.htm" title="And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.">2Samuel 19:17</a>) shows that he was powerful, and that he assumed a dangerous championship of the fallen house of Saul. But there are unmistakable traces of the old grudge rankling in David's heart, reminding us of the bitterness of such psalms as Psalms 69.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, thou hast with thee</span> [Bahr understands by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>, "near thee," (<span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">deiner Nahe</span>) because Bahurim was near Jerusalem. Keil gathers from this word that Shimei "was living at that time in Jerusalem," and refers to ver. 36, which, if anything, implies that he was not. But it is worth suggesting whether Shimei may not be the Shimei to whom reference is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>. (Dean Stanley notices this as a possibility, but alleges nothing in support of it: "Jewish Church," vol. 2 p. 171, note.) We there find Shimei and Rei mentioned as firm adherents of Solomon at the time of Adonijah's rising, and in these words, they "were not <span class="accented">with Adonijah."</span> Surely it is not an unfair presumption - if there is nothing to rebut it - that the Shimei subsequently mentioned as "with" Solomon is the same person. But it has been objected (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Kitto) that the false part that Shimei played at the time of Absalom's revolt would have forever prevented his being recognized and mentioned as one of Solomon's supporters. I very much doubt it. The great influence which Shimei possessed must be taken into account. Nothing shows that influence more clearly than the fact that on the day of David's restoration, despite the part he had taken, and the possible disgrace and danger that awaited him, he could still command the attendance of one thousand men of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). Probably the secret of his influence lay in the fact that he was "of the family of the house of Saul," and possibly, owing to the insignificance of Saul's descendants, was the mainstay and chief representative of that house. And if so, there is nothing at all surprising in the mention of the fact that he was "not with Adonijah," and was subsequently "with" Solomon. It may have been a matter of great consequence at that critical time, which side Shimei - and the thousand or more Benjamites at his back - espoused. And if he <span class="accented">did</span> then declare for Solomon, it could hardly fail to procure him some amount of favour and consideration. He would thenceforward rank amongst the friends of the young king, and the words "thou hast with thee" would accurately describe his position] <span class="cmt_word">Shimei, the son of Gera</span> [another Shimei, the son of Elah, is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>) as Solomon's officer <span class="accented">in Benjamin.</span> Gera must not be thought of as the "father" of Shimei, except in the sense of ancestor. He was removed from him by many generations, being the son of Bela and the grandson of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6</a>). Ehud, three hundred years earlier, is also described as "a son of Gera," <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>], <span class="cmt_word">a Benjamite</span> [lit., <span class="accented">the</span> Benjamite, meaning that Gera, not Shimei, was the Benjamite. He was well known as the son of Benjamin's firstborn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8.htm">1 Chronicles 8</a>:l), and the head of a house in Benjamin. Professor Gardiner (American translation of Lange, textual note, p. 29), following the LXX. and Vulg., insists that, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (with the article) can only mean "son of the Jaminite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the descendants of Jamin, a son of Simeon." But this is directly contrary to what we read 9 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, viz., that Shimei was of "a family of the house of Saul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a Benjamite. And to this the grammar agrees. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a> is an exact parallel, and compare <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-14.htm">1 Samuel 6:14, 18</a>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-58.htm">1 Samuel 17:58</a>] of Bahurim [the name means "<span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">young men</span>." It was some six miles distant from Jerusalem, in Benjamin, and on (or off, as Josephus, Ant. 7:09, 7, implies) the main road to Jericho and the Jordan valley. It may have lain in one of the waddies branching out from the ravine which runs continuously alongside the steep descent to Jericho. The event narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a> as happening at Bahurim may well have served to inflame Shimei's hatred. In spite of his rancorous hostility, however, we gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-18.htm">2 Samuel 17:18</a>, that David had some faithful adherents there], <span class="cmt_word">which</span> [lit., "and he"] <span class="cmt_word">cursed me with a grievous</span> [acc. to Gesenius, <span class="accented">al.</span>, "strong," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, sweeping; Keil, vehement; Thenius, "<span class="accented">heillos</span>," flagitious.

Time does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder. Concerning Shimei, Hold him not guiltless; do not think him any true friend to thee, or thy government, or fit to be trusted; he has no less malice now than he had then.
