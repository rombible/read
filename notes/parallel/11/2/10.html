They became the regular tombs of the kings, with some exceptions particularly noticed. It was in token of special honour that the high priest Jehoiada, the preserver of the royal dynasty, was buried therein (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-16.htm" title="And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.">2Chronicles 24:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="cmt_word">David</span> <span class="cmt_word">slept</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">lay down</span>].

It points to the grave rather than to Sheol (Gesen.), though the latter idea is not excluded.

Intramural interment was permitted only to prophets and kings. Jerusalem is completely under. mined by caves and caverns, and Zion is no exception to the rule. One of these, possibly enlarged, probably became the burying place of the kings. It was known, not only in Nehemiah's day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15, 16</a>), but down to the age of the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29</a>). Probably owing to a misunderstanding of St. Peter's words, "his sepulchre is <span class="accented">with us,"</span> etc., the <span class="accented">Coenaculum</span> is now shown as David's tomb. Josephus says Solomon placed a vast quantity of treasure with the body, three thousand talents of which were taken out by Hyrcanus (Ant. 13:08.4). He has also a curious story of an attempted plunder of the tomb by Herod (Ant. 16:07.1) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 These dying counsels concerning Joab and Shimei, did not come from personal anger, but for the security of Solomon's throne, which was the murders he had committed, but would readily repeat them to carry any purpose; though long reprieved, he shall be reckoned with at last. Time does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder. Concerning Shimei, Hold him not guiltless; do not think him any true friend to thee, or thy government, or fit to be trusted; he has no less malice now than he had then. David's dying sentiments are recorded, as delivered under the influence of the Holy Ghost,</body></html>
