The numbers may have been recorded because of the correspondency]: <span class="cmt_word">and after them he numbered all the people, even all</span> <span class="cmt_word">the children of Israel, being seven thousand</span>. [This number is of course to be understood, unlike that of ch. 19:18, literally. And the context (cf. ver. 19) shows that this was the number of fighting men. But this small army can hardly fail to create surprise, especially if we compare it with the statistics of the soldiery of an earlier age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>). It is true this was not strictly an army, but a garrison for the defence of the capital. But it looks very much as if, under the feeble rule of Ahab, the kingdom of Israel had become thoroughly disorganized. "The position of Jarchi is that of a true Rabbi, viz., that the 7000 were those who had not bowed the knee unto Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>)," Bahr.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:12-21 The proud Syrians were beaten, and the despised Israelites were conquerors. The orders of the proud, drunken king disordered his troops, and prevented them from attacking the Israelites. Those that are most secure, are commonly least courageous. Ahab slew the Syrians with a great slaughter. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another.</body></html>
