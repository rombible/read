<span class="cmt_word">thy wives also and thy children</span> [Nothing reveals Ben-hadad's object more clearly than the mention of Ahab's wives. When we consider how jealously the seraglio of an Eastern prince is guarded, and how the surrender of the harem is a virtual surrender of the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21, 22</a>; note on 1 Kings 2:22), and certainly a surrender of all manhood and self-respect, we see that his aim was to wound Ahab in his tenderest point, to humble him to the lowest depths of degradation, and possibly to <span class="accented">force</span> a quarrel upon him], <span class="cmt_word">even the goodliest</span> [The LXX. omits this. Bahr says the word can only apply to the sons, and that it must mean the most eminent young men of the city - not Ahab's children - whom Ben-hadad demanded as hostages. But against this is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Ahab's answer, "All that I have," etc.; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fact that Ben-hadad obviously meant insult and plunder; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the language of ver. 7, where see note], <span class="cmt_word">are mine</span>. [Heb. <span class="accented">mine</span> <span class="accented">are they</span>. Rawlinson would explain this excessive demand of the Syrian king by the assumption that when it was made the siege had already lasted a long time, and that the people were now reduced to the greatest straits, circumstances which the historian, with the characteristic brevity of the sacred writers, omits to mention. But really no such supposition is needed. The overwhelming force which Ben-hadad had at his back would, in his eyes, justify any demands. <span class="accented">And the prima facie</span> view of ver. 2 is that the messengers were sent on the first approach of the army, or rather at the beginning of the siege.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Benhadad sent Ahab a very insolent demand. Ahab sent a very disgraceful submission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out of the Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guilt dispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men will part with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to save their lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with any pleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayings that ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly to boast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth. Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence. Happy is the man who is never off his watch.</body></html>
