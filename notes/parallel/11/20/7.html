Rawlinson builds on this slender basis the conclusion that the council of elders which, he says, belonged to the undivided kingdom, had been continued among the ten tribes, had an important place in the government, and held regular sittings at the capital] <span class="cmt_word">and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man</span> [or <span class="accented">fellow</span>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> expresses either hatred or contempt. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2, 18</a>, etc.] seeketh mischief [the purport of Ahab's address is not, "Ben-hadad is not satisfied with my treasures; he wants yours also" (Bahr), for there is no reference whatsoever to <span class="accented">their</span> property, but, "See how he is determined on our ruin. Nothing short of our destruction will suffice him. He is bent on provoking an encounter, that he may plunder the city at pleasure." The salient word is the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>]: <span class="cmt_word">far he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children</span> [LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>.

It is difficult to conceive that any monarch could gravely proclaim his own shame to his counsellors; could confess, that is, that he had consented to surrender his children and concubines without a struggle.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Benhadad sent Ahab a very insolent demand. Ahab sent a very disgraceful submission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out of the Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guilt dispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men will part with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to save their lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with any pleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayings that ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly to boast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth. Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence. Happy is the man who is never off his watch.</body></html>
