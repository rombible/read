And the man refused to smite him.">1Kings 20:35</a> that the prophetic order was now numerous. The vindication of the majesty of God before the Syrians, as well as before Israel--like the more celebrated case of the rebuke of the blasphemy of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/19-16.htm" title="LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.">2Kings 19:16-34</a>)--is in accordance with the prayer of Solomon, or the similar utterances in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-2.htm" title="That your way may be known on earth, your saving health among all nations.">Psalm 67:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-15.htm" title="So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth your glory.">Psalm 102:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-4.htm" title="All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD, when they hear the words of your mouth.">Psalm 138:4</a>), "That all the people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee;" and also with such prophetic declarations as those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:9</a>, "I wrought for my Name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen." It is a foreshadowing of that view of all nations, as in some degree having knowledge of God and probation before Him, which is afterwards worked out fully in the prophetic writings. The intense and powerful Monotheism of the religion of Israel, in spite of all its backslidings, could hardly have been without influence over the neighbouring nations (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm" title="And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.">2Kings 5:15</a>), especially at a time when the remembrance of Solomon's vast empire, and still wider influence, would yet linger through the tenacious traditions of the East.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came a man of God</span> [Whether this is the same person as the "prophet" of vers. 13, 22, is not quite clear.

They take it for granted that it was not Israel, but Israel's gods, that beat them; but they speak very ignorantly of Jehovah. They supposed that Israel had many gods, to whom they ascribed limited power within a certain district; thus vain were the Gentiles in their imaginations concerning God. The greatest wisdom in worldly concerns is often united with the most contemptible folly in the things of God.</body></html>
