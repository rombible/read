(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-4.htm" title="But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.">Amos 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-27.htm" title="And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.">Jeremiah 49:27</a>.) From the allusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-34.htm" title="And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.">1Kings 20:34</a> it appears that this Ben-hadad was the son of a king who had been victorious against Omri--possibly pushing still further the advantage gained in the time of Baasha. It is evident that he assumed, perhaps by inheritance, a sovereignty over Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Thirty and two kings.</span>--All the notices of Syria show it as divided into small kingdoms, confederated from time to time under some leading power. In the days of David this leading power was that of Hadadezer of Zobah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/8-3.htm" title="David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.">2Samuel 8:3-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-19.htm" title="And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.">2Samuel 10:19</a>), although Hamath was apparently independent. Now Damascus, under the dynasty of Hadad, assumes a most formidable predominance. Ahab cannot stand before it, but shuts himself up, probably after defeat, within the strong walls of Samaria.<p>(2?4) <span class= "bld">And he sent.</span>--This message and the answer of Ahab ("My lord, O king") are the assertion and acceptance of Syrian sovereignty over Israel: all the possessions and the family of the vassal are acknowledged to be the property of his superior lord. Ahab surrenders, but not at discretion. Ben-hadad refuses all qualified submission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ben-hadad</span> [See on 1 Kings 11:14 and 1 Kings 15:18.

We learn from ver. 34 that this prince was the son of a Syrian king who had conquered some of the cities of Israel, but we cannot nevertheless be certain that he was the son of that Ben-hadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>) who invaded Israel in the reign of Baasha (Ewald), See on ver. 34.] <span class="cmt_word">the king of Syria gathered all his host</span> [See note on 1 Kings 10:2, where we have same word] <span class="cmt_word">together: and there were thirty and two kings with him</span> [Evidently these were vassals, not allied powers. The number alone proves that they must have been petty princes or chieftains of Hittite tribes, ruling over very limited districts' and all acknowledging the suzerainty of the king of Damascus, all paying tribute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>) and furnishing a contingent in time of war "The Assyrian inscriptions show that this country was, about the period in question, parcelled out into a number of petty kingdoms," etc. (Rawlinson.

We see here the fruit and retribution of Solomon's irreligious policy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a> and Homiletics, p. 216). "A king who has been probably identified with this Ben-hadad brought into the field against Assyria nearly 4000 chariots" (Rawlinson)]: <span class="cmt_word">and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it</span>. [The object of this expedition was clearly to humble and to plunder the kingdom of Samaria. It would almost appear, from the <span class="accented">animus</span> of the Syrian king and the studied offensiveness of his messages, as if Ahab or Israel must have given him dire offence. But Ben-hadad was clearly a vain and overbearing and tyrannical prince, and the only crime of Israel may have been that it was independent of him, or had refused to do him homage.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Benhadad sent Ahab a very insolent demand. Ahab sent a very disgraceful submission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out of the Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guilt dispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men will part with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to save their lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with any pleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayings that ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly to boast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth. Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence. Happy is the man who is never off his watch.</body></html>
