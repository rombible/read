It is notable that in all these political functions of prophecy Elijah does not appear, reserving himself for the higher moral and religious mission from God. Ahab receives the prophet's message with perfect confidence and reverence; he has returned in profession to the allegiance to Jehovah, which he had, perhaps, never wholly relinquished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there came a prophet</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">one prophet.</span> Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>.

Where Elijah was at this time, or why he was not employed, we have no means of determining. Bahr says that he was "least of all suited for such a message," but not if he had learned the lesson of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>. At the same time, it is to be remembered that he invariably appears as the minister of wrath. It may also be reasonably asked why this gracious interposition was granted to the kingdom of Samaria at all. Was not this invasion, and would not the sack of the city have been, a just recompense for the gross corruption of the age, for the persecution of the prophets, etc.? But to this it may be replied that Ben-hadad was not then the instrument which God had designed for the correction of Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-17.htm">1 Kings 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>), and furthermore that by his brutal tyranny and despotic demands, he had himself merited a chastisement. The city, too, may have been delivered for the sake of the seven thousand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-34.htm">2 Kings 19:34</a>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-26.htm">Genesis 18:26</a> sqq.) But this gracious help in the time of extremity was primarily designed as a proof of Jehovah's power over the gods of Syria (cf. vers. 13, 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a> sqq.), and so as an instrument for the conversion of Israel.
