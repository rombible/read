The phrase probably implies a threat of destruction, as well as a boast of overwhelming strength. Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. </span>viii. 14, 2) has a curious explanation--that, if each of the Syrians took only a handful of dust, they could raise a mound against the city, higher than the walls of Samaria.<p>The historian, with a touch of patriotic scorn, paints Ben-hadad as a luxurious and insolent braggart. He receives the message at a feast, "drinking himself drunk," and, stung by its tone of sarcasm, does not condescend to bestir himself, but orders his servants to an instant attack. The command is given, with a haughty brevity, in a single word ("Set"), which may be "Array troops," or "Place engines," as in the margin. The LXX. translates, "Build a stockade" (for attack on the walls).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said</span> [These words would be quite superfluous, if the oaths of which we now hear were the "word" of ver. 9], <span class="cmt_word">The gods do so unto me, and more also</span> [see notes on 1 Kings 2:23; 19:2], <span class="cmt_word">if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls</span> [The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> pugilli, is fixed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>] <span class="cmt_word">for all the people that follow me.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">that are in my feet</span>.

Ben-bahad vows that he will make Samaria a heap of dust, and at the same time affirms that so overwhelming is his host, that this dust will be insufficient to fill the hands of his soldiers. Rawlinson compares with it the well-known saying of the Trachinian to Dieneces, that the Median arrows would obscure the sun (Herod. 7:226), but <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-18.htm">2 Samuel 17:18</a> is still more apposite.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Benhadad sent Ahab a very insolent demand. Ahab sent a very disgraceful submission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out of the Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guilt dispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men will part with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to save their lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with any pleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayings that ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly to boast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth. Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence. Happy is the man who is never off his watch.</body></html>
