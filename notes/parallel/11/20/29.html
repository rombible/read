It may have been by the direction of the man of God that the Israelites attacked on the seventh day, or the precedent of Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-15.htm">Joshua 6:15</a>) may have influenced their leaders; or the number seven, properly the mark and signature of the covenant, may have come to be regarded superstitiously - in fact, as a lucky number (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-11.htm">Isaiah 65:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>]: <span class="cmt_word">and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.</span> [This prodigious slaughter may well create surprise. That two comparatively small companies should be able, physically, to slay, with the rude weapons of that age, 100,000 warriors, fighting for their lives, seems hardly credible. It is probable, therefore, that the numbers here, as elsewhere, have been exaggerated in the course of transcription. Another explanation of the difficulty has, indeed, been suggested by Bahr, viz., that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> may signify here, as it undoubtedly does elsewhere, "defeated," "put to flight" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-4.htm">1 Samuel 13:4</a>, etc.) And the Hebrew at first sight seems to favour this idea, for it may be rendered literally, they smote <span class="accented">Syria, a hundred thousand, etc</span>. The 100,000 would then represent the entire strength of the Syrian infantry. But the mention of the "footmen" and of "one day" alike suggests that it is of slaughter, not dispersion, that the historian speaks.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:22-30 Those about Benhadad advised him to change his ground. They take it for granted that it was not Israel, but Israel's gods, that beat them; but they speak very ignorantly of Jehovah. They supposed that Israel had many gods, to whom they ascribed limited power within a certain district; thus vain were the Gentiles in their imaginations concerning God. The greatest wisdom in worldly concerns is often united with the most contemptible folly in the things of God.</body></html>
