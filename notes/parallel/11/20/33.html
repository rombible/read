But the general sense seems accurately rendered by our version. "The men watched" ("as for augury," says the LXX.), "and hasted, and caught up" (so as to make it sure) "what fell from him." What follows may be a question, "Is Ben-hadad thy brother?" but probably the simple acceptance of the title is better. The whole description is graphic. The Syrians speak of "thy slave Ben-hadad." Ahab, in compassion or show of magnanimity, says, "my brother." Eagerly the ambassadors catch up the word, which, according to Eastern custom, implied a pledge of amity not to be recalled; and Ahab accepts their inference, and seals it publicly by taking the conquered king into his chariot. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/10-15.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.">2Kings 10:15-16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the men did diligently observe whether anything would come from him and did hastily catch it</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and the men augured -</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5da;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>.

The only difficulty is in the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> which is <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> My.

The law of <span class="accented">dakheet</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> Layard, N. and B. pp. 317-319), by which Rawlinson would explain this incident, seems to be rather an usage of the Bedouin than of any civilized nations]: <span class="cmt_word">and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad.

Have we not found him so? That is gospel repentance, which flows from an apprehension of the mercy of God, in Christ; there is forgiveness with him. What a change is here! The most haughty in prosperity often are most abject in adversity; an evil spirit will thus affect a man in both these conditions. There are those on whom, like Ahab, success is ill bestowed; they know not how to serve either God or their generation, or even their own true interests with their prosperity: Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The prophet designed to reprove Ahab by a parable. If a good prophet were punished for sparing his friend and God's when God said, Smite, of much sorer punishment should a wicked king be thought worthy, who spared his enemy and God's, when God said, Smite. Ahab went to his house, heavy and displeased, not truly penitent, or seeking to undo what he had done amiss; every way out of humour, notwithstanding his victory. Alas! many that hear the glad tidings of Christ, are busy and there till the day of salvation is gone.</body></html>
