The LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">dum ego turbatus hue illucque me verterem</span>, have led some critics to urge the substitution of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="accented">turning</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="accented">looking</span>, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="accented">doing</span>, in the text. But no alteration is needed] <span class="cmt_word">here and there</span> [or <span class="accented">hither and thither</span> - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> is generally <span class="accented">local</span> - as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-20.htm">Joshua 8:20</a>. But sometimes it is merely <span class="accented">demonstrative</span>, "here and there," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-29.htm">Genesis 21:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-5.htm">Daniel 12:5</a>, and so it may be understood here (Gesenius)], <span class="cmt_word">he was gone</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">he is not</span>]. <span class="cmt_word">And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.</span> [Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5-7</a>, Ahab has himself pronounced that his judgment is just, and what it shall be.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:31-43 This encouragement sinners have to repent and humble themselves before God; Have we not heard, that the God of Israel is a merciful God? Have we not found him so? That is gospel repentance, which flows from an apprehension of the mercy of God, in Christ; there is forgiveness with him. What a change is here! The most haughty in prosperity often are most abject in adversity; an evil spirit will thus affect a man in both these conditions. There are those on whom, like Ahab, success is ill bestowed; they know not how to serve either God or their generation, or even their own true interests with their prosperity: Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The prophet designed to reprove Ahab by a parable. If a good prophet were punished for sparing his friend and God's when God said, Smite, of much sorer punishment should a wicked king be thought worthy, who spared his enemy and God's, when God said, Smite. Ahab went to his house, heavy and displeased, not truly penitent, or seeking to undo what he had done amiss; every way out of humour, notwithstanding his victory. Alas! many that hear the glad tidings of Christ, are busy and there till the day of salvation is gone.</body></html>
