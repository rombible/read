"Who shall begin the fray?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the Lord</span> [Observe the repetition. He is careful to give special prominence to the sacred name, as the only help in trouble (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1, 5, 7</a>, etc.)], <span class="cmt_word">Even by the young men</span> [or <span class="accented">servants -</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> has both meanings, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>] <span class="cmt_word">of the princes of the provinces</span>. [The local governors (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>), on the approach of Ben hadad, had apparently fled to the capital. Whether these "young men" were their "pages" (Thenius), or even were "young lads" (Ewald) at all, or, on the contrary, a "select body of strong young men" (Bahr), the bodyguard of the various governors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm">2 Samuel 18:15</a>) (Von Gerlach), may be doubtful; but when Bahr says that Ahab would not have consented to appoint weak boys to lead the van, at least without remonstrance, he must have forgotten that <span class="accented">all</span> the ordinary means at Ahab's disposal were equally insufficient, and that in themselves 200 or 2000 tried veterans would have been just as inadequate a force as 200 pages. The agency by which the victory was won was purposely weak and feeble (<span class="accented">per turbam imbellem</span>), in order that the work might be seen to be of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27, 29</a>). And this consideration makes against the supposition that the attacking body was composed of tried and skilful warriors.] <span class="cmt_word">Then he said, Who shall order</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bind</span>; we speak of "<span class="accented">joining</span> battle"] <span class="cmt_word">the battle?</span> [The meaning is - not, "who shall command this force," but, "which side shall begin the fray?"] <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, Thou</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, thy band of young men shall make the attack.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:12-21 The proud Syrians were beaten, and the despised Israelites were conquerors. The orders of the proud, drunken king disordered his troops, and prevented them from attacking the Israelites. Those that are most secure, are commonly least courageous. Ahab slew the Syrians with a great slaughter. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another.</body></html>
