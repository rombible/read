The reading seems probable; for it will be noticed that in the enumeration the territory of Judah is otherwise altogether omitted. It supplies accordingly here the mention of a special governor, over and above the twelve, for the royal tribe. It has been thought that as Judah was the home province, it was under no other government than that of the king's officers at Jerusalem; but for purposes of revenue it seems hardly likely that it should have been excepted from the general system. Possibly Azariah, who was over the officers residing at the Court, may have been its territorial governor.<p>In some MSS. of the Greek Version, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-27.htm" title="And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.">1Kings 4:27-28</a> immediately follow <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-19.htm" title="Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.">1Kings 4:19</a>, and (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-20.htm" title="Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.">1Kings 4:20-21</a> are omitted) they form a link between <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-7.htm" title="And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.">1Kings 4:7-19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-22.htm" title="And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and three score measures of meal,">1Kings 4:22-23</a>, in a very natural order.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he presided over the parts not already assigned to Bengeber (perhaps his son) and Ahinadab.

And we are hardly justified in translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> "he was the first (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, superior), officer" (set over those mentioned above, vers. 13, 14), as Schulze. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> used as an ordinal number, but it is only in connexion with days and years (Gesen. s.v.) Some, following the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>) would detach Judah from ver. 20, where it must be allowed it occurs with a suspicious abruptness, and where the absence of the copula, so usual in the Hebrew, suggests a corruption of the text, and would connect it with this verse, which would then yield the sense, "and he was," (or "there was") "one officer which purveyed in the land of Judah." it is to be observed, however, that though no mention has as yet been made of Judah in any of the districts, yet the prefecture of Ben Hesed (ver. 10) appears to have extended over this tribe, and the remark consequently seems superfluous. (Can it be the object of the writer to show that the royal tribe was not favoured or exempted from contributing its share?) On the whole, the difficulty would seem still to await a solution. We can hardly, in the teeth of ver. 7, suppose with Ewald, <span class="accented">al.</span> that a <span class="accented">thirteenth</span> officer is here intended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 4:20-34. SOLOMON'S RULE, STATE, AND WISDOM. - The remainder of this chapter, which de-scribes to us the extent and character of Solomon's sway (vv. 20, 21, 24, 25), the pomp and provision of his household (vv. 22, 23, 26-28), and his profound and varied wisdom (vv. 29-34), has every appearance of a compilation from different sources. It scarcely has the order and coherence which we should find in the narrative of a single writer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-19 In the choice of the great officers of Solomon's court, no doubt, his wisdom appeared. Several are the same that were in his father's time. A plan was settled by which no part of the country was exhausted to supply his court, though each sent its portion.</body></html>
