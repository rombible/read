The name is elsewhere given as <span class= "ital">Adoram. </span>It is to be noticed that in the enumeration of David's officers in the early part of the reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/8-16.htm" title="And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;">2Samuel 8:16-18</a>)<span class= "ital"> no </span>such officer is found; but that in the latter part of his reign the list contains the name of Adoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-24.htm" title="And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:">2Samuel 20:24</a>). It has been thought that the numbering of the people recorded in 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21, was in preparation for such forced work, and hence was odious to Joab and others. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-18.htm" title="Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.">1Kings 12:18</a> we read how the holder of this office, being naturally most unpopular with those who had felt the burden of Solomon's splendour, was stoned to death in the insurrection against Rehoboam.<p>To this list the Greek Version adds: "Eliab the son of Shaphat was over the body-guard." As the office of captain of the body-guard is found in the other lists, and is too important to be omitted, it is possible that this addition corrects some defect in the Hebrew text. Yet it is also possible that no successor to Benaiah was appointed, as experience had shown, in the crushing of the rebellion of Adonijah, how easily the captaincy of the body-guard might become a quasi-independent power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahishar was over the household</span> [steward and manager of the palace.
