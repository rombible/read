<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a>;

Of these "men of the east," Job is expressly said to be one, and among the chief (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm" title="His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.">Job 1:3</a>), What their wisdom was, the utterances of Job and his friends may testify, showing as they do large knowledge of nature and of man, speculating on the deepest moral questions, and throughout resting, though with an awe greater than was felt within the circle of the Abrahamic covenant, upon the consciousness of the one God. The Book of Job also shows that this wisdom was not unconnected with the proverbial "wisdom of Egypt," with which it is here joined. The Egyptian wisdom (as the monuments show) was a part of a more advanced and elaborate civilisation, enriched by learning and culture, and manifesting itself in art and science, but perhaps less free and vigorous than the simpler patriarchal wisdom of the children of the east.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon's wisdom excelled</span> [or exceeded; same word as in ver. 29] <span class="cmt_word">the wisdom of all the children of the east country</span> [By the <span class="accented">Beni-Kedem</span> we are hardly to understand (with Rawlinson) a distinct tribe on the banks of the Euphrates. It is true that the land of the Beni-Kedem is identified with Haran or Mesopotamia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>), and the mountains of Kedem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>) are evidently those of Aram. It is also true that "the children of the East" are apparently distinguished from the Amalekites and Midianites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-8.htm">Judges 6:8, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10</a>). It is probable, nevertheless, that the name is here employed to designate all the Arabian tribes east and southeast of Palestine - Sabaeans, Idumeans, Temanites, Chaldeans. What their wisdom was like, we may see in the Book of Job. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>] <span class="cmt_word">and all the wisdom of Egypt.</span> [The learning of Egypt was of great repute in the Old World.

He had what is here called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for the powers of the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. It is very desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, should have large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures of wisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that is needful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There came persons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than their neighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hid for us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom. Christ's fame shall spread through all the earth, and men of all nations shall come to him, learn of him, and take upon them his easy yoke, and find rest for their souls.</body></html>
