(See, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10, 11</a>.) The truth seems to be, not that "the expression belonged to the time of the captivity, but was retained after the return and without regard to its geographical signification, just, for instance, like the expression, <span class="accented">Gallia Trans-alpina"</span> (Bahr), but that from the first it was employed, now of one side, now of the other, of the Jordan; of the west in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1</a>, etc.; of the east in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-32.htm">Numbers 32:32</a>; "and even in the same chapter is used first of one and then of the other <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8, 20, 25</a>" (Spk.

See Introduction, sect. 5.] <span class="cmt_word">from Tiphsah</span> [cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>, apparently the town on the west bank of the Euphrates, known to the Greeks as Thapsacus.

The objection of Thenius that this statement contradicts that of ch. 11:23, sqq., is hardly deserving of serious notice. The reign of Solomon, on the whole, was undoubtedly a peaceful one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:20-28 Never did the crown of Israel shine so bright, as when Solomon wore it. He had peace on all sides. Herein, his kingdom was a type of the Messiah's; for to Him it is promised that he shall have the heathen for his inheritance, and that princes shall worship him. The spiritual peace, and joy, and holy security, of all the faithful subjects of the Lord Jesus, were typified by that of Israel. The kingdom of God is not, as Solomon's was, meat and drink, but, what is infinitely better, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The vast number of his attendants, and the great resort to him, are shown by the provision daily made. Herein Christ far outdoes Solomon, that he feeds all his subjects, not with the bread that perishes, but with that which endures to eternal life.</body></html>
