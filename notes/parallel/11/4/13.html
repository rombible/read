So Gesenius, who cites <span class="accented">Eisleben</span> and similar names] <span class="cmt_word">the son Manasseh</span> [it is doubtful whether the judge of that name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3</a>) or Jair, the son of Segub (called a "son of Manasseh" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>, because his grandmother was a daughter of the great Machir, though his father belonged to Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21</a>), is intended. Probably it is the latter. (They can hardly be one and the same person, though they are often identified, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the Speaker's Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3</a>. But they belong to different periods.) Curiously enough, the Havoth Jair are mentioned in connexion with each (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4, 5, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>), but in every ease except the last the reference is to the son of Segub.

The latter consisted of threescore cities, with walls, gates, and bars. This remarkable district, twenty-two miles in length by fourteen in breadth, is "wholly composed of black basalt, which appears to have issued from innumerable pores in the earth in a liquid state .... Before cooling, its surface was violently agitated, and it was afterwards shattered and rent by convulsions .... Strange as it may seem, this ungainly and forbidding region is thickly studded with deserted cities and villages" (Porter, "Giant Cities of Bashan," also in Kitto's <span class="accented">Cycl.</span> 3. p. 1032; Dict.
