whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 9:25</a>, and with the notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm" title="And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.">1Kings 10:26</a> (one thousand four hundred), it seems clear that for "forty thousand" "four thousand" should be read. They were kept in various "chariot cities," as well as at Jerusalem. This multiplication of horses and horsemen--forbidden to the future king in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, but foretold by Samuel at the inauguration of the kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.">1Samuel 8:11-12</a>)--is significant of military conquest and an extended empire. The Israelite armies, in frequent contradistinction from their enemies, had been hitherto mainly of infantry; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-9.htm" title="And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:9</a> the chariots and horses captured were not used, but destroyed, "as the Lord bade Joshua." Such armies were powerful for defence, not for invasion. Now, as it would seem for the first time, this provision of the ancient law, like many others, was set aside, and Solomon's empire assumed the character of other great Oriental monarchies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses</span> [40,000 is certainly a clerical error, probably for 4000 (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the parallel passage in Chronicles the number is stated as 4000. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> 4000 agrees, and 40,000 does not, with the other numbers here given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The chariots, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, numbered 1400; the horsemen 12,000. Now for 1400 chariots the proper allowance of horses would be about 4000. We see from the monuments that it was customary to yoke two horses (seldom three) to a chariot; but a third or supernumerary horse was provided to meet emergencies or accidents. 4000 horses would hence be a liberal provision for Solomon's chariots, and it would also agree well with the number of his cavalry. 12,000 cavalry and 40,000 chariot horses are out of all proportion. As to stalls, it seems clear that in ancient, as in modern times, each horse had a separate crib (Vegetins in Bochart, quoted by Keil). Gesenius, however, understands by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, not <span class="accented">stalls</span>, but <span class="accented">teams</span>, or <span class="accented">pairs</span>] <span class="cmt_word">for his chariots</span> [or <span class="accented">chariotry</span>: the word is singular and collective] <span class="cmt_word">and twelve hundred horsemen</span> [rather, <span class="accented">horses, i.e.</span>, riding or cavalry, as distinguished from chariot horses above. See note on 1 Kings 1:5. It has been supposed that this warlike provision is mentioned to account for the peace ("<span class="accented">si vis pacem, para bellum"</span>) of Solomon's reign, and was designed to overawe the tributary kings. But it is more probable that the idea of the historian was, partly to exhibit the pomp and circumstance of Israel's greatest king, and partly to record a contravention of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>), which was one of the precursors of his fall]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:20-28 Never did the crown of Israel shine so bright, as when Solomon wore it. He had peace on all sides. Herein, his kingdom was a type of the Messiah's; for to Him it is promised that he shall have the heathen for his inheritance, and that princes shall worship him. The spiritual peace, and joy, and holy security, of all the faithful subjects of the Lord Jesus, were typified by that of Israel. The kingdom of God is not, as Solomon's was, meat and drink, but, what is infinitely better, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The vast number of his attendants, and the great resort to him, are shown by the provision daily made. Herein Christ far outdoes Solomon, that he feeds all his subjects, not with the bread that perishes, but with that which endures to eternal life.</body></html>
