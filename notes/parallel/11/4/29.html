The "wisdom of God" (see, for example, Proverbs 8) is, in relation to man, His Divine purpose in the creation and government of the world, which all things work out. The "wisdom of man" is the knowledge of the true end and object of his own being--which if he fulfil not, it were better for him not to have been born--whether that object be called happiness or perfection. For such knowledge the Book of Ecclesiastes describes a vain search. Such knowledge, as found already, is embodied in the Proverbs; sometimes in the lowest sense of knowledge of what will conduce to our own happiness; sometimes in the higher knowledge of what will best serve man; most often in the supreme knowledge, how we may best do God's will and show forth His glory. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) But, since the purpose of our own being cannot be discovered, if our life be regarded as isolated from the history of the world and from its great design, this wisdom in man is regarded as possible, only when he has some glimpse of the wisdom of God, as manifested to man in His visible Providence, in His declared law, and His special revelation to the soul. Hence, "the fear of the Lord" is its "beginning;" and faith in God is the supplement of its necessary imperfection. (<span class= "ital">c</span>)<span class= "ital">It </span>will be obvious that, even so considered, this desire for wisdom is more self-contained and self-conscious than "the thirst for God, even the living God," in which the soul of the Psalmist expresses absolute dependence on God. If the sense of the need of God's revelation and of the necessity of faith beyond knowledge be lost, then this consciousness of wisdom may well become a self-idolatry, in which the mind prides itself on having pierced to the secret of being, holds that by such knowledge it becomes superior to ordinary law and duty, and delights in philosophical contemplation, rather than in active energy and religious devotion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God gave Solomon</span> [in fulfilment of the promise of chap. 3:12] wisdom and understanding (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">wisdom, knowledge</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="accented">discernment, penetration.</span> The historian, after describing the prosperity of the realm, proceeds to speak of the personal endowments of its head] and largeness of heart exceeding much [the Easterns speak of the heart where we should talk of head or intellect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>.

He had what is here called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for the powers of the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. It is very desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, should have large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures of wisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that is needful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There came persons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than their neighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hid for us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom. Christ's fame shall spread through all the earth, and men of all nations shall come to him, learn of him, and take upon them his easy yoke, and find rest for their souls.</body></html>
