The word is derived from a root which means to "set in order." It is significant that whereas in the lists of David's officers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/8-16.htm" title="And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;">2Samuel 8:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/20-23.htm" title="Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:">2Samuel 20:23-26</a>, the captain of the host stands first, and is followed in one list by the captain of the body-guard, both are here preceded by the peaceful offices of the priests, scribes, and the recorder.<p><span class= "bld">Azariah the son of Zadok the priest.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-9.htm" title="And Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,">1Chronicles 6:9-10</a>, we find Azariah described as the son of Ahimaaz, and so grandson of Zadok; and the note in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-10.htm" title="The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:">1Kings 4:10</a> (which is apparently out of its right place) seems to show that he was high priest at the time when the Temple was built. The title the "priest" in this place must be given by anticipation, for it is expressly said below that "Zadok and Abiathar were now the priests." The use of the original word, <span class= "ital">Cohen </span>(probably signifying "one who ministers"), appears sometimes to retain traces of the old times, when the priesthood and headship of the family were united, and to be applied accordingly to princes, to whom perhaps still attached something of the ancient privilege. Thus it is given to the sons of David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2Samuel 8:18</a>, where the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1Chronicles 18:17</a> has a paraphrase, "chief about the king," evidently intended to explain the sense in which it is used in the older record. We may remember that David himself on occasions wore the priestly ephod (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2Samuel 6:14</a>). Possibly in this sense it is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:">1Kings 4:5</a> to Zabud, the "king's friend" (where the Authorised Version renders it by <span class= "ital">"</span>principal officer"). But in this verse there is every reason for taking it in the usual sense. Azariah was already a "prince" before he succeeded to the high priesthood. The mingling, of priestly and princely functions is characteristic of the time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these were the princes</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> ministers, officers.

First, to whom does the <span class="accented">title</span> "priest" here belong, to Azariah or to Zadok? Second, what are we to understand by the <span class="accented">term</span>, a spiritual, or a more or less secular <span class="accented">person -</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>? As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> the Vulgate (<span class="accented">sacerdotis</span>) and apparently the Authorized Version, with the Rabbins, Luther, and many later expounders, connect the title with Zadok (who is mentioned as priest in ver. 4), and understand that Azariah, the son of the high priest Zadok, was, together with the sons of Shisha, one of the scribes (ver. 3). It is true that this view obviates some difficulties, but against it are these considerations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The accents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Chaldee and LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> Cod. Alex.; Cod.

The question is one of some nicety, but the balance of evidence is distinctly in favour of connecting the title with Azariah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Azariah son of Zadok was the priest." This brings us to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> What are we to understand by "the priest " - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>? It is urged by Keil, Bahr, <span class="accented">al.</span> that this cannot mean "priest" in the ordinary sense of the word, still less "high priest," for the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Because the high priests of Solomon are mentioned presently, viz., Abiathar and Zadok, and the Jews never had <span class="accented">three</span> high priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Because the Azariah who was high priest under Solomon for the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a>, "He it is that executed the priest's office," etc, must belong to the Azariah of ver. 9, and have got accidentally misplaced - was the son of Ahimaaz, not of Zadok. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because no grandson of Zadok could then be old enough to sustain the office of high priest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Because in one passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>) <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is used of privy councillors and of the sons of <span class="accented">David</span>, who cannot have been sacrificing priests. Keil consequently would understand that Azariah was "administrator of the kingdom, or prime minister." Similarly Bahr. But in favour of the ordinary meaning of the word are these powerful considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> All the versions translate the word by "priest," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they understand by the term a spiritual person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Whatever may be the case with <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> priest" (<span class="accented">par excellence</span>) can only be understood of the <span class="accented">high</span> priest (ch. 1:8, 38; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-21.htm">Leviticus 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4, 8, 10, 12, 14</a>. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is extremely doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is ever used except in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, Rawlinson, who says it sometimes indicates "a civil officer, with perhaps a semi-priestly character," refers to Gesenius <span class="accented">sub hac voce</span>, who, however, distinctly affirms that the word only means priest, and accounts for the application of the term to the sons of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>) on the supposition that the Jews had priests who were not of the tribe of Levi. The question is discussed with great learning by Professor Plumptre (Dict. Bib., art. "Priest"), who suggests that "David and his sons may have been admitted, not to distinctively priestly functions, such as burning incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>), but to an honorary, titular priesthood. To wear the ephod in processions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>) at the time when this was the special badge of the order (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>), to join the priests and Levites in their songs and dances, might have been conceded, with no deviation from the Law, to the members of the royal house." There is one difficulty however in the way of accepting this ingenious and otherwise sufficient explanation, namely, that it seems hardly likely that the title of priest would be freely accorded by Hebrew writers to men who were expressly <span class="accented">excluded</span> from all "distinctively priestly functions," especially after the use of the same word in the preceding verse (17) to designate the high priest. And I venture to suggest that the discharge by David's sons of the semi-priestly functions just referred to occasioned so much remark as to head to the application of the term "priest" to them in a special conventional sense; in fact, that it became a sort of <span class="accented">soubriquet</span>, which rather implied that they were <span class="accented">not</span> priests than that they were. (Notice <span class="accented">the order</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, Hebrews) And observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> if we are to understand by "the <span class="accented">priest"</span> in ver. 2, "prime minister;" by <span class="accented">"priests"</span> in ver. 4, "high priests," and by <span class="accented">"priest"</span> in ver 5, "principal officer," language has no certain meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The mention of Azariah as "the priest" in the same list with Zadok and Abiathar is easily accounted for. We know that Abiathar was deposed at the beginning of Solomon's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27</a>), and Zadok must then have been an old man. Their names consequently are  recorded (ver. 4) because they were high priests for a brief period of the reign, but Azariah is mentioned first as "the priest" because he was high priest during most of the time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> "Azariah the <span class="accented">son</span> of Zadok" is quite compatible with the fact that Azariah was really the son of Ahimaaz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is constantly used in the sense of "descendant," and especially "grandson." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-5.htm">Genesis 29:5</a>: 31:28, 55: and see on ch. 2:8,"the son of Gera.") Zadok is no doubt mentioned as better known than Ahimaaz, and probably because Azariah succeeded him directly in the office. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The age of Azariah must be uncertain, and Solomon's reign was a long one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The position of his name - first - accords well with the idea that he was high priest, which I conclude that he was. It is worthy of remark that in the lists of David the military officers of the kingdom occupy the first place; in those of Solomon, the civil and religious dignitaries. "The princes of Solomon are, with one exception (ver. 4) ministers of peace." - Wordsworth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-19 In the choice of the great officers of Solomon's court, no doubt, his wisdom appeared. Several are the same that were in his father's time. A plan was settled by which no part of the country was exhausted to supply his court, though each sent its portion.</body></html>
