It does not seem to have occurred to the prophet that such a calamity as he had denounced against the country almost made his disappearance from the scene a necessity, or if it did, he still waited for instructions. Cf. ver. 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>, etc. Not merely was his flight necessary in order to escape persecution or punishment - the search which Ahab instituted for him in part explains his disappearance - but to avoid importunity. It would have been morally impossible for him, though a man of inflexible will (Bahr) to dwell among the people, while the land groaned under the terrible burden which he had laid upon it, and which he alone was able to remove. His life would not have been safe - see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a> - and the ordeal would have been intolerable. And <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a> shows that the prophet's nature had its weaker side. Wordsworth observes that Elijah's escapes and departures into unknown places are "faint resemblances of the mysterious vanishings of our blessed Lord, after He had delivered some of His Divine messages which excited the anger of the people;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-29.htm">Luke 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-39.htm">John 10:39</a>] by [Heb. in] <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">brook</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e., watercourse, wady</span>. This word has two meanings. Its primary meaning is <span class="accented">torrent</span>; its secondary and, from the fact that the torrents of the East are for the most part dried up during the greater part of the year, its common meaning is <span class="accented">torrent-bed</span>, or ravine, valley. Both meanings are brought out here. Elijah should <span class="accented">dwell in and drink of the</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3</a>] <span class="cmt_word">Cherith</span> [The word means <span class="accented">separation</span>, a name which may possibly indicate that it was extremely secluded, or it may have been a boundary line of some sort. Tradition identifies the brook Cherith with the <span class="accented">Wady-et-kelt, i.e.</span>, the great valley, west of the <span class="accented">Jordan</span>, which debouches into the Ghor, half a mile south of Jericho, and Robinson and Porter pronounce in its favour. Van de Velde (2. 310, 311) suggests the <span class="accented">Wady Fasael, a</span> few miles to the north. But it is much more probable that it is to be sought in the region east of the Jordan, where, indeed, Eusebius and Jerome place it. It is extremely doubtful whether the Wady-el-kelt, or any Cis-Jordanic ravine, would afford sufficient privacy. Probably Jericho was already rebuilt. As we cannot decide with certainty, we may reasonably conjecture that it is to be sought in Elijah's own country of Gilead, and probably in the <span class="accented">Waddy Alias, i.e.</span>, at no great distance from <span class="accented">Abara</span> (Conder, "Tent-work," p. 230), the Jordan ford nearly opposite Bethshan, where, indeed, an old tradition places it] <span class="cmt_word">that is before</span> [Nothing positive can be concluded from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>.

But this meaning is gathered from the context] <span class="cmt_word">Jordan</span>. [The Cherith was clearly one of the lateral valleys which run into the Ghor. It is just possible that the name may be recovered by the survey of the country east of the Jordan, which is now (1880) being organized.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 God wonderfully suits men to the work he designs them for. The times were fit for an Elijah; an Elijah was fit for them. The Spirit of the Lord knows how to fit men for the occasions. Elijah let Ahab know that God was displeased with the idolaters, and would chastise them by the want of rain, which it was not in the power of the gods they served to bestow. Elijah was commanded to hide himself. If Providence calls us to solitude and retirement, it becomes us to go: when we cannot be useful, we must be patient; and when we cannot work for God, we must sit still quietly for him. The ravens were appointed to bring him meat, and did so. Let those who have but from hand to mouth, learn to live upon Providence, and trust it for the bread of the day, in the day. God could have sent angels to minister to him; but he chose to show that he can serve his own purposes by the meanest creatures, as effectually as by the mightiest. Elijah seems to have continued thus above a year. The natural supply of water, which came by common providence, failed; but the miraculous supply of food, made sure to him by promise, failed not. If the heavens fail, the earth fails of course; such are all our creature-comforts: we lose them when we most need them, like brooks in summer. But there is a river which makes glad the city of God, that never runs dry, a well of water that springs up to eternal life. Lord, give us that living water!</body></html>
