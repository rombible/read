The singularly prosaic interpretations, substituted for this striking and significant record of miracle by some ancient and modern writers (adopting slight variations of the Hebrew vowel points)--such as "Arabs," "merchants," "inhabitants of a city Orbi or the rock Oreb"--seem to have arisen simply from a desire to get rid of what seemed a strange miracle, at the cost (be it observed) of substituting for it a gross improbability; for how can it be supposed that such regular sustenance by human hands of the persecuted prophet could have gone on in the face of the jealous vigilance of the king? But it is idle to seek to explain away one wonder in a life and an epoch teeming with miracles. It is notable, indeed, that the critical period of the great Baal apostasy, and of the struggle of Elijah and Elisha against it, is the second great epoch of recorded miracle in the Old Testament--the still more critical epoch of Moses and Joshua being the first. It is hardly less idle to determine that this or that miracle is so improbable, as to introduce any difficulty of acceptance which does not apply to miracles in general.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook</span> [There was clearly nothing miraculous about the supply of <span class="accented">water</span>.

In support of the received rendering is the very powerful consideration, that it is the interpretation of all the versions (except the Arabic) and of Josephus, who, beyond all question, represented the belief current in his own time (Ant. 8:13. 2). It is also certain that elsewhere in Scripture we find some of the inferior animals supernaturally constrained to effect God's purposes, both of mercy and of judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-24.htm">2 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a>), though never it must be said, in so rational and methodical a way. Nor can it rightly be contended that the words "I have commanded," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, imply human agency, for elsewhere we find the Almighty <span class="accented">commanding</span> (same word) the serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>) and the clouds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23</a>). It is not, however, a sufficient account of this narrative to say that the prophet merely helped himself to the food which the ravens, whose <span class="accented">habitat</span> was in the Wady Cherith, brought, day by day, to their nests and their young. For, not to insist on the words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">bringing to him</span> (ver. 6), the expressions '" bread (or <span class="accented">food</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) and flesh," and "morning and evening" certainly point to something more than such a fortuitous supply. Whether the <span class="accented">Orebim</span> were "ravens" or not, they certainly acted in an intelligent and rational way: they brought food, that is to say, to the <span class="accented">prophet</span>, and they brought it for months together with unfailing regularity. But against this view the following considerations may be urged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It is hardly in accord with God's <span class="accented">usual</span> way of working, that he should employ birds of the air and those unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:14</a>) and ravenous birds, to feed and succour His saints, rather than men or angels. Of course, no one who does not altogether repudiate the supernatural will deny for a moment that the Almighty <span class="accented">could, had</span> it seemed good to Him, have sustained His prophet by the instrumentality of ravens, just as easily as by any other means. But it appears to be almost a fixed principle of His dealings with men, not to resort to miracles when ordinary means will suffice; or if He does employ miracles, they are never <span class="accented">bizarre</span> or fantastic; they are not such as to suggest the idea of fable or legend; they are invariably the simplest and directest means to the end. And it is submitted that this prolonged and methodical ministry of ravens is altogether unlike God's method of procedure on other occasions. It was an angel succoured Hagar and Ishmael in their need (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>). It was an angel fed Elijah himself, a few years later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5, 6</a>). They were angels who ministered to our blessed Lord after His long fast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>). But God's,' chief means," it is always to be remembered, "is man." And it is to be carefully observed that when, about this very time, not one, but one hundred prophets were threatened, just as Elijah was, with death, <span class="cmt_word">no</span> miracle was wrought to save their lives or to supply their wants, but they were fed by human agency, with bread and water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>). But it is still more significant that elsewhere in this narrative, which is characterized by the profoundest sobriety and reticence, there is what we may almost call a studied absence of the miraculous element. No miracle is wrought to protect Elijah against Jezebel, but he must consult for his own safety by flight. He is sent to the brook Cherith, because there is <span class="accented">water</span> there; in other words, God chose that hiding place in order to obviate the necessity for a miracle. And when the water of the brook dries up, no miracle is wrought to prolong the supply, but the prophet, at the risk of detection, must go forth and seek it elsewhere. And at Zarephath he is fed, not by ravens, but by human agency - by a widow woman. It is true a miracle appears to have been wrought, but the narrative has so little idea of effect and gives so little prominence to the supernatural that even that is doubted. To put the interpretation of "ravens," consequently, on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, provided it will yield any other meaning, appears to be to do violence to the spirit of the context, and to the tenour of Scripture generally. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is somewhat difficult to believe that such a prodigy as this, so altogether unique and irregular, would not have been mentioned, had it really happened, elsewhere in Scripture. The absence of all reference thereto is remarkable, when we consider how constantly the ministry of Elijah and its lessons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5, 6</a>) are referred to in the New Testament; but when we observe what an admirable and unequalled illustration of God's providential care this incident would have supplied to some of our Lord's discourses, and notably to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-22.htm">Luke 12:22</a> sqq., this silence becomes almost suspicious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Despite the practical unanimity of the versions, the interpretation "ravens" has been disputed from very early times. St. Jerome among Christians, Rabbi Judah Hakkodesh and Kimchi amongst Jews - these are but some of those who have repudiated this rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> A very slight change in the vowel points - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - yields the meaning "Arabians." That a fugitive would readily find, not only shelter but sustenance among the Bedouin, whose generous hospitality and loyalty to strangers is proverbial, is obvious, and we knew that about this time some Arab tribes had dealings with the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>); but without any change at all, a sufficient meaning may be extracted from the word. For we find that somewhere in the <span class="accented">Ciccar</span>, or plain of the Jordan, off which the Wady Cherith lay, was a rock Oreb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>), apparently east of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>), but in any case, at no great distance from Bethabara (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>). Now Beth-abara has been identified, almost to a certainty (Conder, "Tent-work," pp. 229-232) with the modern <span class="accented">Abarah</span> (<span class="accented">i.e., passage</span> or <span class="accented">ferry</span>), "one of the main fords of the Jordan just above the place where the Jalud river flowing down the valley of Jezreel and <span class="accented">by Beisan</span>, debouches into Jordan." But we learn from an ancient and independent source, the <span class="accented">Bereshith Rabba</span> (see Dict. Bib. ii. 464), that in the neighbourhood of <span class="accented">Beisan, i.e.</span>, Bethshean, there was anciently a town named <span class="accented">Orbo</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> - a word, it is to be observed, which preserves the radicals of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> transposed. We may safely assume that these two places, Orbo and Oreb, were identical; that the former was the representative at a later day of the latter, or was the shape which the name assumed when bestowed on the hamlet, as distinct from the rock. The inhabitants of this place would, of course, be called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, just as the in. habitants of Ziph were known as <span class="accented">Ziphim</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-1.htm">1 Samuel 26:1</a>), or the men of Zidon as <span class="accented">Zidonim</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). We find, consequently, that this word, which means "ravens," also designates the inhabitants of a village near Bethshean, and probably east of the Jordan; that is to say, in or near Elijah's native country of Gilead. And with this agree the testimonies of Rabbi Judah and Jerome already referred to. The former held that the <span class="accented">Orebim</span> were not ravens at all, but inhabitants of Orbo or the rock Oreb, while the latter says, with equal positiveness, <span class="accented">Orbim, accolae villae in fini-bus Arabum, Eliae dederunt alimenta</span>. It only remains for us to notice the perfect naturalness and consistency of the narrative thus interpreted. Elijah is bidden to go <span class="accented">eastward</span>; to hide in the Wady Cherith, where he would be among tribesmen or friends. For water, there is the brook; for food, the Orbites, whose name would be familiar to him, and whom he may have known, are commanded to feed him. He goes; he is received with Arab hospitality; the Eastern law of <span class="accented">Dakheel</span>, by which any man at any time is entitled to throw himself upon the mercy and protection of another, ensures his safety. The Orebim minister assiduously to his wants. Every morning before the dawn, every evening after dark, they bring him bread and flesh.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 God wonderfully suits men to the work he designs them for. The times were fit for an Elijah; an Elijah was fit for them. The Spirit of the Lord knows how to fit men for the occasions. Elijah let Ahab know that God was displeased with the idolaters, and would chastise them by the want of rain, which it was not in the power of the gods they served to bestow. Elijah was commanded to hide himself. If Providence calls us to solitude and retirement, it becomes us to go: when we cannot be useful, we must be patient; and when we cannot work for God, we must sit still quietly for him. The ravens were appointed to bring him meat, and did so. Let those who have but from hand to mouth, learn to live upon Providence, and trust it for the bread of the day, in the day. God could have sent angels to minister to him; but he chose to show that he can serve his own purposes by the meanest creatures, as effectually as by the mightiest. Elijah seems to have continued thus above a year. The natural supply of water, which came by common providence, failed; but the miraculous supply of food, made sure to him by promise, failed not. If the heavens fail, the earth fails of course; such are all our creature-comforts: we lose them when we most need them, like brooks in summer. But there is a river which makes glad the city of God, that never runs dry, a well of water that springs up to eternal life. Lord, give us that living water!</body></html>
