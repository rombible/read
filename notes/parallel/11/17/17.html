Keil thinks it perfectly clear that it does. Bahr is as firmly persuaded that it does not.

To this it may be added that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> simply means <span class="accented">breath</span>, and that where it is desired to convey the idea of <span class="accented">rife</span>, additional words are used (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, "the <span class="accented">breath</span> of life; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-22.htm">Genesis 7:22</a>, "the <span class="accented">breath</span> of the spirit of <span class="accented">life</span>." <span class="accented">C</span>f. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-3.htm">Job 27:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27</a> (where the intelligence or reason appears to be meant), <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>. It must be confessed also that the statement, "his sickness was so sore," etc., is quite <span class="accented">apropos</span> and intelligible, if we may understand that he lay in a state of coma, but would be an extremely roundabout way of affirming that he was dead. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:17-24 Neither faith nor obedience shut out afflictions and death. The child being dead, the mother spake to the prophet, rather to give vent to her sorrow, than in hope of relief. When God removes our comforts from us, he remembers our sins against us, perhaps the sins of our youth, though long since past. When God remembers our sins against us, he designs to teach us to remember them against ourselves, and to repent of them. Elijah's prayer was doubtless directed by the Holy Spirit. The child revived. See the power of prayer, and the power of Him who hears prayer.</body></html>
