First, in this instance, as in the similar miracles of Elisha and of our Lord Himself, we see that God's higher laws of miracle, like the ordinary laws of His providence, admit within their scope the supply of what we should consider as homely and trivial needs--in this respect perhaps contradicting what our expectation would have suggested. Next, that it is a miracle of multiplication, which is virtual creation--not necessarily out of nothing--doing rapidly and directly what, under ordinary laws, has to be done slowly and by indirect process.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah</span> [the echo of ver. 13, "Go and <span class="accented">do according to thy saying"</span>]: and she, and he, [or <span class="accented">he and she</span>, according to Chethib] <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">her house</span> [probably her friends or poor relatives who came to partake of her plenty (Bahr)], <span class="cmt_word">did eat many days.</span> [Heb. days, <span class="accented">i.e., an</span> indefinite period. See note on ver. 7. The word does not refer to the first baking (ver. 13), but it is to be explained by the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8-16 Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, and some, it is likely, would have bidden him welcome to their houses; yet he is sent to honour and bless with his presence a city of Sidon, a Gentile city, and so becomes the first prophet of the Gentiles. Jezebel was Elijah's greatest enemy; yet, to show her how powerless was her malice, God will find a hiding-place for him even in her own country. The person appointed to entertain Elijah is not one of the rich or great men of Sidon; but a poor widow woman, in want, and desolate, is made both able and willing to sustain him. It is God's way, and it is his glory, to make use of, and put honour upon, the weak and foolish things of the world. O woman, great was thy faith; one has not found the like, no not in Israel. She took the prophet's word, that she should not lose by it. Those who can venture upon the promise of God, will make no difficulty to expose and empty themselves in his service, by giving him his part first. Surely the increase of this widow's faith, so as to enable her thus readily to deny herself, and to depend upon the Divine promise, was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the increase of her meal and oil in the kingdom of providence. Happy are all who can thus, against hope, believe and obey in hope. One poor meal's meat this poor widow gave the prophet; in recompence of it, she and her son did eat above two years, in a time of famine. To have food from God's special favour, and in such good company as Elijah, made it more than doubly sweet. It is promised to those who trust in God, that they shall not be ashamed in evil time; in days of famine they shall be satisfied.</body></html>
