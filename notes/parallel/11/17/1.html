The word here rendered "inhabitants" (properly "sojourners") is evidently of the same derivation as the word rendered "Tishbite." The only alternative would be to render "the stranger of the strangers of Gilead," which has been adopted by some, as suggesting a startling and impressive origin of the great prophet. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear it.<span class= "bld"><p>Gilead</span>--properly "the rocky region" that lay on the east of Jordan, between the Hieromax and the valley of Heshbon (although the name is often more widely used). Open to the desert on the east, and itself comparatively wild, with but few cities scattered through it, it suited well the recluse dweller in the wilderness.<span class= "bld"><p>The Lord God of Israel before whom I stand.</span>--This adjuration (repeated in 18:15, and with some alteration by Elisha in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm" title="And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.">2Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-16.htm" title="But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.">2Kings 5:16</a>) is characteristic. Elijah is the servant of God standing to be sent whither He wills.<p>This is evidently not the first appearance of Elijah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">James 5:17</a>, the withholding of rain, foretold again and again as a penalty on apostasy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm" title="And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:">Leviticus 26:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm" title="And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-35.htm" title="When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:">1Kings 8:35</a>), is noted as an answer to the prophet's prayer, calling down judgment on the land. Evidently there had been a struggle against the Baal-worship of the time, and, no doubt, previous warnings from Elijah or from some one of the murdered prophets. This chapter introduces us suddenly to the catastrophe.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elijah</span> [This name, which appears both as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and, less frequently, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, means <span class="accented">my God is Jehovah</span>. It is so singularly appropriate to the man who bore it, and so exactly expresses the idea of his life and the chapter of his work (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>), that it is difficult to resist the belief that it was assumed by him. This is certainly more probable than that it was due to the prescience of his parents. It may, however, mark their piety and hopes, and may have influenced the life of their son. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-10.htm">1 Chronicles 4:10</a>]<span class="cmt_word">, the Tishbite</span> [So he is called without any further designation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-17.htm">1 Kings 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8, 8</a>, etc. The presumption is altogether in favour of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> being the name of his birthplace. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29</a>]<span class="cmt_word">, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead</span> [The interpretation of these words is much disputed.

But it is by no certain that the current interpretaioni not the best. Such a play upon words as it involves is not at all uncommon in Hebrew. The meaning would then be that Elijah , who was, if not by birth, by domicile, of Tishbe, was one of the strangers - <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span> is found in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">inquilinus</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-4.htm">Genesis 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-45.htm">Exodus 12:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35, 47</a>, etc. - or immigrants who had settled in Gilead. The only objection to this rendering - apart from the identity of radicals just <span class="accented">mentioned -</span> is that we should have expected to find <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> written <span class="accented">plene</span>, as the word always is elsewhere.

It is clear, then, that the usual <span class="accented">interpretation is</span> by no <span class="accented">means</span> to be lightly set aside. It is certainly preferable to the rendering, "Elijah the stranger," etc., for we have no proof that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> can bear this meaning. In favour of the alternative rendering "the Tishbite of Tishbe," it may be said that it has the support of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and of Josephus (Ant. 8:13. 2), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Nor is it any weighty objection to this view that we now here read of a Tishbe in Gilead: as for the matter of that, we have no undoubted traces of any such place <span class="accented">west</span> of the Jordan; the passage in Tobit (ch. 1:2, LXX.), which is often alleged as proving that there was a Tishbe in Galilee, and from which Gesenius, Bahr, Keil, etc., <span class="accented">conclude</span> that this must be the Tishbi here referred to, being too uncertain to permit us to build any positive conclusions thereupon. See Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1489, 1516. In any case - and it is <span class="accented">perhaps impossible</span> to decide positively between this and the rendering of the A.V. - it is clear that Elijah, even if born in Galilee (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>, for the belief of the Jews), was trained for his work in Gilead. It was, <span class="accented">therefore</span>, a rugged, unsettled, half-civilized, trans-Jordanic region gave to the world the greatest of its prophets. In this respect he was like Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>), and his antitype the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-80.htm">Luke 1:80</a>). "The fact that this <span class="accented">mission</span> was entrusted not to a dweller in royal city or prophetic school, but to a genuine child of the deserts and forests of Gilead, is in exact accordance with the dispensations of Providence in other times" (Stanley)] <span class="cmt_word">said unto Ahab</span> [The abrupt way in which Elijah appears upon the scene without a word of introduction or explanation is certainly remarkable. Ewald observes that "his first entry within the <span class="accented">province</span> of the history seems almost as unique and inexplicable as his final disappearance." "Elijah comes in with a <span class="accented">tempest</span>, and goes out with a whirlwind" (Hall). But there is no sufficient ground for believing (Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>.) that a part of our history which described some of his antecedents has been lost to us, or that our text merely recites the <span class="accented">issue</span> of a long conference which Elijah had held with Ahab, for other prophets of this period, Ahijah, Shemaiah, Jehu, are introduced to us in a similar manner, though it must be allowed that their respective ministries were of very different proportions and importance from Elijah's. This sudden appearance, however, is thoroughly characteristic of the man. He presently disappears just as suddenly (ver. 5. Cf. 19:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>). It was thought by some in that age that he was borne hither and thither by the Spirit of God! <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>), and men of a later time caught this as one of his prominent characteristics (Ecclus. 48:1-12).

Elijah only denounces a plague already threatened in the law as the punishment of idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>). He came forward as the vindicator and restorer of the law] <span class="cmt_word">these years</span> [An indefinite period. Its duration depended on Elijah's word, and that again on the penitence, etc., of the people. It was because of the obduracy of king and people that it lasted so long] <span class="cmt_word">but according to my word.</span> [The idolatrous priests no doubt claimed for Baal the dominion over nature and absolute control over the clouds and rain - a power which, it may be worth observing, the monks of the convent of St. Katherine at Sinai, where Elijah was, are thought to possess by the Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula. Elijah directly challenges them to a trial of strength. It was as if he had said, "The God that answereth by rain, let him be God." On the fitness of this miracle, both as a sign and as a punishment, see "Homil. Quart." 5:100,101. "To Eastern and Southern nations, where life and water go always together, where vegetation gathers round the slightest particle of moisture and dies the moment it is withdrawn...the withholding of rain is the withholding of pleasure, of sustenance, of life itself " (Stanley). "My word" is somewhat emphatic, "<span class="accented">Nisi ego, et non alius vir</span>... <span class="accented">dixero</span> " (Seb. Schmidt). No doubt there is a special reference to the prophets of Baal. Their inability to remove the ban would prove the impotency of their god. Elijah had <span class="accented">asked</span> for the supernatural powers which he here claims (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17, 18</a>).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 God wonderfully suits men to the work he designs them for. The times were fit for an Elijah; an Elijah was fit for them. The Spirit of the Lord knows how to fit men for the occasions. Elijah let Ahab know that God was displeased with the idolaters, and would chastise them by the want of rain, which it was not in the power of the gods they served to bestow. Elijah was commanded to hide himself. If Providence calls us to solitude and retirement, it becomes us to go: when we cannot be useful, we must be patient; and when we cannot work for God, we must sit still quietly for him. The ravens were appointed to bring him meat, and did so. Let those who have but from hand to mouth, learn to live upon Providence, and trust it for the bread of the day, in the day. God could have sent angels to minister to him; but he chose to show that he can serve his own purposes by the meanest creatures, as effectually as by the mightiest. Elijah seems to have continued thus above a year. The natural supply of water, which came by common providence, failed; but the miraculous supply of food, made sure to him by promise, failed not. If the heavens fail, the earth fails of course; such are all our creature-comforts: we lose them when we most need them, like brooks in summer. But there is a river which makes glad the city of God, that never runs dry, a well of water that springs up to eternal life. Lord, give us that living water!</body></html>
