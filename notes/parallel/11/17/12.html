Bahr is extremely positive on this point, affirming that, had she been a heathen, the words would have been positively hypocritical, and more, that Elijah would never have been sent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-26.htm">Luke 4:26</a>) to an idolater. He further suggests that possibly she was an Israelite by birth, who had been married to a Phoenician. But all this is extremely doubtful. In the first place, it is noteworthy that the words are, "Jehovah <span class="accented">thy</span> God," words which show that she recognized Elijah, perhaps by his Jewish face, probably by his prophetic dress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>) as a worshipper of Jehovah. But had she also been the same, it is probable that she would have said "my God," for that form would not only have given greater force to her obtestation, but would have established <span class="cmt_word">a</span> bond of sympathy - such as Jews in a foreign land were only too glad to recognize - between them. And the remark that it is hypocrisy to swear by a god in whom one does not believe is disposed of by the consideration that she may well have believed in the Lord as well as in Baal. See note on 1 Kings 5:7. The Tyrians knew nothing of monotheism], <span class="cmt_word">I have not a cake</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b9;</span>, the synonym of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (ver. 13), the smallest kind of bread. It was baked in the ashes; hence the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. We gather from this pitiful disclosure that the famine had already extended to Phoenicia, as it naturally would do, considering how dependent that country was on Israel for its breadstuffs; see note on 1 Kings 5:9,11. Josephus (Ant. 8:13, 2) cites Menander as attesting to a year's drought in the reign of Ethbaal], but an handful of meal in a [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="cmt_word">barrel</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, probably connected with <span class="accented">cadus, cadeau</span>, etc.; bucket, pail], <span class="cmt_word">and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a few sticks (Gesenius). We may compare the German idiom <span class="accented">ein Paar</span> and our "two or three." But "two" in this sense occurs nowhere else in the Bible - "two or three" is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-32.htm">2 Kings 9:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-8.htm">Amos 4:8</a>. According to Roberts, the word is constantly used for "few" by the natives of India. This widow was evidently reduced to the greatest extremities], <span class="cmt_word">that I may go in and dress it for me and my son</span> [The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> here and in ver. 13, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 15. Bahr contends that Elijah first learnt from these words - the mention of a son and the absence of any mention of her husband - that he was addressing a "widow woman." But we read <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14, 19</a>, of "garments of widowhood" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>), and ver. 10, "a widow woman," etc., almost implies that Elijah from the first <span class="accented">recognized</span> her as such], <span class="cmt_word">that we may eat it, and die.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8-16 Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, and some, it is likely, would have bidden him welcome to their houses; yet he is sent to honour and bless with his presence a city of Sidon, a Gentile city, and so becomes the first prophet of the Gentiles. Jezebel was Elijah's greatest enemy; yet, to show her how powerless was her malice, God will find a hiding-place for him even in her own country. The person appointed to entertain Elijah is not one of the rich or great men of Sidon; but a poor widow woman, in want, and desolate, is made both able and willing to sustain him. It is God's way, and it is his glory, to make use of, and put honour upon, the weak and foolish things of the world. O woman, great was thy faith; one has not found the like, no not in Israel. She took the prophet's word, that she should not lose by it. Those who can venture upon the promise of God, will make no difficulty to expose and empty themselves in his service, by giving him his part first. Surely the increase of this widow's faith, so as to enable her thus readily to deny herself, and to depend upon the Divine promise, was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the increase of her meal and oil in the kingdom of providence. Happy are all who can thus, against hope, believe and obey in hope. One poor meal's meat this poor widow gave the prophet; in recompence of it, she and her son did eat above two years, in a time of famine. To have food from God's special favour, and in such good company as Elijah, made it more than doubly sweet. It is promised to those who trust in God, that they shall not be ashamed in evil time; in days of famine they shall be satisfied.</body></html>
