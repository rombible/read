For it is the adoption of the regular Israelitish description of the prophet as her own. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm" title="Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not from where he was, neither told he me his name:">Judges 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-22.htm" title="But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,">1Kings 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1Kings 13:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</span>--The words express the unreasonableness of natural sorrow. The underlying idea is that of the exclamation, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." The better knowledge of God, gained through the presence of the prophet, had, of course, brought out in her a deeper sense of sin, and now makes her feel that her sorrow is a just punishment. With pathetic confusion of idea, she cries out against his presence, as if it were the actual cause of judgment on the sin, which it has simply brought home to her conscience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">what to me</span> and thee.

The child being dead, the mother spake to the prophet, rather to give vent to her sorrow, than in hope of relief. When God removes our comforts from us, he remembers our sins against us, perhaps the sins of our youth, though long since past. When God remembers our sins against us, he designs to teach us to remember them against ourselves, and to repent of them. Elijah's prayer was doubtless directed by the Holy Spirit. The child revived.
