The Heb. omits "Jeroboam"] <span class="cmt_word">heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand</span> [instinctively. His first thought was, not to wait and see whether the promised sign was given, but to seize and punish the man who had dared thus to denounce and thwart him. And we may imagine how extremely mortifying this interruption must have been to him. It threatened the complete frustration of his policy at the very moment when it seemed certain of suceess] <span class="cmt_word">from the altar</span> [the ledge or platform, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, where he stood. He did not leave it, but shouted his commands to his servants], <span class="cmt_word">saying, Lay hold on him.</span> ["Arrest him," "let him not escape." One word in the Heb.] <span class="cmt_word">And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up</span> [Possibly the result of paralysis or tetanus (Ackermann in Bahr). It was like the "withered hand" of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm">Matthew 12:10</a>, etc.) deprived of feeling and vital force, as the next words show]<span class="cmt_word">, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</span> [It was not only powerless to punish, it was punished. "Now stands the king of Israel, like some antique statue, in a posture of impotent endeavour" (Hall). This was a warning to the king, not so much against his unauthorized and schismatical rites, as against his attempt to avenge himself on the messenger of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14, 15</a>).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder and worshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.</body></html>
