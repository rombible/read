It is an expression which occurs several times. See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a>] <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord thy God</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whose messenger thou art. "Jeroboam, conscience stricken, does not dare to call Jehovah his own God" (Wordsworth). This was probably the case, yet surely it is an inference not warranted by the text. The expression, "The Lord thy God," is of constant occurrence, especially when a "man of God" is addressed; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-10.htm">1 Kings 18:10</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and pray for me</span> [This sudden change in his bearing shows how much Jeroboam was frightened.

And the man of God besought</span> [lit., <span class="accented">stroked the face of</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord, and the king's hand was restored him, and became as it was before.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder and worshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.</body></html>
