The "man of God" is throughout carefully distinguished from the "prophet." Josephus calls the former Jadon, probably the Grecized form of Iddo, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>, which appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> Ia'do in the Keri of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>. Iddo, however, notwithstanding his "visions against Jeroboam the son of Nebat" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>), it cannot have been, for he survived to the reign of Abijah, and indeed wrote a "story" (Heb. <span class="accented">Midrash, i.e.</span>, Commentary) of that reign, whereas this man of God died forthwith. For a similar reason, we cannot believe it to have been Shemaiah, the historian of the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5, 15</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">out of Judah</span> [whither, as a rule, both priests and prophets would seem to have retreated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-14.htm">2 Chronicles 11:14, 16</a>). It is clear, however, that the migration of the latter was not so general as that of the former. In ver. 11 we find a prophet at Bethel; in ch. 14. Ahijah is still at Shiloh, and at a later day we find <span class="accented">schools</span> of the prophets at Bethel, Jericho, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5</a>). Stanley says with truth that "the prophetical activity of the time... is to be found in the kingdom, not of Judah, but of Israel," but omits to add that it was because the northern kingdom more especially needed their ministry. It was just for this reason that Ahijah and others remained at their posts.] <span class="cmt_word">by</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in</span>, same word as in vers. 2, 9, 17, 20, 32, etc. Similarly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> is not merely instrumental, but, like the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, of the N.T., denotes the sphere or element. "<span class="accented">By</span> the word" would imply that he had received a Divine communication; "<span class="accented">in</span> the word," that his message possessed him, inspired him, was "in his heart as a burning fire shut up in his bones" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">the word of the Lord unto Bethel</span> [It is worth remembering that the new sanctuary at Bethel would probably be visible from the temple (Porter, p. 219; Van de Velds, 2:283), so that this function was an act of open defiance]: <span class="cmt_word">and Jeroboam stood by</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">upon</span>. See on 1 Kings 12:32, 33. It is the same occasion] <span class="cmt_word">the altar to burn incense</span> [or to burn the fat, etc., of the sacrifice. See on 1 Kings 12:33. This altar was clearly, <span class="accented">pro hac vice</span>, an altar of burnt offering; not an altar of incense, as is proved by the next verse.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder and worshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.</body></html>
