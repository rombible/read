But, even setting aside the rather prosaic tradition of his attempts to remove any impression made on the mind of Jeroboam, which Josephus has preserved (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span>, 9), it is evident that his policy was only too successful. The messenger of wrath had been enticed to familiar intercourse with the prophet of the new idolatry, and had been publicly proclaimed as his "brother:" probably his death had been used to discredit his warning. The result is seen in the significant notice of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-33.htm" title="After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.">1Kings 13:33</a> : "After this thing, Jeroboam returned not from his evil way." Hence the seriousness of the disobedience, which played into the hands of wickedness, and the startling severity of the penalty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he laid his carcase in his own grave</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>. This was a mark of profound respect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-6.htm">Genesis 23:6</a>)]; <span class="cmt_word">and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother.</span> [A customary formula in lamentation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>). It hardly implies that "he was mourned and buried as a relative of the family" (Bahr). Seeing that the old prophet was responsible for his death, he could hardly have done less. "It is a cruel courtesy to kill a man and then help him to his grave" (Hall).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:23-34 God is displeased at the sins of his own people; and no man shall be protected in disobedience, by his office, his nearness to God, or any services he has done for him. God warns all whom he employs, strictly to observe their orders. We cannot judge of men by their sufferings, nor of sins by present punishments; with some, the flesh is destroyed, that the spirit may be saved; with others, the flesh is pampered, that the soul may ripen for hell. Jeroboam returned not from his evil way. He promised himself that the calves would secure the crown to his family, but they lost it, and sunk his family. Those betray themselves who think to support themselves by any sin whatever. Let us dread prospering in sinful ways; pray to be kept from every delusion and temptation, and to be enabled to walk with self-denying perseverance in the way of God's commands.</body></html>
