the "man of God" would seem to have come on foot. See below] <span class="cmt_word">for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</span> This translation is inadmissible. For not only is the term "prophet" throughout this narrative restricted to the prophet of Bethel (the prophet of Judah being always spoken of as "the man of God,") but the expression here used <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d4;</span> is also twice used (vers. 20, 26) of the same prophet. He is characterized there, that is to say, as "the prophet which brought him back;" it is hardly likely, therefore, that the same words are here to be interpreted, "the prophet whom he brought back." The mistake has arisen from the proximity of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> ("for him") to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> ("to" or "for the prophet"). But the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>is here indicative of possession (the dative of the possessor), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-16.htm">1 Samuel 14:16</a>, "the watchmen to," <span class="accented">i.e., of</span>, "Saul," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, "a son to Jesse" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a> Heb.; 1 Kings 5:29 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:15<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Heb.; Ruth 2:3 Heb.) We must therefore render "He (the old prophet, but this is not absolutely certain; the "man of God" <span class="accented">may</span> be understood) saddled for him (the man of God) the ass of the prophet which brought him back." The man of God had been delayed by his return to Bethel, and the prophet, out of pity, lends or gives him his ass. Not merely, it is probable, for the sake of speeding him on his way, but that he might have some living thing with him on a journey which he had so much cause to dread. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:23-34 God is displeased at the sins of his own people; and no man shall be protected in disobedience, by his office, his nearness to God, or any services he has done for him. God warns all whom he employs, strictly to observe their orders. We cannot judge of men by their sufferings, nor of sins by present punishments; with some, the flesh is destroyed, that the spirit may be saved; with others, the flesh is pampered, that the soul may ripen for hell. Jeroboam returned not from his evil way. He promised himself that the calves would secure the crown to his family, but they lost it, and sunk his family. Those betray themselves who think to support themselves by any sin whatever. Let us dread prospering in sinful ways; pray to be kept from every delusion and temptation, and to be enabled to walk with self-denying perseverance in the way of God's commands.</body></html>
