This expression is an evident mark of the antiquity of the document from which the history is taken. It has been suggested that the narrative implies a needless loitering of the prophet of Judah on the way. Taken by itself, it would not necessarily convey this; but in relation to the temper indicated in the whole story, the thing may be not improbable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> oak; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the well-known oak. Possibly there was but one, or one of great size, in the neighbourhood - such trees are comparatively rare in Palestine. Possibly also this tree became well known from these events. It is singular that in another place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>) we read of "the oak" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of Bethel, whilst in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a> we read of the "palm tree" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) of Deborah, between Ramah and <span class="accented">Bethel</span>." And it is not at all improbable, seeing that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a> we read of the terebinth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of <span class="accented">Tabor -</span> in the A.V. rendered "<span class="accented">plain</span> of Tabor" - which Ewald ("Hist. Israel," 3:21; 4:31) considers to be only a dialectic variation of <span class="accented">Deborah</span>, and remembering the great age to which these trees attain, that the same tree is referred to throughout. The word here used, it is true, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (which is generally supposed to indicate the terebinth, but is also "used of any large tree" (Gesenius), and which, therefore, may be used of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> of Bethel. Both names are derived from the same root (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">fortis</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a>), and both indicate varieties - <span class="accented">what</span> varieties it is not quite clear - of the oak. Some expositors have seen in this brief rest the beginning of <span class="accented">his</span> sin, and certainly it would seem against the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of his instructions to remain so near a place (see note on ver. 16) from which he was to vanish speedily, and, if possible, unperceived.

When the change took place under Jeroboam, he preferred his ease and interest to his religion. He took a very bad method to bring the good prophet back. It was all a lie. Believers are most in danger of being drawn from their duty by plausible pretences of holiness. We may wonder that the wicked prophet went unpunished, while the holy man of God was suddenly and severely punished. What shall we make of this? The judgments of God are beyond our power to fathom; and there is a judgment to come. Nothing can excuse any act of wilful disobedience. This shows what they must expect who hearken to the great deceiver. They that yield to him as a tempter, will be terrified by him as a tormentor. Those whom he now fawns upon, he will afterwards fly upon; and whom he draws into sin, he will try to drive to despair.</body></html>
