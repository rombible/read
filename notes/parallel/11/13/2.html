It has been indeed suggested that the words. "Josiah by name" are a marginal gloss which has crept into the text, or the insertion of the chronicler writing after the event, and not a part of the original prophetic utterance. The latter supposition is in itself not unlikely. But the mention of the name in prediction is exemplified in the well-known reference to Cyrus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; and in this instance, as perhaps also in that, the name is significant (for Josiah means "one healed" or "helped by Jehovah"), and is not, therefore, a mere artificial detail. The particularity of prediction, which is on all hands recognised as exceptional, will be credible or incredible to us, according to the view which we take of the nature of prophetic prediction. If we resolve it into the intuitive sagacity of an inspired mind forecasting the future, because it sees more clearly than ordinary minds the germs of that future in the present, the particularity must seem incredible. If, on the other hand, we believe it to be the supernatural gift of a power to enter, in some measure, into "the mind of God," in whose fore- knowledge all the future is already seen and ordained, then it will be to us simply unusual, but in no sense incredible, that from time to time foreknowledge of details, as well as generalities, should be granted. It is beyond controversy that the latter view is the one put forward in Holy Scripture, both in the Old Testament and in the New. Prophecy is, indeed, something higher and greater than supernatural prediction; but it claims to include such prediction, both as a test of mission from God, and as a necessary part of its revelation of the dispensations of God. On the fulfilment of this prediction, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord</span> [This apostrophe of the altar is very striking and significant. It is as if the prophet disdained to notice the royal but self-constituted priest; as if it were useless to appeal to him; as if his person was of little consequence compared with the religious system he was inaugurating, the system of which the altar was the centre and embodiment]; <span class="cmt_word">Behold a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name</span> [This particular mention of the Reformer by name was formerly regarded, as by many it is still, as a remarkable instance of prophetic foresight. But the tendency of late, even amongst orthodox theologians, has been to doubt the authenticity of these two words, on the ground that it is unlike Scripture prophecy in general to descend to such details, which rather belong to soothsaying than prediction. Prophecy concerns itself not with names, times, and similar particulars, but with the "progressive development of the kingdom of God in its general features" (Keil). It is not for a moment denied that the prophet could just as easily, speaking "in the word of the Lord," have mentioned the name of Josiah, as the circumstance that a son of the house of David would utterly destroy the worship of calves. But it is alleged that the latter prediction is quite in accordance with Scripture usage, and the former altogether contrarient thereto. The case of Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>), it is true, is an exception to the rule, unless <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (which means <span class="accented">the sun</span>) is, like Pharaoh and Hadad, a name of office, a title of the Persian kings. The instances of Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) and Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>) are not parallels, as in both these cases the name was highly significant, and each was mentioned, not by way of prophecy, but as a direction to bestow that name on a child shortly about to be born. And it is certainly noticeable - though the argument <span class="accented">e</span> <span class="accented">silentio is</span> necessarily a precarious one - "that where this narrative is again referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-18</a>) there is no allusion to the fact that the man of God had prophesied of Josiah <span class="accented">by</span> <span class="accented">name"</span> (Rawlinson). On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that the two words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;</span> were no part of the original prophecy, but a marginal note which in course of time found its way accidentally into the text. The idea of Keil, that "Josiah" is mentioned here not as a proper name, but as an appellation, "he whom Jehovah sustains," is hardly worthy of serious consideration. It may be allowed, however, that the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the name affords some slender reason for its mention]; <span class="cmt_word">and upon thee shall he offer</span> [lit., <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the priests of the high places</span> [see on 1 Kings 12:32] <span class="cmt_word">that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bones of man, i.e.</span>, human bones. Nothing could more completely foreshadow the future desecration of the altar. The presence in the congregation of a living man who had merely touched a dead body and had not been purified, defiled the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>), how much more the dead body itself, burnt on the very altar. The Samaritan who once strewed the temple with human ashes (Jos., Ant. 18:02.2) knew that he took the most effectual way to pollute it] <span class="cmt_word">shall be burnt</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">shall they burn</span>] <span class="cmt_word">upon thee.</span> [For the fulfilment, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-20.htm">2 Kings 23:20</a>, "At the ground of this judgment, as of the whole theocratic law, lies the <span class="accented">jus</span> talionis" (Keil, 1846).] It is worthy of note how completely this brief protest proclaimed to Jeroboam the utter and shameful overthrow, both of his political and religious systems. A child of the rival house of David should stand where <span class="accented">he</span> then stood, his successors extinct or powerless to prevent him, and should cover this new cultus with disgrace and contempt. The man of God, he must have felt, has proclaimed in few words the fall of his dynasty, the triumph of his rival, and the failure of all his schemes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder and worshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.</body></html>
