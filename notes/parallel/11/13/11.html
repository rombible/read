Like Balaam, he united true prophetic gifts with a low worldliness of temper, capable on occasion of base subterfuge and deceit. Such union of elements, which should be utterly discordant, is only too characteristic of man's self-contradictory nature. He had thrown in his lot with Jeroboam's policy, which did not want plausible grounds of defence: in spite of this adhesion, he desired to continue still a prophet of the Lord, and to support the king's action by prophetic influence. It has been noticed that, after the maintenance of the idolatry of Beth-el, even the true prophets did not break off their ministry to the kingdom of Israel, and that, indeed, they never appeared in open hostility to that kingdom, till the introduction of Baal worship. But their case is altogether different from that of the old prophet. He deliberately supports the idolatry, and that by the worst of falsehoods--a falsehood in the name of God. They rebuke the sin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-9.htm" title="But have done evil above all that were before you: for you have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:">1Kings 14:9</a>), but do not forsake their ministry to the sinner.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there dwelt an old prophet</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">a certain</span> (lit. one) <span class="accented">old prophet</span>. For this use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> ( = <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>] <span class="cmt_word">at Bethel</span> [It is at first somewhat surprising to find one of the prophetic order residing here, at the very seat and stronghold of the apostasy, especially after what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-16</a>, that the priests and Levites, and it would seem all devout worshippers of the Lord God of Israel, had left the country, and had gone over to Rehoboam. For we cannot suppose that a sense of duty had kept this prophet at his post (see note on ver. 1). The fact that he remained, not only in the kingdom, but at its ecclesiastical capital; that he stood by without protest when the schism was being effected, and that, though not present himself at the sacrifice, he permitted his sons to be there, is a sufficient index to his character. It is quite possible that strong political sympathies had warped his judgment, and that he had persuaded himself that the policy of Jeroboam was necessitated by the division of the kingdom, which he knew to be from the Lord, and which one of his own order had foretold. Or it may be that, despite his better judgment, he had gone with his tribe and the majority of the nation, and now felt it difficult to withdraw from a false position. Or, finally, he may have taken the side of Jeroboam because of the greater honours and rewards that prince had to bestow (see on ver. 18). There is a striking similarity between his position and action and that of Balaam]; <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">his sons</span> [The Heb. has <span class="accented">son</span>; The LXX., Syr., and Vulg., <span class="accented">sons</span>. It is quite true that a "very slight change in the Hebrew text would bring it into accordance with the Septuagint here" (Rawlinson, similarly Ewald), but it would be against sound principles of textual criticism to make it. It is much more likely that the LXX. and other versions <span class="accented">have</span> been altered already, and that the plural has been introduced here because it is uniformly found in the later narrative. "<span class="accented">His</span> <span class="accented">son"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span>), as the <span class="accented">lectio</span> <span class="accented">ardua</span>, is therefore to he retained. The use of the singular indicates that one of them was at first the principal speaker. Perhaps one hastened home with the news before the rest. The sons of the prophet are not to be confounded with "the sons (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, disciples) of the <span class="accented">prophets"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 4</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>); not merely because "the latter would scarcely have witnessed the golden calf worship" (Bahr), but also because they would have been differently designated] <span class="cmt_word">came and told him all the works</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">work</span>] <span class="cmt_word">that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they</span> [observe the plural] <span class="cmt_word">told also to their father.</span> [It is quite clear that the virtual excommunication which the man of God had pronounced had made as great an impression as the signs which he had showed. The interdict was a matter which came home to the Bethelites, as an affront to the whole community.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:11-22 The old prophet's conduct proves that he was not really a godly man. When the change took place under Jeroboam, he preferred his ease and interest to his religion. He took a very bad method to bring the good prophet back. It was all a lie. Believers are most in danger of being drawn from their duty by plausible pretences of holiness. We may wonder that the wicked prophet went unpunished, while the holy man of God was suddenly and severely punished. What shall we make of this? The judgments of God are beyond our power to fathom; and there is a judgment to come. Nothing can excuse any act of wilful disobedience. This shows what they must expect who hearken to the great deceiver. They that yield to him as a tempter, will be terrified by him as a tormentor. Those whom he now fawns upon, he will afterwards fly upon; and whom he draws into sin, he will try to drive to despair.</body></html>
