Such was the request of Naaman to Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm" title="And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.">2Kings 5:15</a>), though even this was emphatically refused. But it still savours of astute policy in Jeroboam: for the acceptance of hospitality and reward would in the eyes of the people imply a condonation of the idolatrous worship, which might well destroy or extenuate the impression made by the prophet's prediction. It indicates also--what experience of such men as "the old prophet" would have produced--a low idea of prophetic character and mission, not unlike that which is shown in Balak's treatment of Balaam. That such conceptions are perfectly compatible with a certain belief in the reality of a supernatural power in the prophet--although they, of course, derogate from its true sacredness--the monstrous request of Simon Magus (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-19.htm" title="Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.">Acts 8:19</a>) shows with the most startling clearness. It was evidently to provide against these things--as fatal to the effectiveness of the prophet's mission--that the prohibition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-9.htm" title="For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that you came.">1Kings 13:9</a> was given; nor could its general purpose have been easily misunderstood, either by the king or by the prophet himself. It is a curious coincidence that in his refusal he uses words strangely like the reluctant refusal of Balak's offer by Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm" title="And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.">Numbers 22:18</a>). The very strength of the language is suspicious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself</span> [with food, ablutions, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3</a>, etc.) We are hardly justified in seeing in these words (with Bahr and Keil) an attempt to "gain the prophet over to his side by friendliness," and to render his threat harmless in the eyes of the people. The king doubtless may have hoped that it would "blunt the edge of the prophet's denunciation of his schismatical altar" (Wordsworth); but this was not the object, or not the sole object, with which the invitation was given. Jeroboam could not possibly have done less, after the signal service the man of God had rendered him, than invite him to his palace. Eastern courtesy alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-24.htm">Genesis 43:24</a>, etc.) would require him to offer hospitality to his benefactor. And he could scarcely hope that any hospitalities would either neutralize the impression which the recent miracles had made, or win over to his side one who had a direct commission from the Most High to oppose him. With more reason, Wordsworth cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30</a>, "Honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people." A feeling of gratitude may have <span class="accented">prompted</span> the invitation, while the king at the same time was very sensible of the advantages which would accrue to himself if it were accepted], <span class="cmt_word">and I will give thee a reward</span>. [The services, especially of seers and prophets, were invariably requited in the East with presents, as are those of Judges, Kadis, Kaimakams, and other officers at the present day (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-53.htm">Genesis 24:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-17.htm">Judges 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-18.htm">Judges 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-15.htm">Judges 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-8.htm">2 Kings 8:8, 9</a>).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder and worshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.</body></html>
