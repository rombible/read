It was believed, no doubt, because it chimed in with some secret reluctance to obey, and, by obedience, to give up all reward and hospitality. Hence the belief was a self-deceit, and, as such, culpable. It is inexplicable that the condemnation which it drew down should have been thought strange by any who understands human nature, and knows the self-deceiving colour which our wish gives to our thought. (See the famous Sermon of Bishop Butler on "Self-deceit.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He said unto him; I am a</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophet also as thou art; and an angel</span> (Bahr observes that "he does not venture to say that Jehovah spake to him, but says an angel did." Is it not more probable that the angel was mentioned, partly for the purpose of giving an air of circumstantiality and reality to his story, and partly to convey the idea of his having a superior authority for his message? A communication through a celestial messenger would seem to have been regarded as a higher form of revelation than a subjective communication to the mind of the prophet. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>, etc. Observe, the prophet speaks presently of "the word of Jehovah"] <span class="cmt_word">spake unto me by</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in</span>; same expression as in ver. 17] <span class="cmt_word">the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">he shall eat</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>bread and drink water. But he lied to him</span>. [These last words are inserted parenthetically; hence there is no "but" in the Heb. The true character and designs and motives of this "old prophet" have long been a <span class="accented">crux interpretum</span> (see Hall, Contempl., 2:151-3.) Some, including Josephus and most Jewish commentators, have supposed him to be altogether a false and lying prophet, such as are found plentifully later on in the history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a>); but against this is the fact that he was undoubtedly the channel of a Divine communication (ver. 21). The real difficulty, no doubt, lies in the fact that one by whom the Spirit of God spake to man should have acted so base a part as he did. But it must be remembered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he did not know what a terrible judgment his lie would bring upon "the man of God;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that truth had not the place in the Jewish scheme which it has in Christian morals; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the gift of prophecy is compatible with much moral imperfection on the part of the prophet - the cases of Balaam and Caiaphas will occur to all - and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that this man was constrained to prophesy almost in spite of himself; he was compelled, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to proclaim his own falseness, and to announce the punishment of the man he had himself deceived. It is also to be considered that this lying prophet, like those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>, accomplished the purpose of God, which was to make the man of God a <span class="accented">sign</span> to the men of that generation. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-6.htm">Ezekiel 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-24.htm">Ezekiel 24:24</a>. In this latter consideration, indeed, lies the key to the history, The <span class="accented">object</span> the old prophet had in view it is not so difficult to divine. He hears that the prophet of Judah has refused the hospitality of King Jeroboam, and has put the city of Bethel and the new cultus under a virtual ban by refusing to eat bread in the place, or to hold any communication with the inhabitants, himself among the rest, although he has taken no part, even by his presence, in the ceremonial of the day. He naturally feels himself condemned and aggrieved by this conduct. A <span class="accented">prophet</span> would feel the interdict much more keenly than the people, and there can be little doubt that this man, who had been trying to serve two masters, was deeply mortified by the excommunication pronounced against him. He resolves, therefore, to rehabilitate himself in his own estimation and that of his neighbours, by bringing back the man of God to eat and to drink, and so in effect to remove the interdict, at any cost. If he succeeds, he win make the whole city, and especially the sovereign, whose policy has been so emphatically condemned, his debtor; while by accomplishing what the <span class="accented">king</span> had failed to effect, he will at once heal his wounded pride and secure a position of influence in the new kingdom. If it was the hope of temporal advancement had detained him at Bethel, he now sees, as he thinks, an easy way to its attainment; if it was an ardent sympathy with the new state of things, he sees before him an opportunity of expressing it in a most practical and serviceable way.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:11-22 The old prophet's conduct proves that he was not really a godly man. When the change took place under Jeroboam, he preferred his ease and interest to his religion. He took a very bad method to bring the good prophet back. It was all a lie. Believers are most in danger of being drawn from their duty by plausible pretences of holiness. We may wonder that the wicked prophet went unpunished, while the holy man of God was suddenly and severely punished. What shall we make of this? The judgments of God are beyond our power to fathom; and there is a judgment to come. Nothing can excuse any act of wilful disobedience. This shows what they must expect who hearken to the great deceiver. They that yield to him as a tempter, will be terrified by him as a tormentor. Those whom he now fawns upon, he will afterwards fly upon; and whom he draws into sin, he will try to drive to despair.</body></html>
