The sign, announced to secure credence to the prediction, is itself a visible type of what that prediction foretold, in the shattering of the altar and the scattering of the ashes of the burnt-offering. The sign actually given includes, besides this, the sudden withering of the king's hand, stretched out in defiance of the prophet--an equally plain symbol of the miserable failure of his strength and policy, when opposed to the Law and the judgment of God. It should be noted that the withdrawal of this last sign of wrath, on the submission of the king and the prayer of the prophet, was apparently designed to give Jeroboam one more opportunity of repentance. The last verses of the chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/13-33.htm" title="After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.">1Kings 13:33-34</a>) seem to imply that, but for the interposition of the old prophet of Bethel, he might still have taken that opportunity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gave a sign</span> [The Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> rather signifies a <span class="accented">portent</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">miraculum, prodigium</span>) than a <span class="accented">sign</span>, the proper word for which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. The word occurs repeatedly in the Pentateuch, where it is rendered <span class="accented">wonder</span>, or <span class="accented">miracle</span>, by our translators (Wordsworth). Signs had, of course, been given before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-9.htm">Exodus 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>; etc.) but hardly in such <span class="accented">immediate</span> attestation of a special message. From this time forward such signs are not infrequent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a>). They mark the decline of faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>). As to the need at this crisis for some miraculous token, see Homiletics. The fitness of this particular sign is obvious] <span class="cmt_word">the same day, saying, This is the sign which</span> [Rather <span class="accented">that</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span>. The A.V. rendering hardly makes sense. Nor does it agree, as Rawlinson seems to think, with the LXX., which reads <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord hath spoken</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by me. "This is the proof that my message is from Him, and is no idle threat." Wordsworth sees in this sign "a proof vouchsafed by God Himself to the man of Judah, as well as to Jeroboam, that he was really sent by God," etc. But surely a man who came "in the word of the Lord," and cried, "Thus saith the Lord," wanted no proof that "he was doing God's bidding" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>)]; <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the altar shall be rent and the ashes</span> [strictly, <span class="accented">fat ashes</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>; properly, "fatness" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.), is the fat of the sacrifice, which was burnt upon the altar, mixed with the ashes that consumed it] <span class="cmt_word">that are upon it shall be poured out.</span> [The sign, a partial destruction of the altar, and the scattering of the sacrifice, was admirably calculated to presage its ultimate and final and ignominious overthrow. The idea favoured by Stanley ("Jewish Ch." 2:280) that this prediction was fulfilled "if not before, at least" in the time of Amos, when the altar was destroyed by an earthquake shock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>; cf. 3:14), does not seem to take account of ver. 5.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder and worshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.</body></html>
