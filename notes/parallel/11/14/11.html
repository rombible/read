The "dogs" are the half-wild' dogs, the scavengers of every Eastern city; the "fowls of the air" the vultures and other birds of prey. In ancient times the natural horror of insult to the remains of the dead was often intensified by the idea, that in some way the denial of the rites of burial would inflict suffering or privation on the departed soul. Whether such ideas may have lingered in the minds of the Israelites we have no means of knowing. But certainly their whole system of law and ritual was calculated to give due honour to the body in life, as consecrated to God; and this would naturally tend to teach them that the body was a part of the true man, and therefore to deepen the repugnance, with which all reverent feeling regards outrage on the dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him that dieth of Jeroboam</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to</span> Jeroboam, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, belonging to, of the house cf.

They exist there in great numbers, and in a semi-savage state, and the carcases of animals and carrion of all sorts are left for them to consume, which they do most effectually, roaming the streets all night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6, 14</a>) in search of garbage. Vultures and other birds of prey perform a similar office in the open country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>)]: <span class="cmt_word">for the Lord hath spoken it.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:7-20 Whether we keep an account of God's mercies to us or not, he does; and he will set them in order before us, if we are ungrateful, to our greater confusion. Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.</body></html>
