His exaltation and the promise to him, his idolatry and its punishment, are all that the historian cares to narrate. All else is summed up in the words "how he warred" (see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm" title="And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.">1Kings 14:30</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-6.htm" title="And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.">1Kings 15:6</a>) and "how he reigned." It is probable that his reign was prosperous enough in peace and war, though his attempt to subdue Judah failed. (See 2 Chronicles 13) But all this the Scriptural record passes over, and only commemorates him as "Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred</span> [see ver. 30; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> [As to this work, see Introduction, Section VI.

Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.</body></html>
