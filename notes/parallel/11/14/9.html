The guilt, indeed, of Jeroboam's act was enhanced by the presumptuous contempt of the special promise of God, given on the sole condition of obedience. In respect of this, perhaps, he is said below--in an expression seldom used elsewhere--to have "cast God Himself behind his back." But probably the reference is mainly to the unprecedented effect of the sin, coming at a critical point in the history of Israel, and from that time onward poisoning the springs of national faith and worship. Other idolatries came and passed away: this continued, and at all times "made Israel to sin."<p><span class= "bld">Other gods and molten images.</span>--See in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm" title="And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.">1Kings 11:28</a> the repetition of the older declaration in the wilderness, "These be thy gods, O Israel." Jeroboam would have justified the use of the calves as simply emblems of the true God; Ahijah rejects the plea, holding these molten images, expressly forbidden in the Law, to be really objects of worship--"other gods,"--as, indeed, all experience shows that such forbidden emblems eventually tend to become. Moreover, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-15.htm" title="For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.">1Kings 14:15</a> it appears that the foul worship of the <span class= "ital">Asherah</span> ("groves") associated itself with the idolatry of Jeroboam.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But hast done evil above all that were before thee</span> [perhaps preceding <span class="accented">kings</span> are not meant, so much as judges - <span class="accented">judices et duces Israelis</span> (Le Clerc). Kings, however, are not excluded. Both Saul and Solomon had sinned (1 Samuel <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5, 6</a>), though neither had set up an organized idolism and "made Israel to sin"]: <span class="cmt_word">for thou hast gone and made thee other gods</span> [in defiance of the decalogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>).

Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.</body></html>
