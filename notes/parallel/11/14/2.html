It is evident that the old blind prophet still remained there, and exercised his prophetic office for the benefit of Israel, though he stood aloof from, and denounced, the new idolatry of Bethel. This idolatry is always described as pre-eminently the "sin of Jeroboam," who by it "made Israel to sin." Hence, while in consequence of it the royal house is condemned, the people are still regarded as God's chosen people, to whom, even more than to the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah, the prophets ministered, and to whom--having no longer the Temple and the consecrated royalty of David, as perpetual witnesses for God--the prophetic ministrations were of pre-eminent importance. Accordingly, the wife of Jeroboam is bidden to approach the prophet disguised as a daughter of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam said to his wife</span> [Conscious that his proceedings would merit Ahijah's reproof, he is afraid to go in person. And his wife - if in this particular we may trust the LXX., an Egyptian princess - could be more readily disguised. The commission was too delicate to be entrusted to a stranger. "None might know it but his own bosom, and she that lay in it" (Bp. Hall). Jeroboam evidently suspected that this sickness was punitive, and he would not have others think so too], <span class="cmt_word">Arise, I pray thee, and disguise</span> [lit., <span class="accented">change</span>. The word suggests that the disguise was to be effected by a change of <span class="accented">garments</span>. "She must put off her robes and put on a russet coat" (<span class="accented">ib</span>.) Possibly the queen was not unknown to the prophet (ver. 4)] <span class="cmt_word">thyself, that thou</span> [Observe the archaic form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>, which latter the Keri would substitute, quite needlessly, here] <span class="cmt_word">be not known</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, those whom she met, not the prophet only) <span class="accented">shall not know that thou art</span>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh</span> [the modern <span class="accented">Seilun</span>. "There is no site in the country fixed with greater certainty than that of Shiloh" (Conder, p. 44. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>). The identification, however, was only effected in 1838. Conder gives some interesting particulars which lead him to believe that we can identify the very site of the tabernacle. For its history, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>. Presuming that Tirzah is to be identified with <span class="accented">Teiasir</span> (see on ver. 17) Shiloh would be over thirty miles' distant - more than a day's journey to the queen, as the road involves some toilsome climbing]: <span class="cmt_word">behold, there is Ahijah the prophet</span> [see on 1 Kings 11:29. Shiloh was probably the birthplace, as well as the residence, of Ahijah. It was in the territory of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>), and at no great distance from Bethel. We can only explain Ahijah's continued residence there, after the migration of the God-fearing Israelites to the southern kingdom, not by his great age, but by the supposition that, having been concerned in the transfer of the kingdom to Jeroboam, he felt it a duty to stay and watch his career. And the time has now come when he can be useful. His relations with Jeroboam had apparently so far been good. He had not protested, so far as we know, against the calf worship, but then God had sent another prophet to do that], <span class="cmt_word">which told me that I should be king</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">he spake of me for king</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>over this people.</span> [So that he had already proved himself a true prophet, and so far a prophet of good.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 At that time, when Jeroboam did evil, his child sickened. When sickness comes into our families, we should inquire whether there may not be some particular sin harboured in our houses, which the affliction is sent to convince us of, and reclaim us from. It had been more pious if he had desired to know wherefore God contended with him; had begged the prophet's prayers, and cast away his idols from him; but most people would rather be told their fortune, than their faults or their duty. He sent to Ahijah, because he had told him he should be king. Those who by sin disqualify themselves for comfort, yet expect that their ministers, because they are good men, should speak peace and comfort to them, greatly wrong themselves and their ministers. He sent his wife in disguise, that the prophet might only answer her question concerning her son. Thus some people would limit their ministers to smooth things, and care not for having the whole counsel of God declared to them, lest it should prophesy no good concerning them, but evil. But she shall know, at the first word, what she has to trust to. Tidings of a portion with hypocrites will be heavy tidings. God will judge men according to what they are, not by what they seem to be.</body></html>
