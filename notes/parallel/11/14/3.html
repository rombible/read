Alex., were for the prophet's <span class="accented">children</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and a cruse</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, leather bottle, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;</span> <span class="accented">Bakbuk</span>, is clearly an onomatopoetic word, suggested by the bubbling noise of liquids in emptying] <span class="cmt_word">of honey</span> [Spices and other delicacies were often given as presents, and honey was a special product of the country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-29.htm">2 Samuel 17:29</a>. The honey sent by Jacob to Joseph was probably "honey of grapes"). The present was purposely a poor one, for the sake of maintaining the deception; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, it was a part of the disguise], <span class="cmt_word">and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">be to</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the child</span>. [At first it strikes us as strange that Jeroboam merely asks what the result will be. He does not petition, that is to say, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-6.htm">1 Kings 13:6</a>, for a cure. But we find the same peculiarity, which some would explain by the fatalism of the East, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>, and ch. 8:9, In the present instance, however, no such explanation is needed. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jeroboam could hardly ask a favour of a prophet of Jehovah, or hope that it would be granted if he did, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if, as he feared, the sickness was judicial, it would be useless to ask for healing. The infatuation which insisted on a disguise for the purpose of deceiving the prophet, who nevertheless was believed to be able to divine the issue of the sickness, is very characteristic, and has had many parallels since. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 At that time, when Jeroboam did evil, his child sickened. When sickness comes into our families, we should inquire whether there may not be some particular sin harboured in our houses, which the affliction is sent to convince us of, and reclaim us from. It had been more pious if he had desired to know wherefore God contended with him; had begged the prophet's prayers, and cast away his idols from him; but most people would rather be told their fortune, than their faults or their duty. He sent to Ahijah, because he had told him he should be king. Those who by sin disqualify themselves for comfort, yet expect that their ministers, because they are good men, should speak peace and comfort to them, greatly wrong themselves and their ministers. He sent his wife in disguise, that the prophet might only answer her question concerning her son. Thus some people would limit their ministers to smooth things, and care not for having the whole counsel of God declared to them, lest it should prophesy no good concerning them, but evil. But she shall know, at the first word, what she has to trust to. Tidings of a portion with hypocrites will be heavy tidings. God will judge men according to what they are, not by what they seem to be.</body></html>
