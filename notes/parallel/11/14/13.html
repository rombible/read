It is much like the prophetic declaration to Josiah at the time of the approaching fall of the kingdom of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/22-18.htm" title="But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which you have heard;">2Kings 22:18-20</a>). But, at the same time, we find in the Old Testament little indication of that general view of the prevalent sorrow and burden of life, which makes Herodotus, in his celebrated story of Cleobis and Bito (Book 1:100:31), imply that at all times early death is Heaven's choicest blessing. Such a view, indeed, is expressed in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/3-11.htm" title="Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?">Job 3:11-22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm" title="So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.">Ecclesiastes 4:1-3</a>; but these are clearly exceptional. Life is viewed--sometimes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/88-10.htm" title="Will you show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise you? Selah.">Psalm 88:10-12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18-19</a>, even in contrast with the unseen world--as a place of God's favour and blessing, which nothing but man's wilful sin can turn to sorrow. The presence and the penalty of sin are recognised from the day of the Fall onwards, yet as only impairing, and not destroying, man's natural heritage of joy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And an Israel shall mourn for him</span> [no doubt he was heir to the throne] <span class="cmt_word">and bury him</span> [mentioned to heighten the contrast.

"The Rabbins have a fable that he disobeyed his father's command to hinder people travelling to Jerusalem to keep the feasts, and that he even removed obstructions in the road" (Bahr)] <span class="cmt_word">toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:7-20 Whether we keep an account of God's mercies to us or not, he does; and he will set them in order before us, if we are ungrateful, to our greater confusion. Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.</body></html>
