The "images" of this passage seem undoubtedly to have been stone pillars, as the "groves" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the asherahs) were wooden stumps of trees (possibly in both cases surmounted by some rude representation of the deity worshipped). The first mention of such a pillar is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-13.htm" title="I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm" title="And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.">Genesis 35:14</a>, there applied to the stone which Jacob raises and anoints, in order to mark the scene of the vision at Bethel; next, we find repeated commands to destroy them (with the asherahs also) as erected by the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm" title="You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but you shall utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.">Exodus 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm" title="But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm" title="You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm" title="And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>), and to suffer neither near the altar of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>). Like the high places, it seems plain that both might be either unauthorised emblems of God's presence or images of false gods; and, indeed, the stone pillar appears in some cases to be associated with the worship of Baal, as the Asherah with that of Ashtoreth. In this passage, from the strength of the language used, and from the notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-24.htm" title="And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.">1Kings 14:24</a>, it seems that the grosser idolatry is referred to. It was practised "on every high hill, and every shady tree"--such trees as were notable for size and shade in the bareness of the hills of Palestine.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they also</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they as well as the ten tribes] <span class="cmt_word">built them high places</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, houses of high places.

These were, no doubt, originally memorial pillars or stones, erected to commemorate some Divine manifestation, and with no thought of idolatry (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>). But the Canaanites erected pillars, which were also statues or images, to their god, Baal. Hence we read of the "image" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26, 27</a>; cf. 18:4; 23. 14); and hence also we find such images frequently mentioned side by side with the so-called "groves," <span class="accented">i.e., the</span> "Asherahs" (ver. 15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>, etc.) Both the <span class="accented">Mazzebah</span> and the <span class="accented">Asherah</span>, consequently, was an upright pillar or post, but the former was of stone, the latter of wood; the former dedicated to Baal, the god of nature, of generation; the latter to Ashtoreth, the goddess of nature and productive power. The gradual transition of the memorial pillar into the Baal statue <span class="cmt_word">is</span> hinted at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>. It is observable that these idolatrous and immoral rites seem to have found a home in Judah before they were introduced into Israel] <span class="cmt_word">and groves</span> [<span class="accented">Asherahs</span>, idols; see on ver. 15. This verse proves conclusively that the translation "grove" is a mistaken one] <span class="cmt_word">on every high hill, and under every green tree.</span> [The phrase is from the Pentateuch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>. "Probably the evil example of Maachah, his favourite wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20-22</a>), whose idolatrous tastes were displayed under Asa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>), was not without a pernicious effect on Rehoboam" (Wordsworth).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:21-31 Here is no good said of Rehoboam, and much said to the disadvantage of his subjects. The abounding of the worst crimes, of the worst of the heathen, in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen for his temple and his worship, shows that nothing can mend the hearts of fallen men but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. On this alone may we depend; for this let us daily pray, in behalf of ourselves and all around us. The splendour of their temple, the pomp of their priesthood, and all the advantages with which their religion was attended, could not prevail to keep them close to it; nothing less than the pouring out the Spirit will keep God's Israel in their allegiance to him. Sin exposes, makes poor, and weakens any people. Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took away the treasures. Sin makes the gold become dim, changes the most fine gold, and turns it into brass.</body></html>
