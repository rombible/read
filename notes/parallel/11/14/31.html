<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-8.htm">1 Kings 15:8, 24</a>, etc. It is used of nearly all the kings of Judah], <span class="cmt_word">and was buried with his fathers</span> [These words go to prove, against Gesenius, that the phrase "slept (lit. <span class="accented">lay down</span>) with his fathers" is not to be interpreted of Sheol, but of the grave; see on 1 Kings 2:10] <span class="cmt_word">in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.</span> [Same words as in ver. 21. The repetition can hardly be, as Bahr, Wordsworth, <span class="accented">al</span>., imagine, designed, in order to show that the worship of Moloch was brought by her to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>), and that she exercised a sinister influence upon her son. As she is twice called "the Ammonitess" it can hardly be doubted that she was one of the "Ammonitesses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, Hebrews) who turned away Solomon's heart; and it is also certain that Rehoboam did not inherit his folly from his father. At the same time these words are more easily accounted for on the supposition that the historian found them in this position in one or more of the documents from which he compiled his history. It is also to be remembered that some of these chronological statements are manifestly by a later hand, and have been transferred from the margin to the text. See on 1 Kings 6:1.] <span class="cmt_word">And Abijam</span> [elsewhere called <span class="accented">Abijah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-16.htm">2 Chronicles 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-1.htm">2 Chronicles 13:1</a>), or <span class="accented">Abijahu</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-21.htm">2 Chronicles 13:21</a>, Hebrews) Some MSS. have Abijah here. The variation is not easily accounted for except as a clerical error. The supposition of Lightfoot that the name was designedly altered by the historian <span class="cmt_word">to</span> avoid the incorporation of the sacred JAH into the name of a bad man is too fanciful, the more so as Abijam was by no means an exceptionally bad king. It is, however, approved by Bahr and Rawlinson. But it is as little probable that Abijam is the original form of the name (Keil). The form <span class="accented">Abijahu</span>, the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span>, and the analogy of <span class="accented">Abiel</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>) all make against this idea. On the whole, it is more likely that Abijam results from an error of transcription, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> and the final <span class="hebrew">&#x20;&#x5dd;</span> being easily confounded] <span class="cmt_word">his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:21-31 Here is no good said of Rehoboam, and much said to the disadvantage of his subjects. The abounding of the worst crimes, of the worst of the heathen, in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen for his temple and his worship, shows that nothing can mend the hearts of fallen men but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. On this alone may we depend; for this let us daily pray, in behalf of ourselves and all around us. The splendour of their temple, the pomp of their priesthood, and all the advantages with which their religion was attended, could not prevail to keep them close to it; nothing less than the pouring out the Spirit will keep God's Israel in their allegiance to him. Sin exposes, makes poor, and weakens any people. Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took away the treasures. Sin makes the gold become dim, changes the most fine gold, and turns it into brass.</body></html>
