The words following have in the original no conjunction <span class= "ital">and</span> between them. They are in antithesis to each other, signifying in some form two opposite divisions of males. The literal sense seems to be "him who is shut up, or bound, and him who is left loose;" and this phrase has been variously interpreted as "the bond and the free," "the married and the unmarried," "the child" who keeps at home, "and the man" who goes abroad. Perhaps the last of these best suits the context; it is like "the old and young" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-21.htm" title="And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.">Joshua 6:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm" title="And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.">Esther 3:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-6.htm" title="Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man on whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary.

The house of Jeroboam is the filth which pollutes the sacred band of Israel; to its last relics it is to be swept away by the besom of destruction. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm" title="And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.">2Kings 9:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-10.htm" title="Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.">Psalm 83:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house</span> [The punishment fell on the house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>), not, however, to the exclusion of the prime offender (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-20.htm">2 Chronicles 13:20</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>).

But it is noteworthy, as Gesenius has remarked, that this is not a habit of Eastern men. Every traveller in Egypt will confirm the remark of Herodotus (ch. 2:35) on this subject, and the same applies to Palestine; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the men sit down for this purpose, covered with their garments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-24.htm">Judges 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3</a>). Some, consequently, have been led to suppose that the reference is to the dog, but animals would hardly share in the destruction of the royal house. Gesenius is probably right when he interprets it of <span class="accented">boys</span>. Thus understood, it lends additional meaning to the passages where it occurs. It expresses extermination, root and branch, man and boy], <span class="cmt_word">and him that is shut up and left in Israel</span> [A proverbial expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8</a>), and involving some play upon words. It evidently means "men of all kinds," but as to the precise signification of the terms "shut up" and "left," there has been much difference of opinion, some <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> interpreting them to mean respectively <span class="accented">married</span> and <span class="accented">single</span> also Keil, <span class="accented">al</span>.); others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">bond and free</span> Gesen<span class="accented">, al</span>.); others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">precious</span> and <span class="accented">vile</span>; and others again <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">minors</span> and <span class="accented">those of age</span>.

"<span class="accented">exterminate after"</span> (Gesen.) or "<span class="accented">sweep after"</span> (Keil). The first rendering is the more literal.

Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.</body></html>
