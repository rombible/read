It is like the 144,000 and the 12,000 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-8</a>. The prominent idea is perhaps this: Though the children of Israel have forsaken My covenant, yet I have kept and will keep it. It also suggests how the still small voice had been speaking in the silence] <span class="cmt_word">in Israel, all</span> <span class="cmt_word">the knees which have not bowed unto Baal</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</span> [We gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a> that it was customary to kiss the hand to the idol, or object of worship, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a> to kiss the image itself. Most of the commentators adduce Cicero <span class="accented">in Verrem</span> 4:43, where he speaks of the statue of Hercules at Agrigentum, the lips and chin of which were a little worn by the kisses of devotees.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:14-18 God repeated the question, What doest thou here? Then he complained of his discouragement; and whither should God's prophets go with their complaints of that kind, but to their Master? The Lord gave him an answer. He declares that the wicked house of Ahab shall be rooted out, that the people of Israel shall be punished for their sins; and he shows that Elijah was not left alone as he had supposed, and also that a helper should at once be raised up for him. Thus all his complaints are answered and provided for. God's faithful ones are often his hidden ones, Ps 83:3, and the visible church is scarcely to be seen: the wheat is lost in chaff, and the gold in dross, till the sifting, refining, separating day comes. The Lord knows them that are his, though we do not; he sees in secret. When we come to heaven we shall miss many whom we thought to have met there; we shall meet many whom we little thought to have met there. God's love often proves larger than man's charity, and far more extended.</body></html>
