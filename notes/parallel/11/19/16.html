This apparently imperfect correspondence of the event to the charge, is a strong indication of the historical character of the narrative.<p>The history, indeed, records no actual anointing of Elisha; and it is remarkable that in no other place is any such anointing of a prophet referred to, unless <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-15.htm" title="Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.">Psalm 105:15</a> be an exception. The anointing, signifying the gift of grace, was first instituted for the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-15.htm" title="And you shall anoint them, as you did anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.">Exodus 40:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-3.htm" title="These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.">Numbers 3:3</a>); next it was extended to the royal office, and became, in common parlance, especially attached to it. The prophetic office, as the third great representative of the power of Jehovah, might well be hallowed by the same ordinance, especially as the prophets dispensed it to the kings; but, whether the prophets were always consecrated with the sacred oil, or whether, as in the Prophet of prophets, the "anointing with the Holy Ghost and with power" sometimes superseded the outward sign, we do not know. Abelmeholah ("the meadow of the dance," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm" title="Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:">1Kings 4:12</a>) lay in the rich country near the Jordan valley and the plain of Esdraelon; it was therefore on Elijah's way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu</span> [<span class="accented">Jehovah is he</span>.

Nimshi may have been a person of more importance than Jehoshaphat] <span class="cmt_word">of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel</span> [The prophet thus learns that the house of Omri is to share the fate of the dynasties which had preceded it.

It is to be observed that no such addition follows the mention of Hazael or Jehu] <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room</span> [So far from Elijah's work being fruitless, or from the prophetic order being extinguished, provision is now made for his successor.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:14-18 God repeated the question, What doest thou here? Then he complained of his discouragement; and whither should God's prophets go with their complaints of that kind, but to their Master? The Lord gave him an answer. He declares that the wicked house of Ahab shall be rooted out, that the people of Israel shall be punished for their sins; and he shows that Elijah was not left alone as he had supposed, and also that a helper should at once be raised up for him. Thus all his complaints are answered and provided for. God's faithful ones are often his hidden ones, Ps 83:3, and the visible church is scarcely to be seen: the wheat is lost in chaff, and the gold in dross, till the sifting, refining, separating day comes. The Lord knows them that are his, though we do not; he sees in secret. When we come to heaven we shall miss many whom we thought to have met there; we shall meet many whom we little thought to have met there. God's love often proves larger than man's charity, and far more extended.</body></html>
