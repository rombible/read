"Fire" may well signify lightning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>). For a vivid description of a thunderstorm at Sinai, see Stewart's "Tent and <span class="accented">Khan</span>," pp. 139, 140; ap. Stanley, "Jew. Ch.," vol. 1. p. 149]: <span class="cmt_word">but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice</span>. [Heb. <span class="accented">a voice of gentle silence</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> an onomatopoetic word, is allied to our word <span class="accented">dumb</span>. Very similar expression <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>. What was the object and meaning of this succession of signs? First, let us remember that Elijah was the prophet of deeds. He taught his contemporaries not by word but by act. He is here taught in turn by signs. There passes before him in the mountain hollow, in the black and dark night, a procession of natural terrors-of storm, and earthquake, and fire. But none of these things move him; none speak to his soul and tell of a present God. It is the hushed voice, the awful stillness, overpowers and enchains him. He is to learn hence, first, that the Lord is a God "merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>); and secondly, that as it has been with himself, so it will be with others; the name of the Lord will be proclaimed in a voice of gentle silence (<span class="accented">ib</span>.<span class="accented">, ver</span>. 5). The weapons of His warfare, the instruments of religious progress, must be spiritual, not carnal. Not in fire and sword and slaughter, but by a secret voice speaking to the conscience, will God regain His sway over the hearts of Israel. (See Homiletics.) The striking similarity between this theophany and that which Moses saw in the same place, or at no great distance from it, must not be overlooked, for this constitutes another link between law giver and law restorer. The proclamation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3, 7</a> is the best exponent of the parable of vers. 11, 12. To each was the vision of God granted after a faithful witness against idolatry, and after a slaughter of idolaters; each was in a clift of the rock; in either case the Lord <span class="accented">passed by</span>; the one was taught by words, the other rather by signs, but the message in each case was the same - that judgment is God's strange work, but that He will by no means clear the guilty (cf. ver. 17).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:9-13 The question God put, What doest thou here, Elijah? is a reproof. It concerns us often to ask whether we are in our place, and in the way of our duty. Am I where I should be? whither God calls me, where my business lies, and where I may be useful? He complained of the people, and their obstinacy in sin; I only am left. Despair of success hinders many a good enterprise. Did Elijah come hither to meet with God? he shall find that God will meet him. The wind, and earthquake, and fire, did not make him cover his face, but the still voice did. Gracious souls are more affected by the tender mercies of the Lord, than by his terrors. The mild voice of Him who speaks from the cross, or the mercy-seat, is accompanied with peculiar power in taking possession of the heart.</body></html>
