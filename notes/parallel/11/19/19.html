The act is said to have been a part of the form of adoption of a child; hence its spiritual significance here, which, after a moment's bewilderment, Elisha seems to read.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he departed thence, and found</span> [Nothing can be concluded from this word as to previous acquaintance] <span class="cmt_word">Elisha</span> <span class="cmt_word">the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing</span> [It was in the winter, consequently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a>. See Condor, p. 328). "Elisha is found not in his study, but in the field: not with a book in his hand, but the plough" (Hall). with twelve yoke of oxen [Heb. <span class="accented">ploughing</span> <span class="accented">twelve yoke</span>, from which Ewald gathers that he was ploughing twelve yoke of land - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> like jugum, is used as a measure of land in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-14.htm">1 Samuel 14:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-10.htm">Isaiah 5:10</a> - and was then at work on the twelfth and last.

To understand the reason of this, several things must be taken into account. First, that the arable land of nearly all villages is cultivated in common; then that Arab farmers delight to work together, partly for mutual protection, and partly from their love of gossip," etc. Thomson, L. and B. 1:208]: <span class="cmt_word">and Elijah passed by him</span> [Heb. to <span class="accented">him</span>.

Already, it would seem, the rough hairy mantle had come to be recognized as the garb of a prophet (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>). "The prophet's cloak was a sign of the prophet's vocation" (Keil). To cast the cloak to or upon Elisha was therefore an appropriate and significant way of designating him to the prophetic office. "When Elijah went to heaven Elisha had the mantle entire" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13</a> (Henry). The Germans use the word <span class="accented">mantel-kind</span> of an adopted child.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:19-21 Elijah found Elisha by Divine direction, not in the schools of the prophets, but in the field; not reading, or praying, or sacrificing, but ploughing. Idleness is no man's honour, nor is husbandry any man's disgrace. An honest calling in the world, does not put us out of the way of our heavenly calling, any more than it did Elisha. His heart was touched by the Holy Spirit, and he was ready to leave all to attend Elijah. It is in a day of power that Christ's subjects are made willing; nor would any come to Christ unless they were thus drawn. It was a discouraging time for prophets to set out in. A man that had consulted with flesh and blood, would not be fond of Elijah's mantle; yet Elisha cheerfully leaves all to accompany him. When the Saviour said to one and to another, Follow me, the dearest friends and most profitable occupations were cheerfully left, and the most arduous duties done from love to his name. May we, in like manner, feel the energy of his grace working in us mightily, and by unreserved submission at once, may we make our calling and election sure.</body></html>
