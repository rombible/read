It is probable that from the first, "Horeb, the mount of God," was in his thoughts. He may well have seen that he was destined to be a second Moses; that he was raised up to assert and enforce the covenant of which Moses was the mediator. We have seen already that he cites the words spoken to Moses at the bush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>); that to him as to Moses there was granted an apparition of fire; we now find him rejected as Moses had been before him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-25.htm">Acts 7:25, 35</a>). How natural that, like Moses, he should flee into the land of Midian, to the place where God had spoken With Moses face to face.

It does not, however, afford a complete protection (Thomson, L. and B. vol. 2. pp. 436, 437). Every traveller remarks on its abundance in the desert; it gave a name, <span class="accented">Rithmah</span>, to one of the stations of the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-18.htm">Numbers 33:18</a>.

Time was when he had thought himself a most special messenger of Heaven, raised up to effect the regeneration of his country. He now thinks his work is fruitless, and he has nothing to live for longer. Keil concludes from these words that Elijah was already of a great age, but this is extremely doubtful.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-8 Jezebel sent Elijah a threatening message. Carnal hearts are hardened and enraged against God, by that which should convince and conquer them. Great faith is not always alike strong. He might be serviceable to Israel at this time, and had all reason to depend upon God's protection, while doing God's work; yet he flees. His was not the deliberate desire of grace, as Paul's, to depart and be with Christ. God thus left Elijah to himself, to show that when he was bold and strong, it was in the Lord, and the power of his might; but of himself he was no better than his fathers. God knows what he designs us for, though we do not, what services, what trials, and he will take care that we are furnished with grace sufficient.</body></html>
