For neither Hazael, nor Jehu, nor Elisha, so far as we have any record, was ever <span class="accented">anointed</span> by Elijah. Elisha was <span class="accented">called</span> by him to the prophetic office. Hazael, it is barely possible, may have been anointed secretly, like David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2, 13</a>), but all that we gather from Scripture is, that he was called in an indirect way, and certainly not anointed, by Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-15</a>). Jehu was certainly anointed, but it was neither by Elisha nor Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1, 6</a>), but by one of the sons of the prophets. All we can say, consequently, is that the command was obeyed <span class="accented">in the spirit</span>, and no doubt in the best possible time and way. There may have been good reasons, of which we know nothing, why Elijah should devolve the appointment of the two kings upon his successor, and we can readily understand that the word "<span class="accented">anoint"</span> was, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, never meant to be construed literally. For in the first place, we have no record elsewhere of the anointing of any <span class="accented">prophet</span>; and secondly, it is remarkable that when Elijah might so easily have anointed Elisha, he did nothing of the kind. It is clear, therefore, that he understood the word to mean "appoint." And the root idea of anointing, it must be remembered, was the <span class="accented">setting apart</span> for the service of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>). Hence it was (Bahr) that vessels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a> sqq.), and even stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>), were anointed. And when we find that these three persons were set apart sooner or later, and in different ways, to fulfil the high purposes of God, that ought to suffice us. The author of this history clearly found no difficulty in reconciling this account and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>. It has also been objected to this charge (Rawlinson) that it is no "<span class="accented">explanation</span> or application of the preceding parable." But this is precisely what it appears to have been intended to be. The prophet is here taught by word much the same lesson that had been conveyed by signs, in the preceding vision. No doubt there are additional particulars - the vision dealt only with principles, the charge descends to details and prescribes duties - but still the great lesson that souls are to be won, that God's kingdom is to be advanced, not by wrath and vengeance, by fire and sword, but by meekness and gentleness, through the reason and the conscience, is proclaimed. Hazael and Jehu, each was God's instrument to punish; each was like the sweeping siena or the devouring fire, each was an engine of destruction; but by neither of these were the hearts Of men turned to the Lord. It was the sword of Elisha, the sword of his mouth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-16.htm">Revelation 2:16</a>), should constrain men to hide their faces and humble themselves before God] <span class="cmt_word">Hazael</span> [the <span class="accented">seer of God</span>. This name, viewed in connection with Elijah's vision of God, is noticeable] <span class="cmt_word">to be king over Syria:</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:14-18 God repeated the question, What doest thou here? Then he complained of his discouragement; and whither should God's prophets go with their complaints of that kind, but to their Master? The Lord gave him an answer. He declares that the wicked house of Ahab shall be rooted out, that the people of Israel shall be punished for their sins; and he shows that Elijah was not left alone as he had supposed, and also that a helper should at once be raised up for him. Thus all his complaints are answered and provided for. God's faithful ones are often his hidden ones, Ps 83:3, and the visible church is scarcely to be seen: the wheat is lost in chaff, and the gold in dross, till the sifting, refining, separating day comes. The Lord knows them that are his, though we do not; he sees in secret. When we come to heaven we shall miss many whom we thought to have met there; we shall meet many whom we little thought to have met there. God's love often proves larger than man's charity, and far more extended.</body></html>
