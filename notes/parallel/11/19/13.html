This mantle (see note on 1 Kings 18:46) was probably a sheepskin. The LXX. calls it <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a> we find that the prophets wore a mantle of hair], <span class="cmt_word">and went out, and stood</span> [Same words as in ver. 11. It was the still small voice, apparently, that first brought him to obey the command there given. He would perhaps be afraid to issue from the shelter of his cave during the tempest and the earthquake, which may have followed directly after the instruction to go forth was given. Possibly there was a lesson for him here also, viz., that amid the din and excitement and torture of drought and famine and fire and blood the commands of God are less likely to be heard in the soul and obeyed, than in the hour of peace and stillness. The drought and famine and sword have their work to do, even as the tempest and the earthquake have theirs; but it is by the voice of mercy and love that the hearts of men are turned back again. "Not in the strong east wind that parted the Red Sea, or the fire that swept the top of Sinai, or the earthquake that shook down the walls of Jericho would God be brought so near to man as in the still small voice of the child of Bethlehem" (Stanley)] <span class="cmt_word">in the entering in of the cave.</span> [He hardly obeyed the letter of the command of ver. 11 even then. Does not this point to a rebellious and unsubdued heart? Is it not a confirmation of the view taken above, that he fled to Horeb, full of bitter disappointment and murmuring against God; and that the purpose of this revelation was not only to teach him as to God's dealings with men, but also to school and subdue his own rebellious heart?] <span class="cmt_word">And</span>, <span class="cmt_word">behold, there came a voice unto him</span> [The expression is different from that of ver. 9. There we read of the "word of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> Lord," here of a "voice." But this is not to be identified with the "still small voice" of ver. 12], <span class="cmt_word">and said, What doest, thou here, Elijah?</span> [As in ver. 9.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:9-13 The question God put, What doest thou here, Elijah? is a reproof. It concerns us often to ask whether we are in our place, and in the way of our duty. Am I where I should be? whither God calls me, where my business lies, and where I may be useful? He complained of the people, and their obstinacy in sin; I only am left. Despair of success hinders many a good enterprise. Did Elijah come hither to meet with God? he shall find that God will meet him. The wind, and earthquake, and fire, did not make him cover his face, but the still voice did. Gracious souls are more affected by the tender mercies of the Lord, than by his terrors. The mild voice of Him who speaks from the cross, or the mercy-seat, is accompanied with peculiar power in taking possession of the heart.</body></html>
