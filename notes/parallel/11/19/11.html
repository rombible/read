But our version is probably correct.<p>The whole of the vision, which is left to speak for itself, without any explanation or even allusion in the subsequent message to Elijah, is best understood by comparison with two former manifestations at Horeb, to the people and to Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-5.htm" title="And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.">Exodus 34:5-8</a>). To the people the Lord had then, been manifested in the signs of visible power, the whirlwind, the earthquake, and the fire--first, because these were the natural clothing of the terrors of the Law, which is the will of God visibly enforced; next, because for such visible manifestations of God, and perhaps for these alone, the hearts of Israel were then prepared. To Moses, in answer to his craving for the impossible vision of the glory of the Lord face to face, the manifestation granted was not of the Divine majesty, but of the "Name of the Lord," "the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth;" for this higher conception of the majesty of God, as shown in righteousness and mercy, Moses, as being the greatest of prophets, could well understand. The vision of Elijah stands out in contrast with the one and in harmony with the other. It disclaims the visible manifestation in power and vengeance, for which he had by implication craved; it implies in "the still small voice"--"the voice (as the LXX. has it) of a light breath"--a manifestation like that expressed plainly to Moses, of the higher power of the Spirit, penetrating to the inmost soul, which the terrors of external power cannot reach. The lesson is simply, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit saith the Lord of hosts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a>). The prophet so far reads it that he acknowledges, by veiled face of reverence, the presence of the Lord in "the still small voice," yet, with singular truth to nature, he is recorded as repeating, perhaps mechanically, his old complaint.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Go forth</span> [The LXX. inserts <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which, however, is destitute of authority, and was probably inserted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>, to explain the difficulty which the prophet's apparent disregard of this command creates], <span class="cmt_word">and stand upon the mount before the Lord.

The beatific vision must be transient. An abiding presence, a <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, was more than man could bear. So Bahr. As Elijah does not seem to have gone forth from the cave until he heard the still small voice (ver. 13), some would take the participle <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> which is probably employed as more graphic, as a <span class="accented">future, i.e.</span>, "the Lord will pass by," and this is the interpretation of the LXX.; <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>. The effect of this rearrangement of the text would be that the words, "And behold the Lord passing by," must be taken as a part of the message, "Go forth," etc., and not as a statement of what happened. That statement would then begin with the next words, "And a great and strong wind," etc. But in that case we might have expected "<span class="accented">For</span> behold," etc., or the "And behold" would have come before "a great and strong wind," etc. It is also to be considered - and this seems to me decisive - that the words "rent," "break," etc., are also participles, which it would be unnatural to divorce from the participle preceding], <span class="cmt_word">and a great and strong wind</span> [Such as was net uncommon in that region. The approach to Sinai from the west is known as <span class="accented">Nukb-Hawy</span>, "the pass of the <span class="accented">winds</span>." Elsewhere we find <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="accented">Wady-el-Burk</span>, or "valley of lightning."

"Everywhere there are signs of the action of water, nowhere of fire" (Stanley).

It concerns us often to ask whether we are in our place, and in the way of our duty. Am I where I should be? whither God calls me, where my business lies, and where I may be useful? He complained of the people, and their obstinacy in sin; I only am left. Despair of success hinders many a good enterprise. Did Elijah come hither to meet with God? he shall find that God will meet him. The wind, and earthquake, and fire, did not make him cover his face, but the still voice did. Gracious souls are more affected by the tender mercies of the Lord, than by his terrors. The mild voice of Him who speaks from the cross, or the mercy-seat, is accompanied with peculiar power in taking possession of the heart.</body></html>
