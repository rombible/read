It may, therefore, be thought to imply an interval of retirement for rest and solitary meditation, like the sojourn of Moses in Horeb, and the sojourn of our Lord in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-2.htm" title="And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.">Matthew 4:2</a>) during which the spirit of the prophet might be calmed from the alternations of triumph and despondency, to receive the spiritual lesson which awaited him. During all that time he went "in the strength" of the Divine food, that he might know that "man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm" title="And he humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man live.">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights</span> [Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>. But the primary reference is perhaps to the "forty days and forty nights" which Moses spent in Horeb, during which he "neither did eat bread nor drink water" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), or to the forty years during which Israel was sustained in this same desert with "angels' food" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>). It is noteworthy how both Moses and Elias were precursors of our Lord in a forty days' fast. "The three great fasters met gloriously on Tabor" (Hall). It is not implied that it took the prophet the whole of this time to reach Horeb, which is only distant from Beer-sheba some 130 miles. "There are eleven days' journey <span class="accented">from</span> Horeb, by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>). It is of course possible that he wandered aimlessly hither and thither during this period, but it seems better to understand the words of the whole of his desert sojourn] <span class="cmt_word">unto Horeb the mount of God.</span> [See note on 1 Kings 8:9. It is just possible that Horeb was already known as "the mount of God" at the time God appeared to Moses there - the whole of the Sinaitic peninsula was sacred in the eyes of the Egyptians; but it is more probable that this designation is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a> prophetically, and that it was Bestowed on the Mount of the Law because of the special revelation of the Godhead there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-3.htm">Exodus 19:3, 11, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>, etc.)] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-8 Jezebel sent Elijah a threatening message. Carnal hearts are hardened and enraged against God, by that which should convince and conquer them. Great faith is not always alike strong. He might be serviceable to Israel at this time, and had all reason to depend upon God's protection, while doing God's work; yet he flees. His was not the deliberate desire of grace, as Paul's, to depart and be with Christ. God thus left Elijah to himself, to show that when he was bold and strong, it was in the Lord, and the power of his might; but of himself he was no better than his fathers. God knows what he designs us for, though we do not, what services, what trials, and he will take care that we are furnished with grace sufficient.</body></html>
