In this substructure vast stones are still to be seen, and are referred by many authorities to the age of Solomon. The labour of transport must have been enormous, especially as all were worked beforehand. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-7.htm" title="And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.">1Kings 6:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king commanded and they brought</span> [or <span class="accented">cut out, quarried</span> (Gesen.), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:9</a>; see also ch. 6:7 (Heb.) ] <span class="cmt_word">great stones, costly</span> [precious, not <span class="accented">heavy</span>, as Thenius.

We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-10.htm">1 Kings 7:10</a> that the stones of the foundation of the <span class="accented">palace</span> were squared to 8 cubits and 10 cubits] <span class="cmt_word">to lay the foundation of the house.</span> [Some of these great squared stones, we can hardly doubt, are found <span class="accented">in situ</span> at the present day. The stones at the south-east angle of the walls of the Haram (Mosque of Omar) are "unquestionably of Jewish masonry" (Porter, Handbook, p. 115). "One is 23 2:9 in. long; whilst others vary from 17 to 20 feet in length. Five courses of them are nearly entire" (<span class="accented">ib.</span>) As Herod, in rebuilding the edifice, would seem to have had nothing to do with the foundations, we may safely connect these huge blocks with the time of Solomon. It is also probable that some at least of the square pillars, ranged in fifteen rows, and measuring five feet each side, which form the foundations of the Mosque <span class="accented">El Aksa</span>, and the supports of the area of the Haram, are of the same date and origin (cf. Ewald, Hist. Israel, 3:233). Porter holds that they are "coeval with the oldest part of the external walls." Many of them, the writer observed, were monoliths. The extensive vaults which they enclose are unquestionably "the subterranean vaults of the temple area" mentioned by Josephus (B.J. 5:3. 1), and the <span class="accented">"cavati sub terra montes"</span> of Tacitus. It may be added here that the recent explorations in Jerusalem have brought to light many evidences of Phoenician handiwork.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:10-18 The temple was chiefly built by the riches and labour of Gentiles, which typified their being called into the church. Solomon commanded, and they brought costly stones for the foundation. Christ, who is laid for a Foundation, is a chosen and precious Stone. We should lay our foundation firm, and bestow most pains on that part of our religion which lies out of the sight of men. And happy those who, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, for a habitation of God through the Spirit. Who among us will build in the house of the Lord?</body></html>
