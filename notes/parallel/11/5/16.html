In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a> we read of a body of 3,600 "overseers to set the people a work," whilst in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10</a> mention is made of 250 "princes of the overseers."

We should lay our foundation firm, and bestow most pains on that part of our religion which lies out of the sight of men.
