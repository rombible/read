For Gebal ( = mountain) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a> ("the land of the Giblites and Lebanon"); <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a> ("Gebal and they of Tyro"); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>, where the LXX. translate the word <span class="accented">Biblus</span>, which was the Greek name of the city and district north of the famous river <span class="accented">Adonis</span>, on the extreme border of Phoenicia. It is now known as <span class="accented">Jebeil.</span> It has been already remarked that Tyre and Sidon, as well as Gebal, have Hebrew meanings. These are among the proofs of the practical identity of the Hebrew and Phoenician tongues. The Aramaean immigrants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a>) no doubt adopted the language of Canaan (Dict. Bib., art. "Phoenicians"). Keil renders, <span class="accented">"even</span> the Giblites." He would understand, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the Zidonian workmen were Giblites; but this is doubtful. The Giblites are selected, no doubt, for special mention because of the prominent part they took in the work. Gebal, as its ancient and extensive ruins prove, was a place of much importance, and lying as it did on the coast, and near the cedar forests, would naturally have an important share in the cutting and shipping of the timber. Indeed, it is not improbable that it was at this port that the land transport ended, and the rafts were made. A road ran anciently from Gebal to Baalbak, so that the transport was not impracticable. But as the forests were probably of great extent, there may have been two or three depots at which the timber was floated] so they prepared timber [Heb. <span class="accented">the timber</span>] and stones [Heb. <span class="accented">the stones</span>] to build the house. [The LXX. (Vat. and Alex. alike) add here, "<span class="accented">three</span> <span class="accented">years."</span> It is barely possible that these words may have dropped out of the text, but they look more like a gloss, the inference from the chronological statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:10-18 The temple was chiefly built by the riches and labour of Gentiles, which typified their being called into the church. Solomon commanded, and they brought costly stones for the foundation. Christ, who is laid for a Foundation, is a chosen and precious Stone. We should lay our foundation firm, and bestow most pains on that part of our religion which lies out of the sight of men. And happy those who, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, for a habitation of God through the Spirit. Who among us will build in the house of the Lord?</body></html>
