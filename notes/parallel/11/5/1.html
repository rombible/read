He is described as a "lover of David." Ancient tradition makes him a tributary or dependent monarch; and his attitude, as described in Scripture, towards both David and Solomon agrees with this. Josephus (<span class= "ital">100</span> <span class= "ital">Apion, i.</span> 17, ? 18) cites from Dios, a Ph?nician historian, and Menander of Ephesus, a description of Hiram's parentage, of his prosperous reign and skill in building; and quotes, as from the Tyrian archives (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 11, ?? 6, 7), letters passing between him and Solomon. The embassy here noticed from Hiram is clearly one of congratulation, perhaps of renewal of fealty.

This prince and his friendly relations with the Jews are referred to by the Tyrian historians, of whose materials the Greek writers Dins and Menander of Ephesus (<span class="accented">temp.</span> Alexander the Great) availed themselves. According to Dins (quoted by Josephus contr. Apion, 1:17) Hiram was the son of Abibaal. Menander states that the building of the temple was commenced in the twelfth year of Hiram's reign, which lasted 34 years (Jos. Ant. 8:03.1; Contr. Ap. 1:18). Hiram is further said to have married his daughter to Solomon and to have engaged with him in an intellectual encounter which took the shape of riddles] king of Tyre [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">rock</span>, so called because of the rocky island on which old Tyro was built, sometimes called <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span>, the fortress of, or fortified Tyro (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a>, etc.) The capital of Phoenicia.

An alliance, or good understanding, with Israel was then, as at a later period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>) of great importance to them of Tyre and Sidon.

There is no adversary, no Satan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or to divert from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. When there is no evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that which is good, and get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours. And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17. Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of another, and is benefitted by another, that there may be dependence on one another, to the glory of God.</body></html>
