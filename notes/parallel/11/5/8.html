It is instructive to remember in connexion with this fact that, according to the universal belief of antiquity, the use of letters, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the art of writing, was communicated to the Greeks by the Phoenicians. Gesenius, indeed, holds that the <span class="accented">invention</span> of letters is also due to them. See the interesting remarks of Mr. Twisleton, Dict. Bib. 2. pp. 866-868], <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>, <span class="cmt_word">I have considered the things which thou sentest unto me for</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">heard the things</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, message) <span class="accented">which thou sentest unto</span> me]: <span class="cmt_word">and I will do all thy desire concerning</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in, i.e.</span>, as to] timber [or <span class="accented">trees</span>] of cedar [Heb. <span class="accented">cedars</span>] <span class="accented">and timber of fir</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">trees of cypresses.</span> This is, perhaps, the proper place to inquire what. trees are intended by the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, here respectively translated" cedar" and "fir." As to the first, it is impossible to restrict the word to the one species (<span class="accented">Pinus cedrus or Cedrus Libani</span>) which is now known as the cedar of Lebanon, or, indeed, to <span class="accented">any</span> single plant. That the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span>, one of the most magnificent of trees, is meant in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31.htm">Ezekiel 31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>, etc., admits of no manner of doubt. It is equally clear, however, that in other passages the term "cedar" must refer to some other tree. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-6.htm">Leviticus 14:6</a>, <span class="accented">e.g., the juniper</span> would seem to be meant. "The cedar could not have been procured in the desert without great difficulty, but the juniper (<span class="accented">Juniperus oxycedrus</span>) is most plentiful there." (The "cedar" of our pencils, it may be remarked, is a kind of juniper - <span class="accented">Juniperus Bermudiana.</span>) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>, "they have taken cedars of Lebanon to make <span class="accented">masts</span> for thee," it is probable that the <span class="accented">Pinus</span> <span class="accented">Halepensis</span>, not, as was formerly thought, the Scotch fir (<span class="accented">Pinus sylvestris</span>), is intended. The <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span> appears to be indifferently adapted to any such purpose, for which, however, the <span class="accented">Pinus Halepensis <span class="cmt_word"></span>is</span> eminently fitted. But in the text, as throughout ch. 5-8, the reference, it can hardly be doubted, is to the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani.</span> It is true the wood of this species is neither beautiful nor remarkably durable. Dr. Lindley calls it the "worthless, though magnificent cedar," but the former adjective, however true it may be of English-grown cedar, cannot justly be applied to the tree of the Lebanon mountain. The writer has some wood in his possession, brought by him from the Lebanon, and though it has neither fragrance nor veining, it is unmistakably a hard and resinous wood. And it should be remembered that it was only employed by Solomon in the <span class="accented">interior</span> of the temple, and was there, for the most part, overlaid with gold, and that the climate of Palestine is much less destructive than our own. There seems to be no sufficient reason, therefore, for rejecting the traditional and till recently universal belief that the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span> was the timber chosen for the temple use. Mr. Houghton, in Smith's Dict. Bib., vol. 3. App. A. p. 40, who speaks of it "as being <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> firmest and grandest of the conifers," says at the same time that "it has no particular quality to recommend it for building purposes; it was probably therefore not very extensively used in the construction of the temple." But no other tree can be suggested which better suits the conditions of the sacred narrative. The <span class="accented">deodara</span>, which has found favour with some writers, it is now positively stated, does not grow near the Lebanon. It may be added that, under the name of <span class="accented">Eres, the</span> yew was probably included. The timber used in the palaces of Nineveh, which was long believed to be cedar, is now proved to be yew (Dict. Bib., art. "Cedar"). However it is certain that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;</span> is a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> which includes, at any rate, the pine, the cedar, and the juniper, in confirmation of which it may be mentioned that at the present day, "the name <span class="accented">arz is</span> applied by the Arabs to all three" (Royle, in Kitto's Cyclop., art. "Eres"). The Grove of Cedars now numbers about 450 trees, great and small. Of these about a dozen are of prodigious size and considerable antiquity, possibly carrying us back (as the natives think) to the time of Solomon. Their precise age, however, can only be a matter of conjecture. The identification of the "fir" is even more precarious than that of the cedar. Celsius would see in this the true cedar of Lebanon. Others identify it with the juniper (<span class="accented">Juniperus excelsa</span>) or with the <span class="accented">Pinus Halepensis</span>, but most writers (among whom are Keil and Bahr) believe the evergreen cypress (<span class="accented">Cupressus sempervirens</span>) to be intended. Very probably the name <span class="accented">Berosh</span> comprehended two or three different species, as the cypress, the juniper, and the savine. The first named grows even near the summits of the mountain. Bahr says it is inferior to cedar (but see above). According to Winer, it is well fitted for building purposes, as" it is not eaten by worms, and is almost imperishable and very light." It is certainly of a harder and closer grain, and more durable than the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani.</span> It shows the brevity of our account that Solomon has not mentioned his desire for "fir" as well as" cedar." This is disclosed in Hiram's reply, and in the parallel passage of the chronicler. It is also to be noticed that in the text the request for <span class="accented">materials</span> is more prominently brought to view, while in Chronicles the petition is for <span class="accented">workmen.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 Here is Solomon's design to build a temple. There is no adversary, no Satan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or to divert from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. When there is no evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that which is good, and get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours. And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17. Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of another, and is benefitted by another, that there may be dependence on one another, to the glory of God.</body></html>
