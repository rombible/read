but in the lower ranges there is still--probably in old times there was to a far greater extent--a rich abundance of timber, specially precious to the comparatively treeless country of Palestine. The forest of Lebanon was proverbial for its beauty and fragrance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-11.htm" title="Your lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/14-6.htm" title="His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.">Hosea 14:6-7</a>), watered by the streams from the snowy heights (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-14.htm" title="Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which comes from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?">Jeremiah 18:14</a>), when all Palestine was parched up. The cedars which now remain--a mere group, at a height of about six thousand feet--are but a remnant of the once magnificent forest which "the Lord had planted" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-16.htm" title="The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;">Psalm 104:16</a>). Solomon's request--couched almost in the language of command--is simply for cedar wood, or rather, for skilled labour in felling and working it, for which the Tyrians were proverbially famed in all ancient records. For this labour he offers to pay; while he seems to take for granted a right for his own servants to come and bring away the timber itself. Hiram's answer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm" title="And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which you sent to me for: and I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.">1Kings 5:8</a>) mentions "timber of fir" also, which agrees exactly with the fuller account of Solomon's request given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm" title="Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,">2Chronicles 2:8</a>. The pine still grows abundantly in the sandstone regions of Lebanon; but it is almost certain that "the fir" here named is the cypress.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> Lebanon, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the White (<span class="accented">so.</span> mountain). "It is the <span class="accented">Merit Blanc</span> of Palestine" (Porter); but whether it is so called because of its summits of snow or because of the colour of its limestone is uncertain. Practically, the cedars are now found in one place only, though Ehrenberg is said to have found them in considerable numbers to the north of the road between Baalbek and Tripoli. "At the head of Wady Kadisha there is a vast recess in the central ridge of Lebanon, some eight miles in diameter. Above it rise the loftiest summits in Syria, streaked with perpetual snow... In the very centre of this recess, on a little irregular knoll, stands the clump of cedars" (<span class="accented">Ibid.</span>, Handbook, 2 p. 584), over 6,000 feet above the level of the sea. It would seem as if that part of Lebanon where the cedars grew belonged to Hiram's dominion. "The northern frontier of Canaan did not reach as far as Bjerrsh" (Keil), where the cedar grove is now. The idea of some older writers that the cedars belonged to Solomon, and that he only asked Hiram for artificers ("that they <span class="accented">hew</span> me cedar trees," etc.) is negatived by ver. 10. It is true that "all Lebanon" was given to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), but they did not take it. They did not drive out the Zidonians (ver. 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>) or possess" the land of the Giblites" (ver. 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>). It should be stated here, however, that the cedar of Scripture probably included other varieties than that which now, alone bears the name (see on ver. 8)], <span class="cmt_word">and my servants shall be with Shy servants</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, sharing and lightening the work]: <span class="cmt_word">and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants</span> [Solomon engaged to pay and did pay both Hiram and his subjects for the services of the latter, and he paid both in kind. See below, on ver. 11] <span class="cmt_word">according to all that thou shalt appoint</span> [This would seem to have been 20,000 measures of wheat and 20 measures of pure oil annually, ver. 11]: <span class="cmt_word">for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">knoweth</span>, same word as before] <span class="cmt_word">to hew timber like unto the Zidonlans</span> [<span class="accented">Propter vicina nemora.</span> Grotius, <span class="accented">Sidou</span> (Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>), means "fishing." See note on ver. 18. By profane, as well as sacred writers, the Phoenicians are often described by the name Zidonians, no doubt for the reason mentioned in the note on ver. 1. See Homer, Iliad 6:290; 23. 743; Odys. 4:84, 618; 17:4.24. Cf. Virg. AEn. 1. 677, 678; 4:545, etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1, 33</a>, etc. "The mechanical skill of the Phoenicians generally, and of the Zidonians in particular, is noticed by many ancient writers," Rawlinson, who cites instances in his note. But what deserves especial notice here is the fact that the Zidonians constructed their houses of <span class="accented">wood</span>, and were celebrated from the earliest times as skilful builders. The fleets which the Phoenicians constructed for purposes of commerce would ensure them a supply of clever workmen. Wordsworth aptly remarks on the part the heathen thus took in rearing a temple for the God of Jacob. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10, 13</a>.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 Here is Solomon's design to build a temple. There is no adversary, no Satan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or to divert from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. When there is no evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that which is good, and get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours. And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17. Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of another, and is benefitted by another, that there may be dependence on one another, to the glory of God.</body></html>
