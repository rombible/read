The commerce and wealth of the Tyrians collected a large population; the narrow slip of land along the coast, backed by Lebanon, must have been, in any case, insufficient to maintain them; an<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My servants shall bring them</span> [No word in the Hebrew; "Timber of Cedar," etc., must be supplied or understood from the preceding verse] <span class="cmt_word">down</span> [It is generally a steep descent from the cedar grove, and indeed all the Lebanon district, to the coast] <span class="cmt_word">from</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lebanon unto the sea</span> [This must have been a great undertaking. The cedars are ten hours distant from Tripoli, and the road must always have been a bad one. ("What a road it is for mortals. In some spots it seems to have been intended for mountain goats only ..... It winds up sublime glens, and zigzags up rocky acclivities, and passes over stone-strewn terraces," etc. (Porter, Handbook, p. 583.) To the writer it appeared to be the most rugged and dangerous road in Palestine. It is possible that the timber was collected and floated at Gebal (Biblus. See note on ver. 18). Beyrout, the present port of the Lebanon, is 27 hours distant <span class="accented">via Tripoli.</span> But cedars would then, no doubt, be found nearer the sea. And the ancients (as the stones of Baalbek, etc., prove) were not altogether deficient in mechanical appliances. The transport of cedars to the Mediterranean would be an easy undertaking compared with the carriage of them to Nineveh, and we know from the inscriptions that they were imported by the Assyrian kings] <span class="cmt_word">and I will convey them by se</span>a in floats [Heb. "<span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will make</span> (or put) <span class="accented">them rafts in the sea."</span> This was the primitive, as it was the obvious, way, of conveying timber, among Greeks and Romans, as well as among Eastern races. The reader will probably have seen such rafts on the Rhine or other river] <span class="cmt_word">unto the place which</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt appoint</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">send</span>] me [In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>, Hiram assumes that this place will be Joppa, now Yafo, the port of Jerusalem, and 40 miles distant from the Holy City. The transport over these 40 miles, also of most rugged and trying road, must have involved, if possible, a still greater toil than that from Lebanon to the sea] <span class="cmt_word">and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">do</span>, same word as in ver. 8, and probably used designedly - "I will perform thy desire.., and thou shalt perform my desire." There shall be a strict <span class="accented">quid pro quo</span>] <span class="cmt_word">my desire, in giving food for my household</span> [Hiram states in his reply in what shape he would prefer the hire promised by Solomon (ver. 6). The food for the royal <span class="accented">household</span> must be carefully distinguished from the food given to the <span class="accented">workmen</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-10.htm">2 Chronicles 2:10</a>). The fact that 20,000 ears of wheat formed a part of each has led to their being confounded (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the marginal references). It is noticeable that when the <span class="accented">second</span> temple was built, cedar wood was again brought to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">rid</span> Joppa, in return for "meat and drink and oil unto them of Zidon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>). The selection of <span class="accented">food</span> as the hire of his servants by Hiram almost amounts to an undesigned coincidence. Their narrow strip of cornland, between the roots of Lebanon and the coast - Phoenicia proper ("the great plain of the city of Sidon," Josephus. Ant. 5:03, 1) is only 28 miles long, with an average breadth of one mile-compelled the importation of corn and oil. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:17) mentions wheat, honey, oil, and balm as exported from Palestine to the markets of Tyre. It has been justly remarked that the fact that Phoenicia was thus dependent upon Palestine for its breadstuffs explains the unbroken peace that prevailed between the two countries (Heeren. See Dict. Bib. if. p. 865). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 Here is Solomon's design to build a temple. There is no adversary, no Satan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or to divert from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. When there is no evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that which is good, and get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours. And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17. Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of another, and is benefitted by another, that there may be dependence on one another, to the glory of God.</body></html>
