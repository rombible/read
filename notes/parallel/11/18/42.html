Possibly it is characteristic of the vehement excitement of the moment, and of the impulsive nature of Elijah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">head</span>] <span class="cmt_word">of Carmel</span> [It is clear from Ver. 43 that this was not the actual summit, nor can it have been, as Bahr supposes, the outermost promontory towards the sea, unless he means the foot or slope of that ridge or promontory, for from this <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> the sea was not visible. It also appears from the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> of ver. 44 that this point must have been at a lower elevation than the plateau where the altar had stood and where Ahab's tent was]<span class="cmt_word">; and he cast himself down upon the earth</span> [Same word <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34, 35</a>, of Elisha's prostration upon the dead child. But if Elijah "stretched himself full length" upon the earth, as the Easterns constantly do in prayer (see Thomson, 1:26, 27) it was but for a moment, as we presently find him kneeling], <span class="cmt_word">and put his face between his knees.</span> ["The Oriental attitude of entire abstraction" (Stanley). The posture witnessed to the intensity of his supplication.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:41-46 Israel, being so far reformed as to acknowledge the Lord to be God, and to consent to the execution of Baal's prophets, was so far accepted, that God poured out blessing upon the land. Elijah long continued praying. Though the answer of our fervent and believing supplications does not come quickly, we must continue earnest in prayer, and not faint or give over. A little cloud at length appeared, which soon overspread the heavens, and watered the earth. Great blessings often arise from small beginnings, showers of plenty from a cloud of span long. Let us never despise the day of small things, but hope and wait for great things from it. From what small beginnings have great matters arisen! It is thus in all the gracious proceedings of God with the soul. Scarcely to be perceived are the first workings of his Spirit in the heart, which grow up at last to the wonder of men, and applause of angels. Elijah hastened Ahab home, and attended him. God will strengthen his people for every service to which his commandments and providence call them. The awful displays of Divine justice and holiness dismay the sinner, extort confessions, and dispose to outward obedience while the impression lasts; but the view of these, with mercy, love, and truth in Christ Jesus, is needful to draw the soul to self-abasement, trust, and love. The Holy Spirit employs both in the conversion of sinners; when sinners are impressed with Divine truths, they should be exhorted to set about the duties to which the Saviour calls his disciples.</body></html>
