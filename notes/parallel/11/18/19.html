Mount Carmel--rightly called "the park," well planted and watered, of central Palestine--is a limestone ridge, with deep ravines thickly wooded, running north-west for about twelve miles from the central hills of Manasseh, so as to form the south side of the bay of Ptolemais, and almost to reach the sea, leaving, however, a space round which the southern armies constantly poured into the plain of Jezreel. It varies from 600 feet to 1,700 feet in height. Near its higher eastern extremity there is a place still called <span class= "ital">El Maharrakah, </span>"the burning," in view of the plain and city of Jezreel, and commanding from one point a glimpse of the sea, which is the traditional (and highly probable) scene of Elijah's sacrifice. Carmel is previously mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-26.htm" title="And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reaches to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;">Joshua 19:26</a>, as falling to Asher, and the existence of the altar of the Lord shows that, as was natural, it was made one of the "high places," and, indeed, it appears to have been known as such even to the heathen. In the prophetic writings it is referred to as proverbial for its luxuriant pasturage and beauty. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm" title="The earth mourns and languishes: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.">Isaiah 33:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-26.htm" title="I beheld, and, see, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.">Jeremiah 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm" title="And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:">Amos 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-6.htm" title="How fair and how pleasant are you, O love, for delights!">Song of Solomon 7:6</a>.) No more striking scene could well be found for the great drama of this chapter.<p><span class= "bld">The prophets of the groves (<span class= "ital">Asherah</span>)<span class= "ital"> . . .</span></span>--These, being probably the devotees of the female deity Astarte, seem to have been especially favoured by the queen. It is, however, to be noted that, in spite of Elijah's challenge, they do not appear at all in the subsequent scene. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-22.htm" title="Then said Elijah to the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.">1Kings 18:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-40.htm" title="And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.">1Kings 18:40</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by representation, the heads of the people, elders, etc. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2, 65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-16.htm">1 Kings 16:16, 17</a>] <span class="cmt_word">unto Mount Carmel</span> [Heb., as almost always, <span class="accented">the Carmel, i.e.</span>, the park. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1-5</a>. It is "the park of Palestine." It is indebted for this name to the luxuriant vegetation - "the excellency of Carmel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>) - which clothes its southern slopes (Porter, p. 371; Stanley, S. and P. pp. 352-54, and App. p. 14; Van de Velde, 1. pp. 317, 318). It is now generally called <span class="accented">Mar</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Lord or Saint) <span class="accented">Elyas</span>, after the great prophet. No one who has seen the locality can have any doubts as to which part of the mountain was the scene of the sacrifice, or can fail to be struck with the singular fitness of the place to be the theatre of this thrilling history. Carmel is rather a ridge than a mountain, some twelve miles in length. Its western (or strictly N.N.W.) extremity is a bold headland, some 600 feet in height, which dips almost directly into the waters of the Mediterranean. Its highest point, 1728 feet above the sea level, is about four miles from its eastern extremity, which, at an elevation of 1600 feet, rises like a wall from the great plain of Esdraelon. It is at this point, there can be no question, we are to place the scene of the burnt sacrifice. The identification has only been effected in comparatively recent days (1852), but it is beyond dispute. Not only does the Arab name which it bears <span class="accented">- El Murahkah</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">Burning</span>," or "<span class="accented">Sacrifice"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> afford striking witness to the identity, but the situation and surroundings adapt themselves with such wonderful precision to the requirements of the narrative as to leave no reasonable doubt in the mind. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it is a sort of natural platform, or pulpit, raised 1000 feet above the adjoining plain, and therefore well calculated to afford a view of the proceedings, or at least of the descent of the Holy Fire, to spectators of all Israel. The flame would probably be seen by Jezebel in her palace at Jezreel. This eminence is visible from Nazareth, some twenty miles away. "There is not a more conspicuous spot on all Carmel than the abrupt, rocky height of El Murahkah, shooting up so suddenly on the east" (Van de Velde, 1. pp. 322, 323). "The summit... commands the last view of the sea behind and the first view of the great plain in front" (Stanley). In fact, it was in its way just as well adapted for the solemn vindication of the law which took place there as <span class="accented">Jebel Sufsafeh</span> was for the giving of the law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A sort of plateau near the summit - the table land where the altars were built, etc. - would accommodate a vast number of spectators (ver. 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> There is a spring of water close at hand - less than 100 yards distant - and a spring which is said to flow even in the driest seasons, which would supply the water of which we read in vers. 4, 33-35. Josephus (Ant. 8:13, 5) says it came from the fountain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The sea, though not visible from the plateau itself, is seen from a point some 300 feet higher, a detail which accords admirably with the account of vers. 42-44. It may be added that the place is still held sacred by the Druses, and reverenced by "Jews, Christians, Moslems, and Bedouin as the site of these miracles of Elijah" (Thomson). The traveller, consequently, cannot doubt for a moment, as he stands on the table-land of <span class="accented">El</span> <span class="accented">Murahkah</span> and looks across the great plain to Jezreel and the heights of Galilee and Samaria, that he is on the very spot sanctified by the descent of the heavenly fire. It should be added, as explaining the selection of Carmel by Elijah, that its situation is central end convenient; that it is near the sea, from whence the rain clouds would come; that it is easy of access from Jezreel; and that it was not only a holy place from earlier times (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), but also had its altar of Jehovah, an altar, no doubt, in constant use when the people "sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places," but which had in later days fallen into neglect, and was now broken down. It was every way, therefore, a <span class="accented">most appropriate</span> locality for the public vindication of the despised and outraged law of God. "No place could be conceived more fitted by nature to be that wondrous battlefield of truth" (Tristram in Wordsworth)], <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">the prophets of Baal</span> [so called not because they were <span class="accented">Weissager und Verkunder</span> (Bahr) of the god, nor yet because they were teachers and emissaries of his religion, but because of the prophetic frenzy (ver. 28) into which they worked themselves (Keil)] <span class="cmt_word">four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">of the Asherah, i.e.</span>, of Astarte, not "grove," as 'Rawlinson.

He reminds us that we find 400 prophets at the close of his reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>), and also remarks on "the prevalence of the number 40 in the religious systems of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-24.htm">Exodus 36:24, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>, etc.) " But when it is remembered that Baal's prophets were 450, and the prophets of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a> were <span class="accented">about</span> 400 men, the solitary instance of the 400 prophets of Astarte - who, by the way, were Jezebel's rather than Ahab's ministers - affords but a slender basis for his conclusion], <span class="cmt_word">which eat at Jezebel's table.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">eaters of</span>. There is nothing in the Hebrew to imply that they sat with her at the same board; and it is certain that this would be altogether repugnant to Eastern ideas of propriety.
