Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-54.htm">Luke 12:54</a>, "When ye see the cloud (Gr. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) arise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is." "Still in autumn the little cloud comes up like a man's hand and swells till huge thunder pillars are piled black and high above the mountains" (Condor). But it is not in Palestine alone that a little cloud on the horizon is frequently the harbinger of rain]. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Go up</span> [see note on ver. 42], <span class="cmt_word">say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bind</span>]<span class="cmt_word"></span>, <span class="accented">and get thee down</span> [Keil, Stanley, and others assume that Ahab's chariot was waiting at the foot of the mountain. But it is to be noticed that the command to harness the horses precedes that to "go down." The writer <span class="accented">rode</span> down from <span class="accented">El Murahkah</span> to the plain, and it is quite conceivable that the royal chariot may have conveyed Ahab to the plateau of sacrifice and have waited for him there], <span class="cmt_word">that the rain stop thee not,</span> [After heavy rain (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) the Kishon, which "collects the whole drainage of this large basin" (Conder), the Great Plain, soon becomes an impassable swamp.(<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>), "I can tell you from experience that in wet seasons it (the Wady) is extremely muddy, and then the Kishon causes great tribulation to the muleteers. Rarely indeed do they get over it without some of their animals sticking fast in its oozy bottom" (Thomson, L. and B. 2. p. 218).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:41-46 Israel, being so far reformed as to acknowledge the Lord to be God, and to consent to the execution of Baal's prophets, was so far accepted, that God poured out blessing upon the land. Elijah long continued praying. Though the answer of our fervent and believing supplications does not come quickly, we must continue earnest in prayer, and not faint or give over. A little cloud at length appeared, which soon overspread the heavens, and watered the earth. Great blessings often arise from small beginnings, showers of plenty from a cloud of span long. Let us never despise the day of small things, but hope and wait for great things from it. From what small beginnings have great matters arisen! It is thus in all the gracious proceedings of God with the soul. Scarcely to be perceived are the first workings of his Spirit in the heart, which grow up at last to the wonder of men, and applause of angels. Elijah hastened Ahab home, and attended him. God will strengthen his people for every service to which his commandments and providence call them. The awful displays of Divine justice and holiness dismay the sinner, extort confessions, and dispose to outward obedience while the impression lasts; but the view of these, with mercy, love, and truth in Christ Jesus, is needful to draw the soul to self-abasement, trust, and love. The Holy Spirit employs both in the conversion of sinners; when sinners are impressed with Divine truths, they should be exhorted to set about the duties to which the Saviour calls his disciples.</body></html>
