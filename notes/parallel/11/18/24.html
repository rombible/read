In this instance the worship of Baal was a worship of the power of Nature, impersonated perhaps in the sun; and the miracle therefore entered (so to speak) on the visible sphere, especially usurped in his name, in order to claim it for the Lord Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And call ye on the name of your gods</span> [As Elijah is still addressing the people, not the prophets of Baal (see ver. 25), this change of person is significant. He sorrowfully assumes that they have taken Baal and Astarte for their gods], <span class="cmt_word">and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">he</span> shall be <span class="accented">the God, i.e.</span>, the true God and their God. Cf. ver. 39. Not only was a "sign from heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11</a>) ever esteemed a more powerful and direct proof of Divine energy - perhaps as being less liable to be counterfeited, and as excluding the idea of the operation of infernal powers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>) - but it must be remembered that Baal claimed to be the Sun god and Lord of the elements and forces of nature; while Jehovah bad already, according to the law, identified Himself with this token (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>). Indeed, this sign had a double fit. ness as a test of the true religion. It would not only put the <span class="accented">powers</span> of the rival deities to the proof; it would also at the same time decide which of the rival systems of worship was acceptable to the Supreme Being. It is observable that there is no mention of rain. We might have expected, after the long drought, that this would be the test. But that could not be promised until the Lord had first been recognized as God.] <span class="cmt_word">And all the people answered and said, Is well spoken.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Good the word</span>. They accepted Elijah's proposition, but whether eagerly or reluctantly it is difficult to say. The Hebrew merely conveys that they admitted its fairness and reasonableness. Having gained the assent of the people, for whose verdict he and the Baal prophets were now contending, and who were, consequently, entitled to be consulted as to the sign which would satisfy them, he turns to the band of 400 prophets, who, probably in all the bravery of their sacrificial vestments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-22.htm">2 Kings 10:22</a>), occupied a separate position on the hill top, between the king and the people, and repeats his proposal to them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:21-40 Many of the people wavered in their judgment, and varied in their practice. Elijah called upon them to determine whether Jehovah or Baal was the self-existent, supreme God, the Creator, Governor, and Judge of the world, and to follow him alone. It is dangerous to halt between the service of God and the service of sin, the dominion of Christ and the dominion of our lusts. If Jesus be the only Saviour, let us cleave to him alone for every thing; if the Bible be the world of God, let us reverence and receive the whole of it, and submit our understanding to the Divine teaching it contains. Elijah proposed to bring the matter to a trial. Baal had all the outward advantages, but the event encourages all God's witnesses and advocates never to fear the face of man. The God that answers by fire, let him be God: the atonement was to be made by sacrifice, before the judgment could be removed in mercy. The God therefore that has power to pardon sin, and to signify it by consuming the sin-offering, must needs be the God that can relieve from the calamity. God never required his worshippers to honour him in the manner of the worshippers of Baal; but the service of the devil, though sometimes it pleases and pampers the body, yet, in other things, really is cruel to it, as in envy and drunkenness. God requires that we mortify our lusts and corruptions; but bodily penances and severities are no pleasure to him. Who has required these things at your hands? A few words uttered in assured faith, and with fervent affection for the glory of God, and love to the souls of men, or thirstings after the Lord's image and his favour, form the effectual, fervent prayer of the righteous man, which availeth much. Elijah sought not his own glory, but that of God, for the good of the people. The people are all agreed, convinced, and satisfied; Jehovah, he is the God. Some, we hope, had their hearts turned, but most of them were convinced only, not converted. Blessed are they that have not seen what these saw, yet have believed, and have been wrought upon by it, more than they that saw it.</body></html>
