Mr. Fergusson considers that they were supports to the roof of the vestibule; and if this were thirty cubits high, the twenty-seven cubits of each pillar, allowing for the slope of the roof to the apex, would suit well enough. But the absence of all reference to their position as parts of the building, and the entire separation of the description of their fabrication from the account of the building itself, rather favoured the other supposition, that they were isolated pillars set up in front of the porch as symbolic monuments, conveying the idea of Psalms 46, "God is our hope and strength;" "God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed." It is particularly noticed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2Kings 25:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm" title="Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/52-20.htm" title="The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.">Jeremiah 52:20-23</a>) that they were broken up by the Chaldaeans. on the capture of Jerusalem, and the brass carried away. The description is exceedingly elaborate, and, except in one or two parts, clear enough. The shaft of each pillar was twenty-seven feet high, and its diameter something less than six feet. Josephus says that it was hollow, but of considerable thickness. Above the shaft was a chapiter (or capital) of great proportionate size (seven and a half feet high), covered with a net-work and festoons of metal-work, and ornamented with two rows of pomegranates, a hundred in each row. Over these again was "lily-work" of six feet in height--probably some conventionalised foliage, technically known by that name, like the "honeysuckle ornament" in classical architecture, or the conventional "dog-tooth" or "ball-flower" of Gothic. The whole height, even if there were no base or plinth below, would be twenty-seven cubits, or forty feet and a half. In the Dict. of the Bible (TEMPLE) is given a drawing of a pillar at Persepolis, which bears a considerable resemblance to the general description here given, but, being executed in stone, is far less elaborate in ornamentation. The whole style of the narrative shows that these were regarded as monuments of the highest artistic skill, and well known to all, as from their position they would be constantly before the eyes both of priests and people. There was, so far as can be seen, nothing to correspond to them in the Tabernacle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he cast two pillars of brass</span> [The process of casting, as practised by the ancients, receives considerable illustration from the paintings of Thebes (see Wilkinson, "Anc.

To this must be added the capital (vers. 16, 19), which measured five (or, according to some, nine) cubits, and probably the pedestal. The pillars were hollow, the metal being four finger breadths thick (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a> the height is given as thirty-five cubits - a discrepancy which has been variously explained. According to some writers (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Abravanel, Movers, Wordsworth), this represents the total length of the <span class="accented">two</span> pillars (each pillar consequently being 17.5 cubits) - an idea which, perhaps, finds some slight support in the word employed <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span> <span class="accented">length.</span> Here it <span class="accented">is</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5ea;&#x5d4;&#x5d2;&#x5da;&#x5da;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> By others it has been supposed that the total height of base, column, and capital was thirty-five cubits, which, if not incredible, is very improbable. Others think it a part of that systematic reduplication of the heights of edifices by the chronicler, of which we have already had an instance in ch. 6. (where see note). But the true explanation would seem to be that, by a clerical error, thirty-five (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>) has been substituted in the text for eighteen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;</span>). So Keil and Bahr]: <span class="cmt_word">and a line</span> [or <span class="accented">thread</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of twelve cubits did compass either of them</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the second column</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>about</span>. [It must not be supposed, from the fact that the height of the one column is given, and the circumference of the other, that they were dissimilar in height and breadth or girth. There has probably been an accidental abbreviation of the full expression, "Eighteen cubits was the height of the one pillar, and eighteen cubits was the height of the other pillar; and a line of twelve cubits compassed the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits compassed the other pillar." It is just possible, however, that the peculiarity results from the actual system of measurement employed in this case. As they were castings, it would be needless to measure both pillars, and so the length may have been ascertained from the first, and the breadth from the second. The columns would thus be about twenty-seven feet high, and about six feet in diameter.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-47 The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were to teach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strength and establishment in all their religious exercises. Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.</body></html>
