"It seems almost in vain to try and speculate on what was the exact form of the decoration of these celebrated pillars. The nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, etc., are all features applicable to metal architecture; and though we know that the old Tartar races did use metal architecture everywhere, and especially in bronze, from the very nature of the material, every specimen has perished, and we have now no representations from which we can restore them" (Fergusson, Dict. Bib. <span class="accented">l.c.</span>)] <span class="cmt_word">of checker work</span> [the Hebrew repeats the word: nets of <span class="accented">network</span>, or plaits of work of plait], <span class="cmt_word">and wreaths</span> [or cords, twisted work, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, festoons] <span class="cmt_word">of chain work</span> [the wreathed or twisted festoon probably resembled a chain], <span class="cmt_word">for</span> [or, to, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, were on] <span class="cmt_word">the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven</span> for <span class="cmt_word">the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter</span> [The <span class="accented">LXX.</span> having here <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, it is clear that the text they had read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5db;&#x5d4;</span> "a net," and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5d4;</span> "seven." Some, accordingly, would read, "a net for the one chapiter, and a net," etc. But there is no sufficient reason for the change. "This decoration consisted of seven twists arranged as festoons, which were hung round the capitals of the pillars" (Keil). The comparison with "chain work" was probably suggestd by the fact that the intertwined threads, which crossed and recrossed each other, bore a rough resemblance to the links of a chain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-47 The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were to teach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strength and establishment in all their religious exercises. Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.</body></html>
