Some of the details of the description are obscure, and it is clear that our translators were very much at fault about them. Generally, however, it appears that each base was a kind of hollow chest, 6 feet square on plan, and 4ï¿½ feet high, having at the angles pilasters or fillets ("ledges" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-28.htm" title="And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:">1Kings 7:28</a>), with panels on each side ("borders" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-28.htm" title="And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:">1Kings 7:28</a>), ornamented with "lions, oxen, and cherubims," below which hung festoons of thin metal-work--("certain additions made of thin work," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-29.htm" title="And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and on the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.">1Kings 7:29</a>). Each base was set on four brazen wheels with brazen axles ("plates" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-30.htm" title="And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.">1Kings 7:30</a>) only 27 inches high, and with naves, felloes, and spokes, all cast in brass. On each base was a convex circular stand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-35.htm" title="And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.">1Kings 7:35</a>), with a "mouth," or circular opening (apparently "the chapiter" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm" title="And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also on the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.">1Kings 7:31</a>), upon which, or over which, the laver stood. This was nine inches high, ornamented with carvings of "cherubims, lions, and palm-trees." From the four corners of the upper surface of the base sprang "undersetters," apparently brackets helping to support the laver, which rested above the "mouth" of the convex stand, and to keep it fast in its place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-30.htm" title="And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.">1Kings 7:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-34.htm" title="And there were four supports to the four corners of one base: and the supports were of the very base itself.">1Kings 7:34</a>). The laver was 6 feet in diameter, and held 40 baths, or about 360 gallons. The whole stood high, no doubt to bring it nearly on a level with the brazen altar, which was 15 feet high. In form, perhaps, each laver was a smaller copy of the molten sea. Of the whole a conjectural description and sketch are given in the <span class= "ital">Dictionary</span> <span class= "ital">of the Bible</span>, art.

Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.</body></html>
