It seems evidently to have enclosed the whole palace, and may have contained quarters for the guards and the household. There must have been, of course, inner courts, round which both the more public and the more private buildings of the palace were grouped.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the great court round about</span> [The palace, again like the temple, had two courts. The lesser is referred to in ver. 8, and was enclosed among the buildings. The great court probably surrounded the entire structure] <span class="cmt_word">was</span> [enclosed by a wall] <span class="cmt_word">with three rows of</span> hewed <span class="cmt_word">stones, and a row of cedar beams</span> [The latter formed the coping. The wall of the court of the palace thus resembled that of the temple. See on 1 Kings 6:36. In all these coincidences we have tokens of the same designing hand], <span class="cmt_word">both for the inner court of the house of the Lord.</span> [This sudden digression from the court of the palace to the temple is suspicious, and suggests either a mistranslation or corruption of the text. The historian evidently meant to say that the wall of the court, in its three rows of stones and its cedar coping, resembled the inner court of the temple; and, according to some grammarians (Gesen., Ewald), this meaning may well be conveyed by the text as it stands, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> in Hebrew serving sometimes to institute a comparison (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-3.htm">Proverbs 25:3, 12, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-14.htm">Proverbs 26:14</a>, etc.) "As in the court," etc. But the instances just cited, being proverbs or apophthegms, are not strictly parallel with our text. It seems better, on the whole, however, to retain the text in this sense than to replace. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d4;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> (Horsley) is quite inadmissible, as the constr, case never has the art.], <span class="cmt_word">and for the porch of the house.</span> [It is almost impossible to decide whether the porch of judgment (ver. 7) or the porch of the temple is here meant. The immediate context favours the latter. But this does not seem to have had any court or enclosing wall other than the inner court. Rawlinson decides for the porch of judgment, "which," he says, "had a planking of cedar over the stone pavement" (ver. 7). But ver. 7 (where see note) rather excludes than in-eludes the pavement. The reference is probably to the "court within the porch," mentioned in ver. 8.] After this brief account of the royal palaces, the author proceeds to mention the vessels, etc., used in the temple service, prefacing his description by a few words respecting the great Tyrian artist, by whom they were for the most part cast, and possibly designed also. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-12 All Solomon's buildings, though beautiful, were intended for use. Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then his other buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laid in early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact, but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's. We ought to prefer God's honour before our own ease and satisfaction.</body></html>
