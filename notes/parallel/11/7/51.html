The accumulation was enormous. It had evidently been the work of years to gather it out of the spoils of many victories, offered in that spirit of thankful devotion which is expressed in David's own words: "Both riches and honour come of thee . . . and of thine own have we given unto thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-12.htm" title="Both riches and honor come of you, and you reign over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.">1Chronicles 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-14.htm" title="But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.">1Chronicles 29:14</a>).
