and so covered the altar which was of cedar.">1Kings 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm" title="And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.">1Kings 6:22</a>) is the altar of incense. On it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it.">Exodus 30:1-10</a>) incense was to be burnt morning and evening. The horns of the altar were to be touched with the blood of the sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm" title="And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-18.htm" title="And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:18</a>) offered for the priests or the people; and it was to be solemnly purified by the blood of the sacrifice on the great Day of Atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-18.htm" title="And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.">Leviticus 16:18-19</a>). The offering of incense, therefore, pre-supposed sacrifice already offered, and atonement made for sin. To the Israelites it clearly symbolised the offering of an acceptable worship by man, as restored to the love and communion of God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>.) The priest, as a mediator between God and man, alone entered the Holy Place and offered the incense; the people "stood praying without" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-10.htm" title="And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.">Luke 1:10</a>). To us it symbolises the intercession of the One Mediator, offered for us in the Most Holy Place of heaven, by whom alone our worship ascends to God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a>.)<p>For the table of shewbread, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-23.htm" title="You shall also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:23-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/37-10.htm" title="And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:">Exodus 37:10-15</a>; for the shewbread itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/24-5.htm" title="And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>. The "shewbread"--properly "bread of the face" (or presence) of God, translated in the LXX. Version as "bread of offering" or "of presentation"--was clearly of the nature of an Eucharistic offering to God of His own gift of bread--a kind of first-fruits, acknowledging that the whole sustenance of life comes from Him, and possibly also implying the truth more closely symbolised by the pot of manna, that "man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word proceeding out of the mouth of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Solomon made all the vessels which pertained unto</span> [neither word in Heb.] <span class="cmt_word">the house of the Lord: the altar of gold</span> [the altar of incense.

Let us come to him, and wash away our sins in his blood; let us seek for the purifying grace of his Spirit; let us maintain communion with the Father through his intercession, and yield up ourselves and all we have to his service. Being strengthened by him, we shall be accepted, useful, and happy.</body></html>
