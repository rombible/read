It had also a porch of its own, with a threshold (for the last clause of the verse should be rendered, "and a porch before it with pillars, and a threshold before them,") forming a kind of plinth, or, possibly, a flight of steps.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made a porch of pillars</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the porch of pillars.</span> This was no doubt a covered colonnade, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, it had a roof but no sides. The pillars were its only walls. But here the question presents itself, Was this porch the vestibule of the house of the forest of Lebanon, just described? From the correspondence between its width and that of this palace, Rawlinson infers that it was (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2, 3</a>). Bahr believes it to have been the porch or entrance to the hall of judgment mentioned in the next verse, while Fergusson again assigns it an independent position, separate from either. The <span class="accented">term porch</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), the meaning of which is surely determined by its use in ch. 6, almost implies that it must have served as the entrance or vestibule to some building. But the size, and the fact that it had itself a porch (see below), favour the idea that it was an independent structure, though Rawlinson shows that "most of the Persepolitan porches had small pillared chambers at some little distance in front of them," and refers to the Egyptian <span class="accented">propylaea</span>. Keil argues that this <span class="accented">pillar hall</span>, as he calls it, stood between the house of the forest of Lebanon and the judgment hall. Bahr, as remarked above, sees in it the anterior part of the judgment hall, which latter, he adds, bore to it the same relation that the oracle did to the temple house. He observes that as the ark was in the oracle, so the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>) found a place in the hall of judgment. This structure, therefore, with its porch, mentioned presently, would reproduce the main features of the temple arrangement. We see, consequently, that both the house of the forest of Lebanon and the porch of pillars followed in their outline the ground plan of the temple. Nor is this at all surprising, considering that all these edifices probably had the same architect or designer]; <span class="cmt_word">the length thereof was fifty cubits</span> [the length, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the view last advanced of the two divisions of the building, viz., the porch of pillars and the porch of judgment. But the correspondence of the length (or width - the same word is used of the width of the <span class="accented">temple</span> porch <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>) of this porch with the width of the house of the forest of Lebanon is, to say the least, remarkable, and suggests that after all it may have been the porch of that building. If so, the resemblance to the temple would be still more striking], <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth</span> [depth?] <span class="cmt_word">thereof thirty cubits: and</span> <span class="cmt_word">the porch</span> [Heb. a porch] <span class="cmt_word">was before them</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the pillars. The words can only mean that a smaller porch stood before the porch of pillars, or colonnade]: <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">the other</span> [omit] <span class="cmt_word">pillars</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the pillars of the minor vestibule or fore porch] <span class="cmt_word">and the thick beam</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">threshold</span>] <span class="cmt_word">were before them.</span> [The broad threshold, approached by steps, and the pillars which it supported, together with the roof which covered them, formed the front part and approach to the larger porch or colonnade.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-12 All Solomon's buildings, though beautiful, were intended for use. Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then his other buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laid in early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact, but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's. We ought to prefer God's honour before our own ease and satisfaction.</body></html>
