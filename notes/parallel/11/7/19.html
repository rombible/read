Probably the bowl-shaped chapiter was treated as a fullblown lily, just as the capitals of Egyptian pillars took the form of the lotus. The molten sea was similarly treated (ver. 26). The lily (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>), <span class="accented">to be white</span>), was undoubtedly an emblem of purity.

Keil understands" as in the hall" (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, LXX.) But that idea would have been expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, and nothing is said elsewhere about any lily work in the porch (Bahr). Ewald, too, thinks the decoration of the porch is referred to, and holds that a description of this lily work must once have preceded this statement, though it is now wanting. Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>. suppose them to refer to the position of the pillars within the porch, and the "four cubits" mentioned presently, they take to indicate the diameter of the capitals. Wordsworth would render "inside or <span class="accented">toward</span> the porch," and understands that the lily work was only on the <span class="accented">inside</span> of the pillars. It is, perhaps, impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion], <span class="cmt_word">four cubits</span>. [This may either mean that of five cubits (which was the height of the entire capital), four, and these the upper four (ver. 22), were covered with lily work, while one cubit at the bottom of the capital was ornamented with chain-work or festeons - we can hardly believe that nets, chains, and lily work were all combined in the same space, or it may refer to the position of the pillars in the portico.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-47 The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were to teach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strength and establishment in all their religious exercises. Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.</body></html>
