There must, however, have been first a bulging inwards, immediately under the rim: for the right translation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-26.htm" title="And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was worked like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.">1Kings 7:26</a> declares that the rim was in "the form of a lily flower," that is, curving outwards. Under the rim ran a double row of "gourd ornaments," like those carved in the cedar-panelling of the Temple. The sea stood on twelve oxen, corresponding perhaps to the twelve tribes of Israel--the ox being possibly the same emblem which was used in the form of the cherubim--till it was taken down and placed on the pavement by Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm" title="And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it on the pavement of stones.">2Kings 16:17</a>), and, like the great pillars, was broken up at last by the Chaldeans for the sake of the brass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2Kings 25:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - The writer now passes on to describe the brazen vessels made by Hiram for the temple use. <span class="cmt_word">And he made a</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="cmt_word">molten sea</span> [so called on account of its unprecedented size and capacity. It was designed, like the laver of brass in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-20</a>), to contain the water necessary for the ablutions of the priests.

If the diameter was exactly ten, the circumference would of course be about 31.5 cubits.

Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.</body></html>
