Looked at in itself, it shows that the Temple (like many other buildings in the comparative infancy of architecture) depended for its effect, not so much on size or proportion, as on rich material, elaborate decoration, and costly furniture, on which all the resources both of treasure and art were lavished. But besides this, the sense of the especial sacredness attached to all the vessels of the Temple, which was hereafter to degenerate into a Pharisaic superstition (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-18</a>), suggested the most careful record of every detail, and reverently traced to "the Spirit of God" the gift of "wisdom of heart" "to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass," as in Bezaleel and Aholiab for the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/35-31.htm" title="And he has filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;">Exodus 35:31-32</a>), so also in Hiram for the Temple. There is something especially remarkable in this broad comprehensiveness of conception which recognises the illuminating and inspiring power of the Spirit of God, not only in the moral and religious teaching of the prophet and the devotional utterances of the psalmist, but in the warlike enthusiasm of the Judge, the sagacity of the statesman, the imaginative skill of the artist, and the wisdom of the philosophic thinker. Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the Apostolic declaration: "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:4</a>).<p>(13) <span class= "bld">And king Solomon sent.</span>--The record in the Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-7.htm" title="Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.">2Chronicles 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/2-13.htm" title="And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,">2Chronicles 2:13-14</a>) gives what is evidently a more exact description of the facts here briefly alluded to. In Solomon's first letter to King Hiram he asks for "a man cunning to work," and with the answer the artificer Hiram is sent. His mixed parentage would enable him to enter into the spirit of the Israelite worship, and yet to bring to bear upon it the practical skill of the Tyrian artificer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And king Solomon sent</span> [rather, had sent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</span> [This is our historian's brief version of the transaction which is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-7.htm">2 Chronicles 2:7-14</a>. He has not mentioned before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>) Solomon's request for a master builder. Hiram, like his namesake the king, is elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11, 16</a>) called <span class="accented">Huram</span> or <span class="accented">Hirom</span> (ver. 40). See note on 1 Kings 5:1. In the first of these passages the king calls him "Huram my father" (see note there); in the last he is designated "Huram his father." The title <span class="accented">"Ab"</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a>, 41, 43; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>) shows the high esteem in which he was held. It can hardly be, as some have supposed, a proper name. It may signify "counsellor," or master, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, master builder. The Tyrians evidently <span class="accented">regarded</span> him with some pride.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-47 The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were to teach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strength and establishment in all their religious exercises. Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.</body></html>
