A much more important question is whether the chapiter (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> same word, akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, crown) of four cubits mentioned in ver. 19 is to be understood as a part of this chapiter, or something additional and superposed, the entablature, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> The former appears the more probable. See note on ver. 19. But it is not a fatal objection to the latter view that it would make the entire chapiter, or both members, nine cubits high; no less, that is, than one-half the length of the shaft. No doubt to modern ideas this appears wholly disproportionate; but a double chapiter, bearing the same proportion to the shaft, is found in some of the buildings of Persepolis (Fergusson,. Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1457). From the expression of vers. 41, 42, "the bowls of the chapiters" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">2 Chronicles 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-23.htm">Jeremiah 52:23</a>), and the word "belly" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) in ver. 20, we gather that the chapiters were bowl shaped, or bellied out something like the so called "cushion capital" in Norman architecture. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-47 The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were to teach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strength and establishment in all their religious exercises. Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.</body></html>
