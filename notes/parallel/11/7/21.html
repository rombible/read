And were they architectural or monumental? Did they support the roof of the porch, or were they isolated and detached, after the manner of obelisks? I incline to the opinion of Bahr, that they stood <span class="accented">in</span> the porch, but that they formed no part of the building, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that they were not for any structural use, but simply for ornament. This appears to me, on the whole, to result from the following considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The language used favours a position within the porch. We have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> ( = "<span class="accented">at</span> or <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">the</span> porch," perhaps for the porch, as Bahr), and in ver. 19 (where see note) <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>. And with this agree the expression of the Chronicles "before (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) the house," and "before (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) the temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15, 17</a>). The pillars would, however, be "before the temple," whether they stood within or in front of the porch, and it may be safely allowed that the language of the historian is not <span class="accented">decisive</span> one way or the other. The prepositions of the text, however, seem to lend some support to Bahr's view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We know that the Phoenicians used <span class="accented">isolated</span> metal columns as sacred ornaments, so that Hiram would be familiar with such a mode of ornamentation" (Rawlinson). "Whenever in coins or histories we get a representation of a Phoenician temple, it always has a pillar or pillars standing within or before it" (Stanley). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is extremely doubtful whether these columns, twenty-three feet in height, were adapted to serve as supports to the roof of the porch. The height of the latter has been variously estimated at twenty, thirty, and sixty cubits, and whichever estimate is preferred, the columns would appear to be of an unsuitable altitude. Fergusson says they <span class="accented">were</span> "appropriate to support the roof of the porch," but then he conceives the columns to be in all twenty-seven cubits high (see on ver. 19), and allows the remaining three cubits for the slope of the roof). But, as we cannot be certain either of the height of the porch or of the column, this is an argument of which very little can be made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> If the pillars were part of the building, they would almost certainly have been of the same material, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, wood or stone. Their metallic composition is certainly an argument for their monumental character. It can hardly be alleged in favour of this view, however, that they are mentioned amongst the vessels or articles of furniture, for the historian might fittingly describe the pillars here, as being the principal of the "works in brass" which Hiram wrought, even if they did form the supports of the roof of the porch. Nor are we justified, considering the extreme brevity and the partial character of the description of the temple, in affirming that they would have been mentioned in connexion with the building, had they formed part of the edifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The remark of Stieglitz (cited by Bahr) that "it was their separate position alone which gave these pillars the impressive aspect they were designed to wear," lends some little support to this view. So also does <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The fact that these columns and these alone, received special names. "No architectural portion of the building received a name" (Keil). But this argument, again, is not too unduly pressed, for to some it may seem that the names they bore would have a special propriety and an enhanced significance, if the columns contributed to the <span class="accented">strength and stability</span> of the edifice. The question, therefore, is one of considerable complexity, the more so, as it is maintained that it would be almost impossible to construct a roof thirty feet in width without some such pillars to support the beam (Fergusson); but the balance of evidence appears to favour the view that Jachin and Boaz were monuments erected in the porch, to dignify the sanctuary, and to symbolize the power and eternity of the Being to whom it was dedicated]: <span class="cmt_word">and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin</span> [<span class="accented">i.e., he shall establish</span>, as marg. The name expressed the belief that God would preserve and protect the new lane. It is true that a Jachin is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-17.htm">1 Chronicles 24:17</a>), as head of the 21st course of priests in the reign of David, while a Boaz was one of Solomon's ancestors, but the columns could hardly be named after them, or an private persons. Ewald suggests that they were named after "some favourites of the time, perhaps young sons of Solon on." The idea of Thenius that these names were engraved upon the pillars is not wholly improbable, though of course it finds no support in the text] <span class="cmt_word">and he set up the left pillar</span> [the left as one faced them from the house. The right hand is identified with the south in ver. 39], <span class="cmt_word">and called the name thereof Boaz.</span> [Marg. <span class="accented">in it is strength.</span> Probably "<span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">Him, i.e.</span>, God, is its strength" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>). The thought of Jachin, "<span class="accented">He</span> will establish," is thus continued; and the two pillars pointed alike to the God of Israel as the true support and upholder of His sanctuary. The LXX. interpretation of these two names, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>), <span class="accented">success</span> and <span class="accented">strength</span>, though very far from literal, preserves their fundamental ideas. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-47 The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were to teach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strength and establishment in all their religious exercises. Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.</body></html>
