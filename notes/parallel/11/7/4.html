Josephus explains, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">windows in three divisions</span>, but this is no explanation of the words "light against light," etc. Fergusson understands the three outlooks to mean, first, the clerestory windows (that there was a clerestory he infers from Josephus Ant., 7:05.2), who describes this palace as "in the Corinthian manner," which cannot mean, he says, "the Corinthian order, which was not then invented, but after the fashion of a Corinthian <span class="accented">oecus</span>, which was a hall with a clerestory"); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a range of openings under the cornice of the walls; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a range of open doorways. But all this is conjecture. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-12 All Solomon's buildings, though beautiful, were intended for use. Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then his other buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laid in early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact, but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's. We ought to prefer God's honour before our own ease and satisfaction.</body></html>
