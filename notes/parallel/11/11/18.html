for we should have expected the starting-point of the flight to have been described in Edom itself. If the reading of the text is correct, the reference must be either to some branch of the Midianitish tribes settled between Edom and the desert of Paran, or to a city Midian, not far from the Gulf of Elath, of which some ancient authorities speak, and to which the LXX. expressly refers here.<p><span class= "bld">Paran</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-21.htm" title="And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.">Genesis 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-12.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.">Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm" title="And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.">Numbers 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-3.htm" title="And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.">Numbers 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm" title="And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.">Numbers 13:26</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm" title="And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.">1Samuel 25:1</a>) is part of the Sinaitic region, adjacent to the wilderness of Zin, and north of the range now called the <span class= "ital">El-Tih</span> mountains. It lies to the west of the Edomite territory, and was then evidently inhabited by an independent race, from which the fugitive companions of Hadad enlisted support.<p><span class= "bld">Pharaoh king of Egypt.</span>--The dynasty then reigning in Lower Egypt is that called the twenty-first, or Tanite, dynasty. Chronological considerations, and perhaps internal probabilities, suggest that this Pharaoh was not the same as the king who became father-in-law to Solomon. But the same policy of alliance with the occupants of Palestine and the neighbourhood is equally exemplified in both cases, though by different methods; and accords well with the apparent decadence of Egyptian power at this time, of which very little record is preserved in the monuments. Jealousy of the growing power of Israel under David and Solomon might prompt this favourable reception of Hadad, as afterwards of Jeroboam. The marriage of Solomon with the daughter of Pharaoh, and the active co-operation of Pharaoh against Gezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm" title="For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelled in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.">1Kings 9:16</a>), indicate an intervening variation of policy, without, however, any change in the general design of securing Egypt by alliances on the north-east. In this case the intermarriage of Hadad with the royal house, and the inclusion of his son Genubath among the children of Pharaoh, argue an unusual distinction, which could only have been due to a high estimate of the importance of influence over the strong country of Edom, and of the future chances of Hadad's recovery of the throne.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they arose out of Midian</span> [a name of wide and somewhat varied significance. Midian embraces the eastern portion of the peninsula of Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>), and stretches along the eastern border of Palestine. The term has been compared with our "Arabia." And the indefiniteness arises in both instances from the same cause, viz., that the country was almost entirely <span class="accented">desert</span>.
