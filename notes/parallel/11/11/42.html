(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-11.htm" title="And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.">1Kings 2:11</a>.) The coincidence is curious; but the accurate historical character of the whole narrative forbids the idea that the numbers given are merely round numbers, signifying long duration. Josephus gives eighty years--either by error in his Hebrew text, or perhaps by confusing together the duration of the two reigns.<p><span class= "bld">NOTE.</span>--The insertion in the LXX. version, found in the Vatican MS. after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-24.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They listened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.">1Kings 12:24</a>, runs as follows :--<p>"And there was a man of Mount Ephraim, a servant of Solomon, and his name was Jeroboam; and his mother's name was Sarira, a woman who was a harlot. And Solomon made him taskmaster [literally, "master of the staff," or "scourge"] over the burdens [forced labours] of the house of Joseph; and he built for Solomon Sarira, which is in Mount Ephraim; and he had three hundred chariots. He it was who built the citadel [the "Millo"], by the labours of the house of Ephraim, and completed the fortification of the city of David. And he was exalting himself to seek the kingdom. And Solomon sought to put him to death; so he feared, and stole away to Sousakim [Shishak], king of Egypt, and was with him till the death of Solomon. And Jeroboam heard in Egypt that Solomon was dead, and he spake in the ears of Sousakim, king of Egypt, saying, Send me away, and I will go back to my own land. And Sousakim said to him, Ask of me a request, and I will give it thee. And he gave to Jeroboam Ano, the elder sister of his own wife Thekemina [Tahpenes] to be his wife. She was great among the daughters of the king, and bare to Jeroboam Abias [Abijah] his son. And Jeroboam said to Sousakim, Send me really away, and I will go back. And Jeroboam went forth from Egypt, and came to the land of Sarira, in Mount Ephraim, and there gathered together to him the whole strength of Ephraim. And Jeroboam built there a fortress."<p>Then follows, with variations of detail, the story of the sickness of Abijah, the visit of Jeroboam's wife to Ahijah, and the message of judgment; corresponding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/14-1.htm" title="At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.">1Kings 14:1-18</a>. The narrative then continues thus:--<p>" And Jeroboam went his way to Shechem, in Mount Ephraim, and gathered together there the tribes of Israel; and Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, went up there. And the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, the Enlamite, saying. Take to thyself a new garment, which has never been in water, and tear it in ten pieces; and thou shalt give them to Jeroboam, and shalt say to him, Take thee ten pieces, to clothe thyself therewith. And Jeroboam took them; and Shemaiah said, These things saith the Lord, signifying the ten tribes of Israel."<p>The whole concludes with an account, given with some characteristic variations, of the remonstrance with Rehoboam, the rebellion, and the prohibition by Shemaiah of the intended attack of Rehoboam, corresponding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/12-1.htm" title="And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.">1Kings 12:1-24</a>.<p>This half-independent version of the history is interesting, but obviously far inferior in authority to the Hebrew text. The incidents fit less naturally into each other; the warning of Ahijah as to the destruction of the house of Jeroboam is obviously out of place; and by the ascription to Shemaiah of the prophecy of Jeroboam's royalty, the striking coincidence of the authorship of the two predictions of prosperity and disaster is lost. The record of Shishak's intercourse with Jeroboam is apparently imitated from the history of Hadad at the court of the earlier Pharaoh; and the circumstances of Jeroboam's assumption of royal pretensions are improbable. Josephus, moreover, ignores this version of the story altogether; nor is it found in any other version. Its origin is unknown, and its growth curious enough. But it does not seem to throw much fresh light on the history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the time</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">days</span>] that <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> [Josephus, here as elsewhere, doubles the figure, making his reign to have lasted <span class="accented">eighty</span> years. It is somewhat remarkable, but affords no just ground for suspicion, that each of the first three kings of Israel should have reigned just forty years. "Such numerical coincidences occur in exact history. Saosduchinus, Chiniladanus, and Nabopolassar, three consecutive kings of Babylon, reigned each twenty-one years" (Rawlinson).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:41-43 Solomon's reign was as long as his father's, but his life was not so. Sin shortened his days. If the world, with all its advantages, could satisfy the soul, and afford real joy, Solomon would have found it so. But he was disappointed in all, and to warn us, has left this record of all earthly enjoyments, Vanity and vexation of spirit. The New Testament declares that one greater than Solomon is come to reign over us, and to possess the throne of his father David. May we not see something of Christ's excellency faintly represented to us in this figure?</body></html>
