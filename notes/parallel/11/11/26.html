As the great rebel against the House of David, the leader of the revolution which divided Israel and destroyed its greatness, the introducer of the idolatry of the temples of Dan and Bethel, and the corrupter of the worship of Jehovah in deference to an astute worldly policy, he stands out in a vividness of portraiture unapproached, till we come to the history of Ahab at the close of the book.<p><span class= "bld">An Ephrathite of Zereda.</span>--The word "Ephrathite," which mostly means an inhabitant of Ephrata or Bethlehem, is here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1Samuel 1:1</a>) simply another form of the name Ephraimite.

The Vatican MS. of the LXX., by a slight change in the Hebrew, reads <span class= "ital">Sarira</span>, which is probably a rendering of <span class= "ital">Zererah</span> or <span class= "ital">Zererath</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm" title="And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.">Judges 7:22</a>), and, in the additional record noticed above, makes it a strong fortified place in Mount Ephraim.<p><span class= "bld">The son of a widow woman.</span>--This phrase, added to the phrase "Solomon's servant," is evidently designed to mark the utterly dependent condition from which Solomon's favour raised the future rebel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam</span> [Viewed in the light of their history, the names <span class="accented">Jeroboam</span> and <span class="accented">Rehoboam are</span> both instructive.

That this place was apparently situate in the tribe of Manasseh, is no argument against the identification (Bahr), for an Ephrathite might surely be born out of Ephraim.

Had not he taught others, that whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand? Yet he himself thinks to defeat that counsel.
