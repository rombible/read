from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.">1Chronicles 18:11-13</a>, and Psalms 60 (title and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-8.htm" title="And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.">1Kings 11:8</a>). It is there closely connected with the great struggle with the Syrians, and the victory is ascribed in one record to Joab, in the other to Abishai. Here David himself is described as taking part in the war--perhaps completing the conquest, as in the war with Ammon, after it had been successfully begun by Joab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/12-26.htm" title="And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.">2Samuel 12:26-31</a>). (Instead of "David was in Edom," the LXX. and other versions read "David destroyed Edom," by a slight variation of the Hebrew text.) The war was evidently one of ruthless extermination of "every male," except those who fled the country, or found refuge in its rocky fastnesses, and was carried on by systematic ravage under the command of Joab. How it was provoked we do not know; for we have no previous notice of Edom since the time of the Exodus, except a reference to war against it in the days of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1Samuel 14:47</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it came to pass, when David was in Edom</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>. But the text is peculiar. Instead of "in Edom" we have "with Edom," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span>, unless we take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> to be the mark of the accusative, which, however, there is no verb to govern. Keil interprets, "When David had to do with Edom." Bahr refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>, but they are not strictly parallel, and it is possible that the text is slightly corrupt, as the LXX., Syr., and Arab. must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> before them "when David <span class="accented">smote</span> Edom." The LXX., <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., reads <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> It was only vicariously, however, that David <span class="accented">smote</span> Edom, or was in Edom. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>, <span class="accented">Abishai</span> slew 18,000 Edomites, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>. (title) represents <span class="accented">Joab</span> as having slain 12,000 at the same time and place. The two brothers were both in high command, or Abishal may have been detailed by Joab to this service], <span class="cmt_word">and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain</span> [The commentators generally are agreed that these are the Israelites slain by the Edomites during an invasion of Israel, and not either the Edomites or Israelites slain in the valley of Salt], <span class="cmt_word">after he had smitten</span> [rather, that <span class="accented">he smote</span>. This is the apodosis] <span class="cmt_word">every male in Edom.</span> [This is, of course, hyperbolical (cf. "all Israel" below). It is clear that the whole Edomite nation did not perish. The words point to a terrible slaughter (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-13.htm">1 Chronicles 18:13</a>) among the men of war. Possibly the cruelties of the Edomites (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>) had provoked this act of retribution, as to which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:14-25 While Solomon kept close to God and to his duty, there was no enemy to give him uneasiness; but here we have an account of two. If against us, he can make us fear even the least, and the very grasshopper shall be a burden. Though they were moved by principles of ambition or revenge, God used them to correct Solomon.</body></html>
