They are, no doubt, referred to in this place in connection with the prophecy just recorded, and the notice of Jeroboam's earlier career which it suggests. But it is implied in the case of Hadad, as it is expressly declared in the case of Rezon, that their resistance continued through all Solomon's reign. They were not, therefore, crushed, even in the days of his greatness, although then probably reduced to practical insignificance; they seem to have become formidable again during his declining years.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">Hadad the Edomite.</span>--The name (or rather, title) <span class= "ital">Hadad</span> (with the kindred names <span class= "ital">Hadar, Hadadezer</span> or <span class= "ital">Hadarezer</span>, and <span class= "ital">Benhadad</span>) is most frequently found as a designation of the kings of Syria. Here, however, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-35.htm" title="And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.">Genesis 36:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-46.htm" title="And when Husham was dead, Hadad the son of Bedad, which smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.">1Chronicles 1:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-50.htm" title="And when Baalhanan was dead, Hadad reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pai; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.">1Chronicles 1:50</a>, it is given to members of the royal family of Edom. According to ancient authorities, it is a Syriac title of the sun--in this respect like the more celebrated title <span class= "ital">Pharaoh</span>--assumed by the king, either as indicating descent from the sun-god, or simply as an appellation of splendour and majesty. The Hadad here mentioned seems to have been the last scion of the royal house, escaping alone, as a child, from the slaughter of his kindred and people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad</span> [in ver. 17 written Adad, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>.
