(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-14.htm" title="In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.">Esther 2:14</a>.) Nor does the statement here made necessarily imply that at any one time the whole number existed. Still, the numbers here given, though found also in the LXX. and in Josephus, are not only extraordinarily large, but excessive in comparison with the "three- score queens and fourscore concubines" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-8.htm" title="There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>, and disproportionate in the relative number of the superior and inferior wives. It is possible that, in relation to the former, at any rate, the text may be corrupt, though the corruption must be of ancient date.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses</span> [These may have been members of royal or princely houses of neighbouring nations. Evidently they enjoyed a distinguished rank], <span class="cmt_word">and three hundred concubines</span> [Though not committed to a defence of the accuracy of the figures 700 and 300 (which are clearly <span class="accented">round</span> numbers), it must be said that the reasons alleged for reducing them (as from 700 to 70) are not of much weight. It is hardly correct, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, to say (as Rawlinson) that the numbers are given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a> as "threescore queens and fourscore concubines," for it is obvious that too much importance must not be attached to an <span class="accented">obiter</span> statement ("there are threescore," etc.) in a poetical book, too, and one descriptive of Solomon's youth. The view of Ewald and Keil, again, that these numbers represent the sum total of the inmates of the harem at different periods of Solomon's long reign, rather than the number present at any one time - they would see in the numbers of Song of Solomon <span class="accented">l.c</span>. a statement of the <span class="accented">average strength</span> of the seraglio - though not to be described as evasive, is certainly not the natural interpretation of the words. And these numbers, when we compare them with the establishments of other Eastern potentates, are not found to be at all incredible. The commentators all remind us that Dareius Codomannus, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, took with him on his expedition against Alexander 360 <span class="accented">pellices</span>. Or if ancient history, as Rawlinson affirms, furnishes no strict parallel to these figures, the harems of modern Persia and Turkey at any rate have quite equalled that of Solomon. (See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) It is true that Rehoboam had only 18 wives and 60 concubines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>), but then Rehoboam was not Solomon. If his harem was but a tithe of his father's, so also were his wealth and his power]: <span class="cmt_word">and his wives turned away his heart.</span> ["Satan hath found this bait to take so well that he never changed since he crept into Paradise" (Bp. Hall).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-8 There is not a more melancholy and astonishing instance of human depravity in the sacred Scriptures, than that here recorded. Solomon became a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degrees gave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom. Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the traitors in our own hearts.</body></html>
