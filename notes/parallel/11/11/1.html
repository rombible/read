Polygamy is also attributed to David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-2.htm" title="And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;">2Samuel 3:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-16.htm" title="And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.">2Samuel 15:16</a>), marking perhaps the characteristic temperament of voluptuousness, which seduced him into his great sin; but it was carried out by Solomon on a scale corresponding to the magnificence of his kingdom, and probably had in his case the political object of alliance with neighbouring or tributary kings. We find it inherited by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/11-18.htm" title="And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;">2Chronicles 11:18-21</a>), and it probably became in different degrees the practice of succeeding kings. Hitherto, while polygamy, as everywhere in the East, had to some degree existed in Israel from patriarchal times, yet it must have been checked by the marriage regulations of the Law. Nor had there yet been the royal magnificence and wealth, under which alone it attains to full development. We have some traces of it in the households of some of the Judges: Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-30.htm" title="And Gideon had three score and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.">Judges 8:30</a>), Jair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>), Ibzan and Abdon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-9.htm" title="And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.">Judges 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>). Now, however, it became, in spite of the prohibition of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm" title="Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), a recognised element of royal self-indulgence--such as is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm" title="I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:">Ecclesiastes 2:7-8</a>, and is perhaps traceable even through the beauty of the Song of Solomon. In itself, even without any incidental consequences, it must necessarily be a demoralising power, as sinning against the primeval ordinance of God, and robbing natural relations of their true purity and sacredness. But in actual fact it sinned still more by involving forbidden marriages with idolatrous races, with the often-predicted effect of declension into idolatry.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, Hittites.</span>--The first three of these races were kindred to Israel and of the stock of Abraham, and were now among the subjects of Solomon; the last two were of the old Canaanitish stock, and were now inferior allies. To the last alone properly attached the prohibition of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-12.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:">Exodus 34:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/7-3.htm" title="Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take to your son.">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>); but the reason on which that prohibition was grounded was now equally applicable to the others; for they also had fallen into the worship of false gods. Hence the extension of it to them, recognised by the Jews after the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/9-11.htm" title="Which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.">Ezra 9:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:">Nehemiah 13:23-29</a>).<p>It is to be noted that the marriage with the daughter of Pharaoh is apparently distinguished from these connections, which are so greatly censured, and that there is no mention of the introduction of any Egyptian idolatry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And</span>.

As he exceeded other kings in glory, wisdom, and power, so must he excel them not only in armies, chariots, and horses, but also in the number of his wives. It is clear, therefore, that the "lust of the eye" and "the pride of life" had their part in this huge establishment.

If the Ammonite or Moabite was not to be received into the congregation until the <span class="accented">tenth</span> generation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>); if the Israelite was not to seek their peace or prosperity all the days of his life (ver. 6), then the idea of intermarriage with them must have been altogether repugnant to the Hebrew polity, as indeed we may gather from the book of Ruth], <span class="cmt_word">Edomites</span> [Favourably distinguished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>) from the two preceding races.

But such tradition was sure to arise; the uxorious character of Solomon and his close relations with Hiram are quite sufficient to account for its growth.

Solomon became a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degrees gave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom. Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the traitors in our own hearts.</body></html>
