The kingdom of Zobah was evidently a powerful state at that time, at war with the Syrian kingdom of Hamath, but holding supremacy over the Syrians of Damascus, and the "Syrians beyond the river" Euphrates; and (as the record shows) accumulating vast treasures of gold, silver, and brass. The establishment of Rezon (and Hadad?) at Damascus must have taken place later; for at the time we find that David "put governors in Damascus," and reduced its inhabitants to a tributary condition. Possibly there may have been some rising early in the reign of Solomon; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-3.htm" title="And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.">2Chronicles 8:3</a>, we find that Solomon had to "go up against Hamath-zobah," with which expedition the foundation of Tadmor seems to be connected. But it is probable that the establishment of an independent power in Damaseus dated only from the later days of Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band</span> [either of rebels before or of fugitives after the defeat], <span class="cmt_word">when David slew them of Zobah</span> [<span class="accented">Of Zobah</span>, not in Hebrews "Them" must mean the Syrian army]: <span class="cmt_word">and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein</span> [As David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>), this must have been some time <span class="accented">after</span> the defeat of the Syrians. But Keil argues that it cannot have been in the middle or later part of Solomon's reign, inasmuch as Solomon must have been lord of Damascus, or he could not have built Palmyra. But it is not so incontrovertibly settled that Solomon did build Palmyra (see on 1 Kings 9:18) as to make this argument of much weight. And even if it were, we might still fix the reign of Rezon at an earlier period of Solomon's sway.

The word "reigned," however (plural), is somewhat remarkable. It may perhaps be accounted for by the plurals which precede it. The insertion of one "yod" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5d5;</span>) gives the sense "<span class="accented">they</span> <span class="accented">made him king</span>," which would certainly be preferable, if the emendation were not purely conjectural. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:14-25 While Solomon kept close to God and to his duty, there was no enemy to give him uneasiness; but here we have an account of two.
