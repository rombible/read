The courteous evasion by the Pharaoh of that time of Hadad's request for permission to return, may probably indicate the beginning of the change of attitude towards the powerful monarchy of Israel, which took effect in the subsequent close alliance of the kingdoms. As the text stands, the record here stops abruptly, and then recurs to Hadad by a curious allusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm" title="And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.">1Kings 11:25</a>. It can hardly be doubted that there is some omission or dislocation of the text. The LXX. (in the Vatican MS.) introduces after the words "Hadad the Edomite" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1Kings 11:14</a>, the words "and Rezon the son of Eliadah . . . all the days of Solomon" from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1Kings 11:23-25</a>; and then, resuming the story of Hadad, adds, after the record of his request to Pharaoh, "and Hadad returned to his land. This is the mischief which Hadad did, and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over <span class= "ital">Edom</span>." Josephus, on the other hand, says that at the time of the original request, Pharaoh refused permission; but that in the declining years of Solomon it was granted, and that Hadad, finding it impossible to excite rebellion in Edom, which was strongly garrisoned, joined Rezon in Syria, and with him established an independent power, and did mischief to Israel. (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 6, 6.) This account is itself probable enough; it accounts, moreover, for the close connection in the history (especially in the LXX. reading) between Hadad and Rezon, and for the insertion of the whole matter in this place; and accords also with the fact that, while Syria seems at once to become independent after the death of Solomon, we hear of no revolt of Edom till the time of Jelioshaphat (2 Chronicles 20).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead</span> [It comes out very significantly here what a name of terror Joab's had been in Edom and how deep was the impression which his bloody vengeance of a quarter of a century before had made] <span class="cmt_word">Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">send me away</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> that I may go to mine own country.</span> [Rawlinson cites Herod. 3:132-137; 5:25, 35, 106, 107, to show that refugees at Oriental courts must obtain permission to leave them.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:14-25 While Solomon kept close to God and to his duty, there was no enemy to give him uneasiness; but here we have an account of two.
