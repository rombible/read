It is uncertain whether there were one or more rows of cherubim and palms. Keil, arguing from the analogy of Egyptian temples, contends for two or three rows, but it is doubtful how far the Israelites, notwithstanding their new and intimate relations with the country, would take Egypt and its idolatrous shrines for a model. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> tends to show that the palm trees alternated with the cherubs. The cherubim may have had two faces, such as he describes (ver. 19), the face of a man on the one side, and the face of a young lion on the other side; but if so, they must have differed in form from those of the oracle. Possibly the open flowers formed a border, or were sculptured in festoons, above, and the gourds (or buds) formed a border below (as in the Kouyunjik slab). But as to this the text is silent. But while we are ignorant of the precise form and of the arrangement of these ornamental carvings, we are not wholly in the dark as to their symbolism. For everything in the temple, we may be sure, had a meaning. Let us inquire, then, into the significance of the cherubim, the palms and the flowers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">The Cherubim</span> have been regarded by some as symbols of the invisible Godhead, by others as "representations of the heavenly spirits which surround the Lord of glory and set forth psychical life at its highest stage" (Keil); but it seems best to view them as symbols of all animal life, including the highest and perhaps not excluding the thought of Him who is the source and spring of life, the <span class="accented">Anima animantium</span> (cf. ch. 12:28). Hence they are spoken of as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5, 13, 15</a>, etc.) "the living things" (compare <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6, 8, 9</a>), and even as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> "the life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-14.htm">Ezekiel 10:14, 15</a>, etc.) The cherubim consequently speak of the great animal kingdom before its Creator. "Creaturely being reaches its highest degree in those which have an <span class="accented">anima</span>, and among these, the lion, the bull, the eagle, and the man are the highest and most complete" (Bahr). These shapes, accordingly, were not inappropriate or unmeaning in a temple raised by the creature to the glory of the Creator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Just as the cherubim speak of animal, so do the <span class="accented">Palms</span> of vegetable life. They are "the princes of the vegetable kingdom" (Linnaeus) "Amongst trees there is none so lofty and towering, none which has such a fair majestic growth, which is so evergreen, and which affords so grateful a shade and such noble fruits - fruits which are said to be the food of the blessed in paradise - as the palm" (Bahr), who also adds that it is said to have as many excellent properties as there are days in the year, and cites Humboldt as designating it the "noblest of plants forms to which the nations have always accorded the meed of beauty." Judaea, he further remarks, is the fatherland of the palm, so much so that the palm in later days became the symbol of Palestine (as on the well known coin with the legend <span class="accented">Judaea capta</span>). The palms, therefore, tell of the vegetable world, and of Him who fashioned its noble and graceful forms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> And very similar was the testimony of the <span class="accented">Flowers.</span> "Flowers and bloom have been, from ancient times to our own, the usual symbols of lifefulness .... So then by the flower work, as well as by the cherubim and the palm trees, was the dwelling of Jehovah, which was adorned therewith, designated as an <span class="accented">abode of life"</span> (Bahr). On the earthly dwelling place of the Eternal, that is to say, were everywhere pourtrayed the various tokens of His Almighty power and goodness. And the significance of each is the same. "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created." They were graved] <span class="cmt_word">within and without.</span> [These words, here and in ver. 30, are generally taken to mean "in the oracle and in the house." But it is worthy of consideration whether they do not rather signify, "in the house and in the porch." The latter was overlaid with gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>). It is doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">on the outside</span>, can be applied to any part of the interior, and here its application would be to the <span class="accented">oracle</span> (Thenius)]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:15-38 See what was typified by this temple. 1. Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.</body></html>
