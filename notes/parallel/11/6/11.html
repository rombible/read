Unlike this latter, it is one of simple promise of blessing, with no note of warning. But it is to be observed that, in accordance with the general principle laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/18-5.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Jeremiah 18:5-10</a>, the promise--repeating the promises already made to David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,">2Samuel 7:10-15</a>, and to Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a>, but with special application to the newly-built Temple--is made strictly conditional on obedience. In its main points, indeed, as working out the great covenant with Abraham for the blessing of all families of the earth, it was to be in any case fulfilled. But for each generation the enjoyment of the blessings promised was contingent on faith and obedience, and for the whole nation it was from time to time forfeited, until the final destruction of Israel as a nation. Yet even now, St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-29.htm" title="For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.">Romans 11:29</a>) teaches that for Israel there is still some hope of the ancient promise of blessing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the word of the Lord came to Solomon</span> [probably through the prophet Nathan.
