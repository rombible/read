But the idea implied in this prohibition was rather different--viz., the use for the altar of stones in their simple, matural condition, without "pollution" by the art of man. It has been chronicled in Heber's well-known lines:--<p>"No workmen's steel, no ponderous axes rung;<p>Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprung."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">perfect.</span> This does not mean <span class="accented">unhewn</span>, though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> is undoubtedly used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-6.htm">Deuteronomy 27:6</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>) of unhewn or virgin stone; and Gesenius would so understand the expression here, But the context seems rather to convey the idea that the stones were not shaped <span class="accented">on the spot</span>. It was apparently the belief of the ancients that stones of proper shape and size were provided in their bed by God (so Theodoret and Procopius,) It is inconceivable, however, that no dressing or preparation of any kind would be required; an idea, moreover, which is contradicted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a>. When Gardiner (in Bahr, American edition) quotes Keil (in his earlier work) as understanding "all unviolated stones of the quarry," he hardly does justice to that author, who straightway adds, "that is, not altogether unhewn stones... but stones that were so hewn and wrought in the quarry that neither hammer," etc. (see below). Similarly Thehius and Bahr] <span class="cmt_word">before it was brought thither</span> [so the Authorized Version renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> but mistakenly. It means, the quarry (Gesenius, Keil. For the construction, see Ewald, 289<span class="accented">a</span>, and Gesenius, Gram. ed. Rodiger, p. 170.) The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used of quarrying in 1 Kings 5:31 (Heb.) <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Where was this quarry? The general idea is that it was in the Lebanon. And it is not to be denied that some of the massive substructions and cornerstones of the temple may have been brought from the mountain, along with the wood; but the bulk of the stone, there can be no doubt, was found much nearer home. Some of it, according to the Mishna (<span class="accented">Middoth</span>, 3:4), came from Bethlehem; but we can hardly be mistaken in believing that for the most part it was quarried in Jerusalem itself, under the very temple rock, and out of the vast caverns recovered some years ago by Dr. Barclay (see his "City of the Great King"), the "Royal Caverns" of Josephus. See "Quart. Journal," Pal. Explor. Fund (No. 7.), pp, 373, 374, and cf. p. 34. There are unmistakable evidences of these extensive caverns having served as a quarry. Not only are the walls cut straight, but rude masses are left here and there to support the roof, and, what is still more convincing, there are stones more or less cut out of the rock, and incisions are made where stones are to be quarried. There was no reason why the workmen should go far afield for stone when they had it, and of very excellent quality, at their own doors]: <span class="cmt_word">so that there was neither hammer</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and hammers.</span> Keil understands "finished stones of the quarry, and hammer, and axe." But the word "was built" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), coming as <span class="cmt_word">it</span> does between "quarry" and "hammers," almost forbids this connexion] nor axe [Heb. <span class="accented">the axe</span>] <span class="cmt_word">nor any tool</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">every tool</span>] <span class="cmt_word">of iron heard in the house, while it was building.</span> [The historian remarks on this, not only because it was so unusual, but with the evident idea that it was a fulfilment of the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5, 6</a>), which required the <span class="accented">altar</span> to be of virgin stones, untouched by tool of iron. If the quarries are to be identified with the "Royal Caverns," it is easy to understand how the temple rose up in silence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The temple is called the house of the Lord, because it was directed and modelled by him, and was to be employed in his service. This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never further the work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows up in silence, Mr 5:27.</body></html>
