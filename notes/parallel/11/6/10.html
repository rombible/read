The word (masculine) is here again used of the entire side structure] <span class="cmt_word">against all the house, five cubits high</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, each story was five cubits (7.5 feet). The three stories would altogether measure fifteen cubits, and of course something must be allowed for joists, floors, etc. The entire height of the side structure (exterior) would consequently be about 18 or 20 cubits. And as the house was internally 30 cubits high, the exterior measurement would probably be about 32 cubits. It has hence been inferred that between the side structure and the top of temple wall there would be a clear space of 12 or 14 cubits, in which the windows were inserted. But this is based on the assumption that the side structure had a <span class="accented">flat</span> roof, which is by no means certain. If the roof leaned against the walls of the house, with a low pitch, there would still be space amply sufficient for the clerestory windows. Rawlinson's diagram (p. 511), which gives 80 cubits as the height from basement to <span class="accented">ridge of roof</span>, and only allows 20 cubits for height of walls, practically makes the house 20 instead of 30 cubits high, for it is hardly likely that it had an open roof. In fact, we know that it had a cieling (ver. 14), which must have been at the height of 30 cubits (see the diagrams on p. 102. In <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> house and side structure are represented with flat, in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with ridged or sloping roofs), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>unless there was an upper chamber above the house, as to which see ver. 20. Rawlinson's diagram has this further defect, that he allows nothing for thickness of joists, floors, and cielings. If we allow one cubit for each floor, then, on his plan, there would be little or no room left for the windows. This verse is hardly to be considered as a repetition of ver. 5, the side structure being here mentioned in connexion with its height and the materials used in its construction] <span class="cmt_word">and they rested on</span> [the meaning of the Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d6;</span> has been much disputed. It is uncertain what is the nominative, Solomon (as in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>), or the "floor" (just referred to in <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>). Gesenius understands the former, and renders, "<span class="accented">he</span> covered the house," etc. Thenius, "<span class="accented">he</span> fastened the floor," etc. Keil adopts the latter alternative, "it held to the house with cedar beams." It may be urged against this rendering (as also against Thenius's) that beams which merely <span class="accented">rested</span> on the walls would hardly <span class="accented">bind</span> or <span class="accented">hold</span> the side structure to the main building. But it is almost impossible to decide between these interpretations. We may either render "he covered," etc. (with Chald., Vulg.) in which case ver. 10 would agree with ver. 9 (each, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, would refer to the roofing; ver. 9 to roof of temple; ver. 10 to roof of side structure and its stories); or we may take the words to mean "it laid hold of, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, rested on] <span class="cmt_word">the house with timber of cedar.</span> At this point the historian interrupts his description of the building to record the gracious promise made to the king during its erection. It should, perhaps, be stated that this (vers. 11-14) is omitted in the Vat. LXX. But it has every mark of genuineness.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The temple is called the house of the Lord, because it was directed and modelled by him, and was to be employed in his service. This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never further the work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows up in silence, Mr 5:27.</body></html>
