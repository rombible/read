In the LXX., 440 is read for 480, possibly by an interchange of two similar Hebrew letters, or, perhaps, by reckoning from the completion of Exodus at the death of Moses instead of its beginning. The Vulgate agrees with the Hebrew text. Josephus, on the other hand, without any hint of any other reckoning in the Scriptural record, gives 592 years. The date itself, involving some apparent chronological difficulties, has been supposed to be an interpolation; but without any sufficient ground, except Josephus's seeming ignorance of its existence, and some early quotations of the passage by Origen and others without it; and in neglect of the important fact that, disagreeing <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>with earlier chronological indications in Scripture, it is infinitely unlikely to have been thus interpolated by any mere scribe.<p>These indications are, however, vague. The period includes the conquest and rule of Joshua, the era of the Judges down to Samuel, the reigns of Saul and David, and the three years of Solomon's reign already elapsed. Now, of these divisions, only the last three can be ascertained with any definiteness, at about 83 years. The time occupied by the conquest and rule of Joshua, cannot be gathered with any certainty from Scripture. The same is the case with the duration of some of the subsequent Judgeships. Even the numerous chronological notices given in the Book of Judges are inconclusive. We cannot tell whether they are literally accurate, or, as the recurrence of round numbers may seem to suggest, indefinite expressions for long periods; nor can we determine how far the various Judgeships were contemporaneous or successive. The tradition followed by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-19.htm" title="And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.">Acts 13:19-21</a>), assigning to the whole a period of 450 years, agrees generally with the latter idea. The genealogies given (as, for example, of David, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ruth/4-18.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,">Ruth 4:18-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/2-3.htm" title="The sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah: which three were born to him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess. And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the LORD; and he slew him.">1Chronicles 2:3-15</a>, and elsewhere) agree with the former. Hence, these vague chronological statistics cannot constitute <span class= "bld">a </span>sufficient ground for setting aside a date so formally and unhesitatingly given at an important epoch of the history, corresponding to the equally formal determination of the date of the Exodus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40-41</a>. The omission of the date in quotations, again, proves little. The different date given by Josephus, without any notice of that which we now have, presents the only real difficulty. But it is possible that he may have been inclined tacitly to harmonise his chronology with some other reckoning known in his time among the heathen; and in any case it is doubtful whether his authority can outweigh that of our present text and the ancient versions. On the whole, therefore, the grounds assigned for rejection of the chronological notice of this verse, are insufficient.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt</span> [This date has been the subject of much controversy, which cannot even now be considered (<span class="accented">pace</span> Keil: "The correctness of the number 480 is now pretty generally admitted") as closed. Grave doubts are entertained as to its genuineness. Lord A. Hervey (Dict. Bib. vol. 2. p. 22) says it is "manifestly erroneous." Rawlinson considers it to be "an interpolation into the sacred text" (p. 515). And it is to he observed, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> that the LXX. reads 440 instead of 480 years - a discrepancy which is suspicious, and argues some amount of incertitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Origen quotes this verse without these words (Comm. in S. Johann 2:20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> They would seem to have been unknown to Josephus, Clem. Alex., and others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> It is not the <span class="accented">manner</span> of Old Testament writers thus to date events from an era, an idea which appears to have first occurred to the Greeks <span class="accented">temp.</span> Thucydides (Rawlinson). It is admitted that we have no other instance in the Old Testament where this is done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> It is difficult to reconcile this statement with other chronological notices both of the Old and New Testaments. For taking the numbers which we find in the Hebrew text of the books which refer to this period, they sum up to considerably more than 480 years. The time of the Judges alone comprises 410 years at the least. It should be stated, however, with regard to the <span class="accented">chronology</span> of the period last mentioned <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it only pretends to furnish round numbers - 20, 40, and the like - and evidently does not aim at exactitude; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there is good ground for suspecting that the periods are not always consecutive; that in some cases, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they overlap. We are not justified, therefore, because of the dates of the Judges in rejecting this statement. The question of New Testament chronology is somewhat more complicated. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-20.htm">Acts 13:20</a>, St. Paul states the period between the division of Canaan, by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1, 2</a>), and the time of Samuel the prophet as 450 years (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>) But Lachmann, on the authority <span class="accented">of</span> A, B, C (and we may add <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>), considers the received text to be corrupt, and would place <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> Alford, however, treats this reading as "an attempt at correcting the difficult chronology of the verse," and says that "all attempts to reconcile" it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> "are arbitrary and forced." If, then, the received text is to stand - and it is to be noticed that the reigns of the Judges, including Samuel, sum up exactly to the period mentioned by St. Paul, 450 years - the interval between the Exodus and the erection of the temple cannot well have been less than 99 or 100 years longer, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, 580 - Josephus makes it 592 - instead of 480 years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The chronology of Josephus - to which by itself, perhaps, no great weight is to be attached, agrees with St. Paul's estimate, and of course contradicts that of the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> Nor does it seem to be a valid argument for the retention of the suspected words, that "the precision of the statement is a voucher for its accuracy." (Bahr, who adds, "Not only is the whole number of the years given, but also the year of the reign of the king, and even the month itself," for the genuineness of the later date, "<span class="accented">In the fourth year,"</span> etc., is not questioned.) The remark of Keil that the building of the temple marked a new and important epoch in the history of the chosen people, and so justified an exceptional reference to the birth or emancipation of the nation, though undoubtedly true, will hardly avail much against the considerations alleged above. On the whole, therefore, I confess to the belief that these words are the interpolation of a later hand (of which we shall find traces elsewhere), though it would, perhaps, be premature, with only the evidence now before us, to exclude them from the text. It is certainly noteworthy that such destructive critics as Ewald and Thenius are satisfied as to their genuineness], <span class="cmt_word">in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel</span> [according to the chronology of Ussher, this was A.M. 3000], <span class="cmt_word">in the month Zif</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, May. The word signifies <span class="accented">splendour</span>. The month was probably so called because of the brilliancy of its flowers (Gesen., Keil, al.)], <span class="cmt_word">which is the second month</span> [This explanation is added because before the captivity the months (with the exception of <span class="accented">Abib</span>) appear to have had no regular names, but were almost always designated by numbers. (See, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>). Only four pre-captivity names are recorded, and of these three are mentioned in connexion with the building of the temple, viz., <span class="accented">Zif</span> here and in ver. 37, <span class="accented">Bul</span> in ver. 38, and <span class="accented">Ethanim</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>. It has hence been inferred that these names were not in general use, but were restricted to public documents, etc. (Dict. Bib. if. 416), a supposition which, if correct, would account for the facility with which the old appellations were superseded by post-captivity names. The later name for this month was <span class="accented">Iyar</span> (Targum on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">that he began</span> [not in Heb.] <span class="cmt_word">to build the house of</span> [Heb. to] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span>. [The chronicler mentions the site (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>), "In Mount Moriah ....in the threshing floor of Ornan," etc. We know from the extensive foundations yet remaining that the preparation of the platform on which the temple should stand must have been a work of considerable time and labour, and see Jos., Ant. 8:03.9, and Bell. Jud. 5:05.1. We can hardly be wrong in identifying the remarkable rock known as the <span class="accented">Sakrah</span>, over which the mosque of Omar (<span class="accented">Kubbet-es-Sakrah</span>) is built - the "pierced rock" of the Jerusalem Itinerary - with the threshing floor of Ornan. The reader will find an interesting paper on the site of the temple in "Scribner's Monthly," vol. 11. pp. 257-272. According to Mr. Beswick, whose measurements and conclusions it gives, the <span class="accented">porch</span> stood on the <span class="accented">Sakrah. Mr.</span> Conder, however, urges strong reasons ("Tent Work," pp. 187-9) for placing the <span class="accented">Holy of Holies</span> on the rock. We should then "see the Holy House in its natural and traditional position on the top of the mountain; we see the courts descending on either side, according to the present slopes of the hill; we find the great rock galleries dropping naturally into their right places; and finally, we see the temple, by the immutability of Oriental custom, still a temple, and the site of the great altar still consecrated [?] by the beautiful little chapel <span class="cmt_word">of</span> the chain." But see Porteri. p. 125; Pal. Explor. p. 4, also pp. 342, 343; "Our Work in Palestine," chs. 8. and 9; "Recovery of Jerusalem," ch. 12.<span class="accented">, etc. Quot viatores, tot sententiae.</span>] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The temple is called the house of the Lord, because it was directed and modelled by him, and was to be employed in his service. This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never further the work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows up in silence, Mr 5:27.</body></html>
