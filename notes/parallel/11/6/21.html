The LXX. and Vulg. have wholly different readings; but our translation appears to be substantially correct, and to signify either that Solomon made a chain-work decoration on the partition, or (perhaps more probably) that he made a golden chain to go across the entrance in the partition before the Oracle, in front of the veil, so as to be an additional guard against intrusion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And</span>. The ornamentation of the holy place is next mentioned] <span class="cmt_word">Solomon overlaid</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house</span> [as well as the oracle] <span class="cmt_word">within</span> <span class="cmt_word">with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle</span> [These words are extremely obscure. The prevailing view is that of Gesenius, <span class="accented">al.</span>, that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> = "he bolted," etc. But, if so, what did the chains bolt? Bahr says, the boards of the cedar partition, just as the bars fastened together the boards of the tabornacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-26.htm">Exodus 26:26-29</a>). Gesen. himself (together with Keil, marg., <span class="accented">al</span>.) understands the doors, "he bolted the doors of the oracle," so as to keep them closed, except on the day of atonement. But the literal rendering is, "he carried over with chains of gold before the oracle," where nothing is said of either boards or doors. The more natural interpretation, therefore, would perhaps be: he carried on the gold plates of the house in chains of gold across the partition, and so fastened it to the side walls. Perhaps this was done to avoid any fracture of, or insertion into, the stonework]; <span class="cmt_word">and he overlaid it</span> [What? Keil says, the cedar altar last mentioned at the end of ver. 20. But the altar has now dropped out of the reader's, and therefore presumably out of the writer's mind. It would be more natural to understand the words of the oracle just mentioned, but the adornment of the oracle has already been related (ver. 20), and it is hardly likely that having stated that it was covered with <span class="accented">pure gold</span> in one verse, he would mention that it was overlaid with <span class="accented">gold</span> in the next. It looks as if the cedar partition were referred to, the boards "before the oracle"] <span class="cmt_word">with gold.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:15-38 See what was typified by this temple. 1. Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.</body></html>
