Round three sides of the Temple was built a kind of aisle, opening, however, outwards and not into the Temple, having three storeys of low chambers (each only five cubits high), so arranged that the beams of their roofs were supported on rests on the outside of the wall (each rest being a cubit wide), leaving the wall itself intact. Thus <span class= "ital">the </span>chambers of the lowest storey were narrowest--five cubits broad; the second storey six cubits, and the highest storey seven cubits broad. The higher storeys (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-8.htm" title="The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.">1Kings 6:8</a>), in which the chambers no doubt opened into one another, were approached by a staircase, having an external entrance on the right side of the building; the chambers of the lowest storey probably had external doors of their own. Above the highest storey were still five cubits of wall, which would give room for the windows (like clerestory windows) previously mentioned. Nothing is said of the use of these chambers; but they would be, no doubt, for residence of the priests, stores for the Temple, and furniture.<p>The word rendered "chambers" in the former part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm" title="And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:">1Kings 6:5</a> is a singular noun, signifying the whole of this aisle or side building; the "chambers" in the latter part of the verse--properly, "side pieces." or "ribs denote the separate apartments, or perhaps each of the storeys of the building.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And against</span> [or upon, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>; they rested on the wall] <span class="cmt_word">the wall of the house</span> [here meaning both temple and oracle: see below] <span class="cmt_word">he built chambers</span> [Marg. <span class="accented">floors</span>.

Gesenius remarks that the word is used here and in ver. 10 in the masculine of the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the side structure, while in ver. 6 it is used in the feminine of the single stories. The floors bore this name, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;</span>, because they were <span class="accented">spread upon</span>, not inserted into the walls. Rawlinson has evidently confounded this word with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> (see below) when he says, "The Hebrew word here used would be best translated a <span class="accented">lean to</span>." Both words are translated alike "chambers" in the Authorized Version, but the first means <span class="accented">stories</span> or <span class="accented">floors</span>; the second may, perhaps, signify <span class="accented">lean tos</span>] <span class="cmt_word">round about, against</span> [It is doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> is here, as commonly, merely the sign of the accusative, or is the preposition "<span class="accented">with</span>," meaning <span class="accented">"in connexion with," cum parietibus</span> (Seb. Schmidt), in which case its meaning would approach very closely to that of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> above. Bahr remarks that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> are used elsewhere as almost synonymous, and refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a> in connexion with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-2.htm">Psalm 67:2</a>. Keil translates, "As for the walls" (<span class="accented">Anlangend die Wande</span>), but this gives us an unfinished sentence. It is probably an accusative, explicative of the preceding clause = "I mean the walls," etc., the singular, <span class="accented">wall</span>, having being used above. This additional clause] <span class="cmt_word">the walls of the house round about</span> [would then mean that the term "house" is to be understood as including both temple and oracle (and excluding porch), as the next words define it], <span class="cmt_word">both of the temple and of the oracle</span> [The floors, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, ran round the south, west, and north sides of the building. Stanley aptly compares them to the little shops which nestle under the continental cathedrals; though the side aisles of some Gothic churches, viewed externally, would perhaps better represent their proportions] <span class="cmt_word">and he made chambers</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, literally, ribs, beams, (Gesenius); <span class="accented">Rippen</span> (Bahr). The design of the word is clearly to convey that the floors were <span class="accented">"divided</span> by partitions into distinct compartments" (Merz). According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-6.htm">Ezekiel 41:6</a> (where, however, the reading is doubtful) there were thirty-three of these side chambers; according to Josephus (Ant. 8:08. 2) thirty. Thenius is probably not so far wrong when he sees in these chambers <span class="accented">bedrooms.</span> A sort of monastery would seem to have been attached to the temple. So many chambers could hardly have been required for the "preservation of temple stores and utensils" (Keil), or of offerings (Ewald). Whatever their use, we can hardly suppose that they were wholly without light, though nothing is said about windows. They may have had "fixed lattices." It is to be re. membered that the priests and Levites ministered "by night in the house of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>)] round about. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The temple is called the house of the Lord, because it was directed and modelled by him, and was to be employed in his service. This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never further the work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows up in silence, Mr 5:27.</body></html>
