Bahr holds that it had only side walls and cieling (sic), and was entirely open in front; and the fact that no mention is made of any door or opening, though the doors of the other parts of the edifies are all referred to (vers. 8, 31, 33), certainly favours this view, as also does the position of the pillars of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>] <span class="cmt_word">before the temple of the house</span> [The house, or main building (ver. 2), had two parts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">The temple of the house"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> = "spacious," hence "magnificent building," "palace," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-28.htm">Proverbs 30:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>. Gesen., Thes. 1:375). The same word is used of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>), of the royal palace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-18.htm">2 Kings 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8, 15</a>), and of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-7.htm">2 Samuel 22:7</a>, etc.) This was the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">par excellence</span>, and is called "the great house," because of its superior size and height, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-5.htm">2 Chronicles 3:5</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The oracle</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) see on ver. 5.

It would certainly be out of all proportion. Towers are generally built about three times the height of the adjoining nave, but this would be six times as high, and moreover the porch did not taper to a point like a Gothic spire. It is much more probable, therefore, that there is a corruption of the text of Chronicles (see on 2 Chronicles 3:4) - errors in numbers are by no means infrequent - than that such a column could be erected to serve as a <span class="accented">porch</span>, or if erected - and this consideration appears to me to be decisive - could have been passed over by our author without notice. It is impossible, however, to say positively what the height of the porch was. Probably 30 cubits, the height of the house. Stanley characteristically puts it down as "more than 200 feet." It may be remarked here that Fergusson, following Josephus and the Talmud, contends that the temple had another building of the same height above it. See Dict. Bib. 3 p. 1456, and note on ver. 20.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The temple is called the house of the Lord, because it was directed and modelled by him, and was to be employed in his service. This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never further the work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows up in silence, Mr 5:27.</body></html>
