It was, therefore--whatever measure we take for the cubit--a small building. Taking the usual calculation of eighteen inches for the cubit, the whole would be ninety feet long, thirty feet wide, and forty-five feet high--not larger than a good-sized parish church, and in proportion not unlike a church of Gothic construction. It is, indeed, curious to note that this likeness is carried out in the existence of the porch (which is even represented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm" title="And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.">2Chronicles 3:4</a> as rising into a lofty entrance tower), the division of the house into two parts, like a nave and chancel, the provision of something like aisles (though opening outwards) and of clerestory windows, and the high pitch of the roof. This resemblance is probably not mere coincidence; for in the old Freemasonry, which had a great influence on mediaeval architecture, the plan of Solomon's Temple was taken in all its details as a sacred guide. The "Oracle" or Most Holy place, was lower than the rest, forming an exact cube of thirty feet; the height of the Holy place (sixty feet long and thirty feet wide) is not given, but was probably the same, so that there would be an upper chamber over the whole under the roof--which, like that of the Tabernacle, appears to have been a high-pitched roof--fifteen feet high along the central beam, with sloping sides. This is apparently alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.">2Chronicles 3:9</a>, and possibly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>, and in the remark of Josephus, "There was another building erected over it, equal in its measures." The Temple was, in fact, only a shrine for the ministering priests--the outer court, or courts, being the place for the great assembly of the congregation--and it relied for magnificence not on size, but on costliness of material and wealth of decoration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, not the whole structure, but the main building, exclusive of porch (ver. 3) and side chambers (ver. 5)] <span class="cmt_word">which</span> <span class="cmt_word">king Solomon built for the Lord, the length thereof was threescore cubits</span> [But what was the length of the cubit? (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;</span>) This unfortunately is by no means certain, as the Jews would seem to have had three different cubits. All the ancient measures, both Jewish and Gentile, were taken from parts of the body. Thus we find a <span class="accented">"finger-breadth"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>), "<span class="accented">hand-breadth"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-26.htm">1 Kings 7:26</a>), <span class="accented">"span"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-24.htm">1 Samuel 17:24</a>), and the Greeks had their <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Romans their <span class="accented">cubitus, pes, digitus</span>, etc. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is used in its proper sense (<span class="accented">ulna</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>. Probably at first it signified, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, the length from point of elbow to tip of little or middle finger. But it is obvious that this was an uncertain measure, and hence perhaps arose cubits of different length. According to Gesen. the cubit here mentioned, which was the older or sacred Mosaic cubit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>), was six palms, while that of Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>), the royal Babylonian cubit, was seven, but on this as well as other points the authorities are very far from agreed. "The length of the cubit is one of the most knotty points of Hebrew archaeology" (Dict. Bib. 3, p. 1736). There is a general <span class="accented">consensus</span> of opinion, however in favour of understanding the cubit here mentioned as measuring 18 inches. Fergusson (Dict. Bib. 3:1451) considers this to be beyond question. It is certainly noteworthy that the measurements of Kings and Chronicles, of Ezra and Ezekiel, of Josephus and the Talmud, all agree, and we know that Josephus always uses the Greek cubit of 18 inches. Mr. Conder, however, maintains that the Hebrew cubit amounts to no more than <span class="accented">sixteen</span> inches. He says, "Maimonides tells us that the temple cubit was of 48 barleycorns, and any one who will take the trouble to measure barleycorns, will find that three go to the inch" - which gives 16 inches for the cubit. To this argument, which is not perhaps of much weight, he adds, what is of much greater moment, that "the Galilean synagogues, measured by it, give round numbers" (pp. 187-8)] <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</span> [It thus appears that the temple was but a small - compared with many churches, a <span class="accented">very</span> small - building. But its purpose and object must be considered. It was not for assemblies of the people. The congregation never met <span class="accented">within</span> it, but the worship was offered <span class="accented">towards</span> it. It was a place for the Holy Presence, and for the priests who ministered before it.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The temple is called the house of the Lord, because it was directed and modelled by him, and was to be employed in his service. This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never further the work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows up in silence, Mr 5:27.</body></html>
