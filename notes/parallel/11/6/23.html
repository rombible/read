In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-18.htm" title="And you shall make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shall you make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.">Exodus 25:18-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/37-7.htm" title="And he made two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;">Exodus 37:7-9</a>, they are described as having their faces towards the mercy-seat, and covering the mercy-seat with their wings. Here, from the careful description of the outstretched wings, of ten cubits in width for each cherub, meeting in the midst of the house and touching the walls, it would seem that they must have been turned so as to face the entrance. The cherubim over the ark are described only in three places in the Old Testament--in the passages in Exodus, here, and in the parallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/3-10.htm" title="And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.">2Chronicles 3:10-13</a>, and in those great visions of the priestly prophet Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-1.htm" title="Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.">Ezekiel 10:1-22</a>) which have determined the imagery of the Apocalypse. In no case is their form distinctly mentioned, unless, by comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-14.htm" title="And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 10:14-15</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, it may be inferred to have been the form of a winged bull; whence would be naturally derived the golden calves of the idolatry introduced into Israel in the time of Jeroboam. Josephus, indeed, in his description of the Temple (Antt. viii. c. 3, ? 3), expressly says that "no one can tell, or even conjecture, of what shape the cherubim were." The tradition, therefore, must have been lost in the Second Temple, where there was no ark; and this is the more strange, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1</a> the cherubim are said to have been represented in the embroidery of the curtains, and here (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-32.htm" title="The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.">1Kings 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-35.htm" title="And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.">1Kings 6:35</a>) to have been similarly carved on the walls.<p>But, whatever the cherubim were, it is certain that they were in no sense representations or emblems of Deity, like the winged figures of Assyria or Egypt, with which they have been often compared. They appear to symbolise the great physical forces of the universe, as guided by superhuman angelic intelligence to serve the supreme will of God. Thus, when first mentioned in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-24.htm" title="If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.">Genesis 4:24</a>), the cherubim are associated with "the flaming sword, turning every way, to guard the tree of life"; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm" title="And he rode on a cherub, and did fly: yes, he did fly on the wings of the wind.">Psalm 18:10</a>, the Lord is said "to ride upon the cherubim," and "come flying upon the wings of the wind"; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, the four living creatures, or cherubim, sustain the throne of God, and bear it away upon their wings; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8-9</a>, the same living creatures unite with the elders representing the Church of redeemed humanity, in worship of the Lord upon His throne. The representation, therefore, of the cherubim in the Temple simply expresses the claim for Jehovah, the God of Israel, of such lordship over all creation as is hymned in the seraphic song of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>. Possibly the change of attitude of the cherubim in the Temple denoted a change of idea, characteristic of Solomon and his age. The old attitude is clearly that of worship of God: the new rather of manifestation of His glory to man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And within the oracle</span> [The description now passes on to the mysterious symbolic figures which were placed in the holy of holies] <span class="cmt_word">he made two cherubims</span> [As to the nature, composition, and significance of the cherubim, see notes on Exodus 25:19; 37:7.

The wood of the oleaster, which is firm, fine grained, and durable, was used by the Greeks for the images of their gods (Winer). The cherubim of the tabernacle were of solid gold; those of the temple, on account of their great size (fifteen feet high) were necessarily of less costly material. But though of wood, yet the most durable and beautiful of wood, the olive, was employed in their construction. It is noticeable how olive wood is employed for the cherubim and doors of oracle, and for the posts of the temple doorway; the less precious cedar was used for lining the walls and for Beams, etc., while for the floor and doors of house, the commoner cypress sufficed], <span class="cmt_word">each ten cubits high.</span> [Half the height of the oracle.
