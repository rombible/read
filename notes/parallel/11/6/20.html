The A.V. yields no sense] <span class="cmt_word">was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof</span> [that is to say, it was a perfect cube. When we consider that the oracle of the tabernacle was a cube of ten cubits and the Holy City (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-35</a>, especially ver. 20) is a cube of 12,000 furlongs, we cannot but regard these measurements as significant. To the ancients the square seemed the most appropriate shape to express the idea of moral perfection. The idea of the cube consequently was that of entire completeness, of absolute perfection. A little light is thrown on this subject by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> among the Greeks. See the quotation from Simonides in Plat. Protag. 334 A; Arist. Rhet. 3:11; Eth. Nic. 1:10, 11, and compare the familiar "<span class="accented">totus teres atque rotundus."</span> The height of the oracle (internally) being only twenty cubits, while that of the house was thirty (ver. 2), several questions of some interest suggest themselves for consideration. It is perhaps impossible in the present state of our knowledge to arrive at any very positive conclusions, but it may be well, nevertheless, if only to show in how much uncertainty the architecture of the temple is involved, to state them. First among them is this: Was the roof of the temple flat or ridged? (See above on ver. 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In either case, was the height of thirty cubits, or any uniform height, maintained throughout, or was the roof of the oracle some ten cubits lower than that of the house? The analogy of the tabernacle, of which the temple was a copy, would lead us to suppose that the ridge - if there was a ridge - of the entire building was level and unbroken, though the analogy of the Gothic church, which, we have already seen, is almost a reproduction of the temple, suggests that the oracle (like the chancel, and, it may be added, like the <span class="accented">adytum</span> of Egyptian temples) may possibly have had a lower roof. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> supposing the same height was maintained from end to end, to what use, if any, was the vacant space of ten cubits (15 feet) between cieling and roof of oracle applied? It has been held by some that there was a chamber here, but that it was empty, being formed, in fact, not for use, but in order to procure the cubical shape of the oracle. Others contend that this upper room, or one which ran the entire length of the building, was designed to serve as a receptacle for the reliques of the tabernacle, and they would identify it with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. (LXX, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>. And untrustworthy as Josephus is when not supported by independent evidence, it is worth mentioning here that beth he and the Talmud "persistently assert that there was a superstructure on the temple equal in height to the lower part" (Fergusson, who, consequently, is of opinion that there undoubtedly was some such superstructure, as in the tomb of Darius, near Persepolis (see Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1456, 1-457), and that it was used for worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>), where see note). Bahr, however, argues forcibly against this idea. He says, <span class="accented">inter alia</span>, that there was no approach provided to these chambers; but our account is so manifestly imperfect that this argument is at the best a precarious one. He sees in the "upper chambers" (the Hebrew word is plural) the upper stories of the side structure. He agrees, however, with Ewald that there was a chamber over the oracle, but thinks it was unoccupied. Keil identifies this space with the "upper chambers" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>, and upon the whole this appears to be the most feasible view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> How was the cieling, whether with or without this upper chamber, and whether at the height of twenty or thirty cubits - how was it supported? For "no cedar beam could be laid across a space of twenty cubits without sinking in the centre by its own weight." Fergusson hence argues that the roof must have been carried on pillars - four in the sanctuary and ten in the hall. He remarks that they were used in the house of the Forest of Lebanon, where they were <span class="accented">less</span> suitable than here]: <span class="cmt_word">and he overlaid it</span> [lit. <span class="accented">made it shine</span>] <span class="cmt_word">with pure gold</span> [marg. <span class="accented">shut up</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="accented">clausit</span>). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15</a> (Heb.) The same gold is described as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-8.htm">2 Chronicles 3:8</a>). It is called "shut up gold," not because it was <span class="accented">concealed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), but because of the exclusion of impure ingredients (Vulg. <span class="accented">aurum purissimum</span>). The lavish use of gold in the interior of the temple - its weight 600 talents (75,000 lbs.), its value almost incalculable - was not for mere display (for most of it was never seen except by the priests), but was symbolical of light and <span class="accented">purity</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>), and stamped the place as the abode of Him who dwelleth in light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc.</span> The palace of the Lord must be "exceeding magnifical." The overlaying was not gilding, but <span class="accented">laminae</span> of gold were attached to the woodwork with nails. This art was probably derived from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11, 13</a>). Egyptian figures ornamented with gold plates are found both in the Louvre and British Museum. See Wilkinson, "Ancient Egyptians," 2. p. 233 sqq.) Rawlinson remarks that "such ornamentation was common in Babylon, in Assyria, and in Media." See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>; Herod. 1:98; Layard, 2:264. In addition to the gold, the house was garnished with precious stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2, 8</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">so covered the</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">an</span>] <span class="cmt_word">altar which was of cedar.</span> [The italics in the A.V. lead us to suspect a mistranslation, and such it proves to be. What the writer means, supposing the present text to be retained, is, not that Solomon covered the cedar altar with gold, but that he overlaid the (stone?) altar with cedar. It is true the article is wanting, but this may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that the altar is now mentioned for the first time (Keil). It is much more probable, however, that the text has been slightly corrupted. The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Cod. Alex. adds <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), which proves that the Seventy had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> in their text. If so, the absence of the article is at once explained, and an unmeaning repetition in ver. 22 avoided. The mention of the altar - of course it is the altar of <span class="accented">incense</span> that is meant: the altar of burnt sacrifice was outside the building - in connexion with the oracle is significant. In ver. 22 it is called the "altar that (belonged) to the oracle," because it stood just outside it. In the tabernacle it was placed "before the vail" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-18</a>), and it occupied this position because the incense burned upon it was offered before the Invisible Presence within. It is an argument in favour of the textual emendation suggested above that the altar in the tabernacle was of wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>), and that Ezekiel speaks of the "altar of wood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>), the altar of sacrifice being of earth stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24, 25</a>), or brass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>) If we retain the Received Text we are almost compelled to believe that this altar was also of stone, as they would hardly cover a wooden altar with wood. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:15-38 See what was typified by this temple. 1. Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.</body></html>
