But Jehoshaphat's discontent makes it equally clear that they were not in his view true prophets of Jehovah. Probably they were devoted, like the old prophet of Bethel, to the service of the idolatry of Jeroboam.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets</span> [Called by Micaiah "his prophets" (ver. 22), and "thy prophets" (ver. 23)] <span class="cmt_word">together, about four hundred men</span> [From the number (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>) it has been concluded that these were "the prophets of the groves," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Astarte, who escaped the massacre of the Baal prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>). Others have supposed that they were prophets of Baal. But both these suppositions are negatived <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the fact that Jehoshaphat asks Ahab to "inquire at the word of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that these prophets profess to speak in the name and by the Spirit of Jehovah (vers. 11, 12, 24). Moreover <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ahab would hardly have insulted Jehoshaphat by bringing the prophets of Baal or Astarte before him (Waterland in Wordsworth). And yet that they were not true prophets of the Lord, or of the" sons of the prophets," appears <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from ver. 7, where Jehoshaphat asks for a "prophet of the Lord;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from ver. 20 sqq., where Micaiah disclaims them, and is found in direct opposition to them. The only conclusion open to us, consequently - and it is now generally adopted - is that they were the priests of the high places of Bethel and Dan, the successors of those whom Jeroboam had introduced into the priestly office. It need cause us no surprise to find these priests here described as "prophets" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1</a>), and as claiming prophetic gifts, for the priests of Baal bore the same name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19, 22</a>, etc.), and apparently pretended to similar powers. "No ancient people considered any cultus complete without a class of men through whom the god might be questioned" (Bahr). The existence of so large a number of prophets of the calves proves that the inroads of idolatry had by no means destroyed the calf worship. If its priests were so many, its worshippers cannot have been few], <span class="cmt_word">and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;</span> It is very significant that at first they hesitate to use the ineffable name. It was probably this circumstance excited Jehoshaphat's suspicions. It has been said that the reason why he was dissatisfied with this answer is unexplained; but when we remember how careful the true prophet was to speak in the name of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-7.htm">1 Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13, 14, 28</a>), we can hardly doubt that it was their mention of "Adonai "occasioned his misgivings.

They will be drawn to wink at and countenance such conduct and conversation as they ought to protest against with abhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take his religion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with those who have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, at Jerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, but avowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab's prophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: to please Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimic the true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discern the fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all. Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views of religion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashion of the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add. Thus saith the Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are ready to cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to try to secure his own interests, and to deceive others.</body></html>
