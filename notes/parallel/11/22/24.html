but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.">Isaiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm" title="Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops: he has laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.">Micah 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm" title="But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.">Matthew 5:39</a>), but of professed indignation at words of blasphemy against God, or of contempt for His vicegerents; as is seen clearly, when it is recorded as directed against Our Lord or against St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-22.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answer you the high priest so?">John 18:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2</a>). The words which accompany it evidently convey a sarcastic reference to the knowledge of the secret dealings of God, implied in Micaiah's vision, with a view to turn it into ridicule. Micaiah's answer accordingly passes them by, and merely declares the shame and terror, with which Zedekiah shall find out hereafter the truth of the prophecy of evil. Josephus has a curious addition, that Zedekiah challenged Micaiah to wither up his hand, like the hand of Jeroboam at Bethel, and scouted his prophecy as inconsistent with that of Elijah (<span class= "ital">Antt. </span>viii. 15, ? 4).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah</span> [Rawlinson holds that he was a sort of coryphaeus of the false prophets.

But the whole narrative has every mark of naturalness and veracity. It is easy to see how enraged Zedekiah would be at the slight cast upon his prophetic powers. Apparently this gross indignity elicited no protest or word of displeasure from either of the kings. Micaiah, like Elijah, was left alone], <span class="cmt_word">on the cheek</span> [cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-29.htm">Luke 6:29</a>; and above all <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>. Herein Micaiah had "the fellowship of sufferings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>) with our blessed Lord. Rawlinson thinks that his hands would be bound, but this is extremely improbable. In that case Ahab could hardly have asked him to prophesy (ver. 15), or if he did, Jehoshaphat would know beforehand what to expect], <span class="cmt_word">and said, Which way</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">What</span>, or <span class="accented">where</span>. The chronicler supplies "way," thereby bringing the expression into unison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-12.htm">1 Kings 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-24.htm">Job 38:24</a>] <span class="cmt_word">went</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">passed, crossed</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of the Lord</span> [These words are important, as showing that the speaker had not identified "the spirit" of ver. 21 with the evil spirit: <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> sqq.] <span class="cmt_word">from me to speak unto thee?</span> [It is pretty clear from these words, in connexion with ver. 23, that Zedekiah had been conscious of an inspiration, of a spirit not his own, which impelled him to speak and act as he did. We must not attach too much import-ante to a taunting and passionate speech, but its meaning appears to be: I have spoken in the name and by the spirit of Jehovah. Thou claimest to have done the same. How is it that the Spirit of God speaks one thing by me, another by thee? Thou hast seen (ver. 19) the secret counsels of Heaven. Tell us, then, which way, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:15-28 The greatest kindness we can do to one that is going in a dangerous way, is, to tell him of his danger. To leave the hardened criminal without excuse, and to give a useful lesson to others, Micaiah related his vision. This matter is represented after the manner of men: we are not to imagine that God is ever put upon new counsels; or that he needs to consult with angels, or any creature, about the methods he should take; or that he is the author of sin, or the cause of any man's telling or believing a lie. Micaiah returned not the blow of Zedekiah, yet, since he boasted of the Spirit, as those commonly do that know least of the Holy Spirit's operations, the true prophet left him to be convinced of his error by the event. Those that will not have their mistakes set right in time, by the word of God, will be undeceived, when it is too late, by the judgments of God. We should be ashamed of what we call trials, were we to consider what the servants of God have endured. Yet it will be well, if freedom from trouble prove not more hurtful to us; we are more easily allured and bribed into unfaithfulness and conformity to the world, than driven to them.</body></html>
