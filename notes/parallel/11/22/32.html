The chronicler reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> <span class="accented">they surrounded</span> him, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>; and the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, in both places. But the Syrians can hardly have actually closed round the king, and the alteration might easily be made in the course of transcription] <span class="cmt_word">to fight against him</span> [according to their instructions]: <span class="cmt_word">and Jehoshaphat cried out.</span> [This cry has been very variously interpreted. According to some, it was his own name that he ejaculated, which is possible, if the command of ver. 31 was known in the allied army. According to others, it was the battle cry of Judah, which, it is said, would be familiar to the Syrians, and which would rally his own soldiers round him. The Vulgate, no doubt influenced by the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31</a>, "And the Lord helped him, and God moved them to depart from him," interprets, <span class="accented">clamavit ad Dominum</span>. That it was a cry for Divine help is the most probable, because it is almost an instinct, especially with a pious soul like Jehoshaphat, to cry to God in the moment of danger. That he had doubts as to whether the course he was pursuing was pleasing to God, would make him all the more ready to cry aloud for mercy the moment he found himself in peril. But it may have been merely a cry of terror. It must be carefully observed that the Scripture does not say that it was this cry led to his being recognized and spared.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:29-40 Ahab basely intended to betray Johoshaphat to danger, that he might secure himself. See what they get that join with wicked men. How can it be expected that he should be true to his friend, who has been false to his God! He had said in compliment to Ahab, I am as thou art, and now he was indeed taken for him. Those that associate with evil-doers, are in danger of sharing in their plagues. By Jehoshaphat's deliverance, God let him know, that though he was displeased with him, yet he had not deserted him. God is a friend that will not fail us when other friends do. Let no man think to hide himself from God's judgment. God directed the arrow to hit Ahab; those cannot escape with life, whom God has doomed to death. Ahab lived long enough to see part of Micaiah's prophecy accomplished. He had time to feel himself die; with what horror must he have thought upon the wickedness he had committed!</body></html>
