It must be remembered that, as the whole chapter shows, Ahab had now returned to the worship of the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-Gilead?</span> [It is probable this question was asked with some misgivings. Such an alliance was altogether new, and Ahab might well wonder how the idea would strike a pious prince like Jehoshaphat. That the latter ought to have refused his help, we know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>.] <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">as I as thou</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</span> [From the ready and unreserved way in which he at once engages in this war, we may safely conclude that he, too, had reason to fear the power of Syria. Probably Ben-hadad, when he besieged Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), had formed the idea of reducing the whole of Palestine to subjection. And Jehoshaphat would remember that Ramoth-Gilead, where the Syrian king was still entrenched, was but forty miles distant from Jerusalem. Bahr holds that horses are specially mentioned "because they formed an essential part of the military power" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). It is true that in a campaign against the Syrians they would be especially useful (see on 1 Kings 20:1.); but they receive no mention at the hands of the chronicler, who reads instead of this last clause, "And we (or I) will be with thee in the war."] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-14 The same easiness of temper, which betrays some godly persons into friendship with the declared enemies of religion, renders it very dangerous to them. They will be drawn to wink at and countenance such conduct and conversation as they ought to protest against with abhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take his religion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with those who have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, at Jerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, but avowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab's prophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: to please Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimic the true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discern the fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all. Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views of religion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashion of the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add. Thus saith the Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are ready to cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to try to secure his own interests, and to deceive others.</body></html>
