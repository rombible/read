In itself it is, of course, plainly absurd to believe that God's judgment has in all probability been pronounced, and yet to suppose that it can be averted by so puerile a precaution. But, as experience shows, it is not the less on that account true to human nature, especially such a nature as his, always "halting between two opinions."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoahaphat</span> [At Ramoth-Gilead, on the eve of the battle], <span class="cmt_word">I will disguise himself."</span> [same word <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-38.htm">1 Kings 20:38</a>] <span class="cmt_word">and enter</span> [The margin," when he was to disguise himself," etc., is quite mistaken. The Hebrew has two infinitives; lit., to <span class="accented">disguise oneself and</span> enter; a construction which is frequently employed to indicate an absolute command. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; and see Ewald, 828 c. "The infinitive absolute is the plainest and simplest form of the voluntative for exclamations" (Bahr). It agrees well with the excitement under which Ahab was doubtless labouring] <span class="cmt_word">into the battle.</span> [It is not necessary to suppose with Ewald, Rawlinson, <span class="accented">el.</span>, that he had heard of Ben-hadad's command to his captain, (ver. 81). It is hardly likely that such intelligence could be brought by spies, and there would be no deserters from the Syrian army to that of the Jews. It is enough to remember that Micaiah's words, "these have no master," could not fail to awaken come alarm in his bosom, especially when connected with the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>. He will not betray his fear by keeping out of the fray - which, indeed, he could not do without abdicating one of the principal functions of the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), and without exposing himself to the charge of cowardice; but under the circumstances he thinks it imprudent to take the lead of the army, as kings were wont to do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>), in his royal robes. He hopes by his disguise to escape all clanger]: <span class="cmt_word">but put thou on thy robes</span> [LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. "<span class="accented">My robed"</span> "We can neither imagine Ahab's asking nor Jehoshaphat's consenting to such a procedure. Jehoshaphat had his own royal robes with him, as appears from ver. 10" (Rawlinson). If this LXX. interpretation could be maintained it would lend some colour to the supposition, otherwise destitute of basis, that Ahab by this arrangement was plotting the death of Jehoshaphat in order that he might incorporate Judah into his own kingdom. It is clear, however, that Ahab then had other work on his hands, and it is doubtful whether even he was capable of such a pitch of villainy. What he means is, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Syrians have a personal enmity against himself (ver. 81), whereas they could have none against the king of Judah; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Jehoshaphat's life had not been threatened as his own had. "These words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> are not to be taken as a command, but simply in this sense: Thou canst put on thy royal dress, since there is no necessity for thee to take any such precautions as I have to take" (Keil). Do they not rather mean that Jehoshaphat should be the recognized leader of the army in which Ahab would serve in a more private capacity?] <span class="cmt_word">And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:29-40 Ahab basely intended to betray Johoshaphat to danger, that he might secure himself. See what they get that join with wicked men. How can it be expected that he should be true to his friend, who has been false to his God! He had said in compliment to Ahab, I am as thou art, and now he was indeed taken for him. Those that associate with evil-doers, are in danger of sharing in their plagues. By Jehoshaphat's deliverance, God let him know, that though he was displeased with him, yet he had not deserted him. God is a friend that will not fail us when other friends do. Let no man think to hide himself from God's judgment. God directed the arrow to hit Ahab; those cannot escape with life, whom God has doomed to death. Ahab lived long enough to see part of Micaiah's prophecy accomplished. He had time to feel himself die; with what horror must he have thought upon the wickedness he had committed!</body></html>
