(Josephus, characteristically enough, omits it altogether.) The one idea to be conveyed is the delusion of the false prophets by a spirit of evil, as a judgment of God on Ahab's sin, and on their degradation of the prophetic office. The imagery is borrowed from the occasion. It is obviously drawn from the analogy of a royal court, where, as is the case before Micaiah's eyes, the king seeks counsel against his enemies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Hear thou</span> [in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-18.htm">2 Chronicles 18:18</a>, <span class="accented">Hear ye</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>therefore</span> [The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, whence it would almost appear that they had the text <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> before them (Bahr). But <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is every way to be preferred.

It was a real but inner vision (Keil).

To leave the hardened criminal without excuse, and to give a useful lesson to others, Micaiah related his vision. This matter is represented after the manner of men: we are not to imagine that God is ever put upon new counsels; or that he needs to consult with angels, or any creature, about the methods he should take; or that he is the author of sin, or the cause of any man's telling or believing a lie. Micaiah returned not the blow of Zedekiah, yet, since he boasted of the Spirit, as those commonly do that know least of the Holy Spirit's operations, the true prophet left him to be convinced of his error by the event. Those that will not have their mistakes set right in time, by the word of God, will be undeceived, when it is too late, by the judgments of God. We should be ashamed of what we call trials, were we to consider what the servants of God have endured. Yet it will be well, if freedom from trouble prove not more hurtful to us; we are more easily allured and bribed into unfaithfulness and conformity to the world, than driven to them.</body></html>
