Symbolic action was not unfrequent in the prophets. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-30.htm" title="And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:">1Kings 11:30</a>.) The use of the horns, as emblems of victorious strength, is also familiar, as in the utterance of Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm" title="God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.">Numbers 23:22</a>), in the blessing of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm" title="His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>), in the song of Hannah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm" title="And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.">1Samuel 3:1</a>), in the visions of Daniel and Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/8-3.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.">Daniel 8:3-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/1-18.htm" title="Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.">Zechariah 1:18-19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Zedekiah</span> [This name = "Justice of Jehovah," is one of the proofs that these cannot have been prophets of Baal, as Stanley and others suppose] <span class="cmt_word">the son of Chenaanah</span> [ = "Canaanitess." But we gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-10.htm">1 Chronicles 7:10</a> that this, like Shelomith, was a man's name. The Benjamite there mentioned may be identical with the father (or ancestor) of Zedekiah] <span class="cmt_word">made him</span> [Rawlinson would translate, had made him," He says that the horns must have "been made previously, in expectation of some such occasion as that now afforded him." But it is quite conceivable that during the prophesyings, which clearly lasted some time, the idea occurred to Zedekiah, and it would not take long to put it into execution] <span class="cmt_word">horns of Iron</span> [Thenius understands that these were iron spikes held on the forehead. But the reference is clearly to the horns of a bullock, and the appropriateness of the prophetic act is only manifest when we remember that Ephraim is compared to a bullock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>), and more, that Moses spake beforehand of the strength of his horns, and predicted that with them he should "<span class="accented">push the people</span> together to the ends of the earth." Not only, that is to say, was the horn a familiar Oriental symbol of power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-3.htm">2 Samuel 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-24.htm">Psalm 89:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>, etc.), but it was identified in a peculiar manner with the powerful tribe of Ephraim; in ether words, with the kingdom of Israel This symbolical act was not necessarily an imitation of the action of Ahijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30</a>). Such acted parables were not uncommon among the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-15.htm">2 Kings 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-9.htm">Jeremiah 32:9</a> sqq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>)]: <span class="cmt_word">and he said, Thus saith the Lord</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>. He now uses the sacred name; no doubt because of Jehoshaphat's demand, ver. 7], <span class="cmt_word">With these shalt thou push</span> [the word of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>] <span class="cmt_word">the Syrians, until thou have consumed then.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-14 The same easiness of temper, which betrays some godly persons into friendship with the declared enemies of religion, renders it very dangerous to them. They will be drawn to wink at and countenance such conduct and conversation as they ought to protest against with abhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take his religion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with those who have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, at Jerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, but avowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab's prophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: to please Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimic the true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discern the fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all. Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views of religion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashion of the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add. Thus saith the Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are ready to cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to try to secure his own interests, and to deceive others.</body></html>
