The dog and the harlot are the animal and human types of uncleanness.<p><span class= "bld">According unto the word of the Lord.</span>--The reference to the emphatic prophecy of Elijah is unmistakable, and the context fixes its fulfilment plainly as having taken place in Samaria. The difficulty is, of course, the notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25</a>, where the dead body of Jehoram is cast "in the portion of the field of Naboth," evidently at Jezreel; with quotation of the "burden of the Lord laid upon him," "I will requite thee in this plot, saith the Lord." The reconcilement is, with our knowledge, difficult, if not impossible. But the reference in the text is so much clearer, that it must outweigh the other. Naboth, in any case, is likely to have had land in his native place, which would be forfeited to the king; and there would still be an appropriate judgment in making it also the scene of the dishonoured death of the last king of Ahab's house. We may notice, moreover, that the quotation in 2 Kings 9 is not taken from Elijah's words against Ahab, nor does it contain the characteristic notice of the "dogs licking the blood;" though it is noticed as a fulfilment of the subsequent prophecy of chapter 21:24 against Ahab's house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one washed the chariot in</span> [<span class="accented">or at</span>; <span class="accented">Heb</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the pool of Samaria.</span> [Nearly all Eastern cities had their tanks or pools, often outside the city gate.

But this translation is now abandoned, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because it is contrary to the usage of the language to make <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> the object; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because that word occurs in the Old Testament only in the sense of <span class="accented">harlots</span> (Bahr). The true meaning is that given by the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e5;</span>does not require any object such as "<span class="accented">chariot</span>," or "<span class="accented">corpse</span>," for it is found in the sense of bathe (intrans.) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-5.htm">Exodus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-19.htm">Numbers 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-3.htm">Ruth 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a>. Bahr reminds us that harlots are elsewhere associated with dogs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>). This fact is mentioned as a proof of the just judgment of God. Even if these harlots were not prostitutes devoted to the service of the Phoenician deities, whose cultus Ahab had sought to establish in Israel, still the result of his religious policy had been the spread of prostitution. It is a fine example of the <span class="accented">lex tolionis</span>. "He which is filthy, let him be filthy still"]; <span class="cmt_word">according unto the word of the Lord which he spake</span> [the reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:29-40 Ahab basely intended to betray Johoshaphat to danger, that he might secure himself. See what they get that join with wicked men. How can it be expected that he should be true to his friend, who has been false to his God! He had said in compliment to Ahab, I am as thou art, and now he was indeed taken for him. Those that associate with evil-doers, are in danger of sharing in their plagues. By Jehoshaphat's deliverance, God let him know, that though he was displeased with him, yet he had not deserted him. God is a friend that will not fail us when other friends do. Let no man think to hide himself from God's judgment. God directed the arrow to hit Ahab; those cannot escape with life, whom God has doomed to death. Ahab lived long enough to see part of Micaiah's prophecy accomplished. He had time to feel himself die; with what horror must he have thought upon the wickedness he had committed!</body></html>
