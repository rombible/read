Probably the key to the apparent discrepancy lies in the words "and groves" (Asherah). The high places taken away were those connected with the base Asherah worship; those which were simply unauthorised sanctuaries remained, at any rate in part.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he walked in an the ways of Asa his father</span> [Apart from his alliance with the house of Ahab, and the troubles in which it involved him, his reign was alike pious and prosperous.
