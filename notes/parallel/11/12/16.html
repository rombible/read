It had been heard once before, during the conflict between Judah and Israel after the rebellion of Absalom, when it was silenced instantly by the relentless promptitude of Joab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1</a>). Only the last ironical line is added, "See to thine own house, David" (which the LXX. explains as "Feed, as a shepherd, thine own house, David"). There is perhaps a sarcastic allusion to God's promise to establish the house of David: "Be a king, but only in thine own house!"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">brought back word to</span>; probably after some consultation amongst themselves] <span class="cmt_word">the king, saying, What portion have we in David?</span> [Same expression as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>. The words, interpreted by this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>, mean, "Since we have no kindness or fairness from David's seed, what is his house to us? Why render homage to his son? We receive nought from him, why yield aught to him?"] <span class="cmt_word">neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "his tribe is not ours; his interests are not ours." Bahr sees in the expression "son of Jesse" "an allusion to David's humbler descent," but surely without reason. It is simply a periphrasis for the sake of the parallelism. The rhythm almost elevates the words to the rank of poetry]: <span class="cmt_word">to your tents, O Israel</span> [lit., thy tents, Or dwellings; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Disperse to your homes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-17.htm">2 Samuel 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-8.htm">2 Samuel 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), and prepare for war." <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, which means primarily a "tent," has for its secondary meaning, "habitation," "home." This cry - the <span class="accented">Marseillaise</span> of Israel - probably had its origin at a time when the people dwelt in tents, viz., in the march through the desert (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-4.htm">Joshua 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-52.htm">Numbers 1:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-18.htm">Numbers 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-26.htm">Numbers 16:26</a>) ]. <span class="cmt_word">Now see to thine own house, David</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, let the seed of David henceforth reign over the tribe of Judah, if it can. It shall govern the other tribes no longer. "It is not a threat of war, but a warning against interference" (Rawlinson). <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> has the meaning of "look after," "care for." "David, the tribe father, is mentioned in place of his family" (Keil) ]. <span class="cmt_word">So Israel departed unto their</span> [lit., <span class="accented">his</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>tents</span> [see note on ch. 8:66]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:16-24 The people speak unbecomingly of David. How soon are good men, and their good services to the public, forgotten ! These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge. Rehoboam and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we know God's mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind. If we secure the favour of God, not all the universe can hurt us.</body></html>
