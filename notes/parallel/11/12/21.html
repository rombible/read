That a sort of jealousy existed at one time between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, consequent, no doubt, on the transference of the sceptre from the house of Saul to that of David, <span class="cmt_word">is</span> very evident. A thousand men of Benjamin constituted the following of the rebel Shimei, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). The rising of Sheba the Benjamite, again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), proves that the enmity and discontent were not even then subdued. But when the ten tribes fell away, Benjamin seems never to have faltered in its allegiance. The change is easily accounted for. It was the glory of Benjamin that Jerusalem, the joy of the whole earth, the civil and religious capital of the nation, was largely within its border. "The city of the Jebusite" was in the lot of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). But it was also on the boundary line of Judah. This fact had, no doubt, brought the two tribes into close contact, and had given them interests in common, in fact had "riveted them together as by a cramp" (Blunt, pp. 167, 174, who traces "a gradual tendency of the ten tribes to become confederate under Ephraim," and a growing alliance and community of interests between Judah and Benjamin); and now Benjamin could not fail to see that separation from Judah would mean the loss of Jerusalem (which would be largely peopled by the men of Judah, David's tribe, and would be practically in their hands), while adhesion to Ephraim would not prevent the establishment of another sanctuary further north. The traditions of fifty years, consequently, and the common interest in the capital, prevailed over hereditary ties and ancient feuds, and decided Benjamin to cast in its lot with Judah;the more so, as the heads of this tribe may have felt, after once furnishing Israel with its king, as jealous of Ephraim as they had once been of Judah. It must not be forgotten, however, that some portions of Benjamin, including Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, were incorporated in the northern kingdom (Ewald) ], <span class="cmt_word">an hundred and fourscore thousand</span> <span class="cmt_word">chosen men</span> [the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> = 120,000, but the larger number need create no astonishment. At the time of David's census, the men of Judah numbered - if the figures can be depended on - 500,000, while Abijah could muster some 18 years afterwards an army of 400,000 (2 Chronicles 1 [lit., <span class="accented">making war</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon.</span> [It is characteristic of Rehoboam that he proposes forthwith to subdue the rebellious tribes by force. Probably he had no idea to what extent the tribes would prove disloyal.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:16-24 The people speak unbecomingly of David. How soon are good men, and their good services to the public, forgotten ! These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge. Rehoboam and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we know God's mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind. If we secure the favour of God, not all the universe can hurt us.</body></html>
