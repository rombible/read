See on 1 Kings 13:3 (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>). And this meaning is justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-5.htm">Amos 4:5</a>, where the same word is used. It cannot be denied, however, that the word is generally used of incense, and it is very probable that both this and sacrifices were offered by Jeroboam on the same altar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-8.htm">1 Kings 11:8</a>). We may perhaps see in Jeroboam's ministering in person, not only the design to invest the new ordinance with exceptional interest and splendour, but also the idea of encouraging his new priests to enter on their unauthorized functions with. out fear. The history, or even the traditions, of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10</a>.) and of Korah and his company (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>), and the threatenings of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7, 22</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>), may well have made them hesitate. To allay their fears the king undertakes to offer the first of the sacrifices. And that their fears of a Divine interposition were not groundless the sequel shows.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:25-33 Jeroboam distrusted the providence of God; he would contrive ways and means, and sinful ones too, for his own safety. A practical disbelief of God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our departures from him. Though it is probable he meant his worship for Jehovah the God of Israel, it was contrary to the Divine law, and dishonourable to the Divine majesty to be thus represented. The people might be less shocked at worshipping the God of Israel under an image, than if they had at once been asked to worship Baal; but it made way for that idolatry. Blessed Lord, give us grace to reverence thy temple, thine ordinances, thine house of prayer, thy sabbaths, and never more, like Jeroboam, to set up in our hearts any idol of abomination. Be thou to us every thing precious; do thou reign and rule in our hearts, the hope of glory.</body></html>
