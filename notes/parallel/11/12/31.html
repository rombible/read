It is hardly likely that the king would have lacked because at Dan an unauthorised Levitical priesthood was (as has been said) forthcoming.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made an house of high places</span> [See on 1 Kings 3:2, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>. It is often assumed (Keil, Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al.</span> after Josephus) that Jeroboam built <span class="accented">two</span> temples for his cherubim, and the statement of the text, that he built one, is explained on the ground that the historian contrasts the "house of high places" with the "house of the Lord." Ewald, too, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29, 32</a>, understands the words as <span class="accented">plural</span>. But is it not more probable that a chapel or sanctuary already existed at Dan, where an irregular priesthood had ministered for more than four hundred years? This verse would then refer exclusively to Jeroboam's procedure at <span class="accented">Bethel</span> (see next verse). There he built a temple and ordained a number of priests, but Dan had both already. We know that the Danite priests carried on the calf worship to the time of the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>). This "house of high places" has grown in Ewald's pages into "a splendid temple in Canaanite style"], <span class="cmt_word">and made priests of the lowest of the people</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "<span class="accented">from the ends</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from all classes, <span class="accented">ex</span> <span class="accented">universe populo</span> (Gesen.), and not, as the writer explains presently, from the tribe of Levi alone. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-20.htm">Judges 18:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2</a>, prove this to be the correct interpretation of the word. Rawlinson, who remarks that "Jeroboam could have no motive for specially selecting persons of low condition," does not thereby dispose of the A.V. rendering, for the historian might mean that <span class="accented">some</span> of Jeroboam's priests were of the lowest stamp, because he could find no others, or because he was so little scrupulous as to take them. "Leaden priests are well fitted to golden deities" (Hall)], <span class="cmt_word">which were not of the sons of Levi.</span> [Jeroboam would doubtless have been only too glad to have retained the services of the Levitical priests, but they went over in a body to Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13</a>). The statement of ver. 14, that, "Jeroboam and his sons" had "cast them out," suggests that they had refused to take part in his new cult and that thereupon he banished them, and, no doubt, confiscated their possessions. The idea of Stanley, that "following the precedent of the deposition of Abiathar by Solomon, he removed from their places the whole of the sacerdotal order," is a wild conjecture for which Scripture affords not the slightest warrant.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:25-33 Jeroboam distrusted the providence of God; he would contrive ways and means, and sinful ones too, for his own safety. A practical disbelief of God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our departures from him. Though it is probable he meant his worship for Jehovah the God of Israel, it was contrary to the Divine law, and dishonourable to the Divine majesty to be thus represented. The people might be less shocked at worshipping the God of Israel under an image, than if they had at once been asked to worship Baal; but it made way for that idolatry. Blessed Lord, give us grace to reverence thy temple, thine ordinances, thine house of prayer, thy sabbaths, and never more, like Jeroboam, to set up in our hearts any idol of abomination. Be thou to us every thing precious; do thou reign and rule in our hearts, the hope of glory.</body></html>
