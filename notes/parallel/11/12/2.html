This is obviously far more probable, and might be read in the Hebrew by a slight alteration of the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat</span> [see on 1 Kings 11:26], <span class="cmt_word">who was yet in Egypt</span> [The usual, and indeed the necessary, <span class="accented">interpretation</span>, if we retain our present Hebrew text, is that these words refer, not as the context would lead us to suppose, to the time indicated in vers. 1, 3, etc., but to the time of Solomon's death. But see below], <span class="cmt_word">heard of it</span> [The words "of it," though not in the original, are a fair and legitimate interpretation of its meaning. Whether they are retained or not, the natural and grammatical interpretation is that it was the visit to Shechem, just before mentioned, of which Jeroboam heard. But according to our received text, Jeroboam was one of the deputation which met king Rehoboam at Shechem. It has been found necessary, consequently, to understand the words of the death of Solomon, which has been related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Audita morte ejus</span>. Similarly the LXX. Cod. Vat. inserts the substance of this verse as part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>. (The Cod. Alex. follows the Hebrew.) But this interpretation is surely strained and unnatural] (<span class="cmt_word">for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;</span>) [The parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10.htm">2 Chronicles 10</a>. has here, "And Jeroboam returned from Egypt" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5de;&#x5e6;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5de;&#x5e6;</span>). And as some copies of the LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> and the Vulgate has "<span class="accented">Reversus</span> <span class="accented">est de Aegypto</span>," Dathe, Bahr, <span class="accented">al</span>. would adopt this reading here. It is true it involves but a slight change, and it may simplify the construction. But no change is really required, Bahr's objection, that in the text, as it stands, we have an unmeaning repetition, "He was still in Egypt... and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt," loses all its force if we understand Jeroboam to have continued his residence in Egypt (as the LXX. says he did) after hearing of Solomon's death. until summoned by the tribes to be their leader. In any case the repetition accords with Hebrew usage.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-15 The tribes complained not to Rehoboam of his father's idolatry, and revolt from God. That which was the greatest grievance, was none to them; so careless were they in matters of religion, if they might live at case, and pay no taxes. Factious spirits will never want something to complain of. And when we see the Scripture account of Solomon's reign; the peace, wealth, and prosperity Israel then enjoyed; we cannot doubt but that their charges were false, or far beyond the truth. Rehoboam answered the people according to the counsel of the young men. Never was man more blinded by pride, and desire of arbitrary power, than which nothing is more fatal. God's counsels were hereby fulfilled. He left Rehoboam to his own folly, and hid from his eyes the things which belonged to his peace, that the kingdom might be rent from him. God serves his own wise and righteous purposes by the imprudences and sins of men. Those that lose the kingdom of heaven, throw it away, as Rehoboam, by wilfulness and folly.</body></html>
