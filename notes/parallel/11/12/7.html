For the advice of the old counsellors has no largeness of policy or depth of wisdom. It is simply the characteristic advice of experienced and crafty politicians--who had seen the gradual development of despotic power, and had still remembrance of the comparative freedom of earlier days--understanding at once the dangerous vehemence of popular excitement, and the facility with which it may be satisfied by temporary concessions, and perhaps desiring to defeat that private ambition, which was making use for its own purposes of the natural sense of grievance. It is to give "good words," and to be for the moment "a servant to the people," with, perhaps, the intention of abolishing certain excessive grievances, but by no means of yielding up substantial power. Whether it was in itself more than superficially prudent, would depend on the seriousness of the grievances, and the social and political condition of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them</span> [Keil questions the propriety and expediency of this advice. He says, "The king could not become the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> of the people without prejudicing the authority entrusted to him by God." But they do not propose that he should become their servant, except for one clay, and then only in the sense of making reasonable concessions. What they mean is this: "If thou wilt brook for once to accede to their terms instead of dictating thine own," etc. The form of their answer was probably suggested by the temper of the king. They saw what was passing in his mind, viz., that he would fain play the autocrat, and that he resented it exceedingly that his subjects, just as he had begun to taste the sweets of royalty, should presume to parley with him; and they say in effect, "You think that they are reversing your relations, that they are making you, their sovereign, their servant. Be it so. It is but for one day. Then they will be your slaves forever"], and answer them [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, favourably; grant their request; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-6.htm">Psalm 65:6</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and speak good words to them, then will they be thy servants forever.</span> ["Thy servants," in opposition to "a servant" above; "forever" in opposition to "this day."] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-15 The tribes complained not to Rehoboam of his father's idolatry, and revolt from God. That which was the greatest grievance, was none to them; so careless were they in matters of religion, if they might live at case, and pay no taxes. Factious spirits will never want something to complain of. And when we see the Scripture account of Solomon's reign; the peace, wealth, and prosperity Israel then enjoyed; we cannot doubt but that their charges were false, or far beyond the truth. Rehoboam answered the people according to the counsel of the young men. Never was man more blinded by pride, and desire of arbitrary power, than which nothing is more fatal. God's counsels were hereby fulfilled. He left Rehoboam to his own folly, and hid from his eyes the things which belonged to his peace, that the kingdom might be rent from him. God serves his own wise and righteous purposes by the imprudences and sins of men. Those that lose the kingdom of heaven, throw it away, as Rehoboam, by wilfulness and folly.</body></html>
