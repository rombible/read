It was already a city when Abraham entered the Promised Land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>), and is from time to time mentioned in the patriarchal history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.">Genesis 33:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/37-12.htm" title="And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.">Genesis 37:12-13</a>). At the Conquest it became a city of refuge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm" title="And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/21-20.htm" title="And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.">Joshua 21:20-21</a>), and the scene of the solemn recital of the blessings and curses of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/8-33.htm" title="And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.">Joshua 8:33-35</a>). From its proximity to Shiloh, and to the inheritance of Joshua, it assumed something of the character of a capital (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm" title="And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.">Joshua 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>). Then it became the seat of the usurpation of Abimelech, which allied itself with the native inhabitants of the region; but rebelling afterwards against him, it was destroyed (Judges 9). We then hear nothing more of it till this chapter, when the tribes assemble at Shechem, under the shadow of the famous hills of Ebal and Gerizim, to meet Rehoboam. Jeroboam is said to have "built it" anew. This may be taken literally, as indicating that it had never recovered from its destruction by Abimelech, or it may simply mean that he fortified and enlarged it as his capital. Subsequently it gave way to Tirzan and Samaria; but its almost unrivalled position preserved it in importance among the Samaritans after the Captivity, even down to our Lord's time, and under the name of Nablous (Neapolis) it has lasted to the present day, while many other cities once famous have passed away.<p><span class= "bld">Penuel.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/32-30.htm" title="And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.">Genesis 32:30-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-8.htm" title="And he went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.">Judges 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-17.htm" title="And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.">Judges 8:17</a>. It lay on or near the Jabbok, on the other side of Jordan, commanding the road from the east by Succoth to the fords of Jordan and Shechem. Jeroboam rebuilt it--perhaps out of the ruin in which it had been left by Gideon--as an outpost to his new capital, and a royal stronghold among the tribes on the east of Jordan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jeroboam built</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">rebuilt</span> or <span class="accented">fortified</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> naturally has both meanings] <span class="cmt_word">Shechem</span> [see on ver. 1 and on 1 Kings 14:1] <span class="cmt_word">in Mount Ephraim</span> [The <span class="accented">Har-Ephraim</span>, or mountain <span class="accented">district</span> of Ephraim (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16</a> called the "Mountain of Israel;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-15.htm">Joshua 17:15-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-1.htm">Judges 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), is "the central mass of the hills of Palestine, nearly equidistant from the northern and southern boundary of the whole country" (Stanley, S. and P., p. 229), and the richest and most beautiful part of the land. "The tower of Sichem had been burnt down by Abimelech and the tower of Penuel had been destroyed by Gideon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-17.htm">Judges 8:17</a>" (Keil). The <span class="accented">city</span> of Shechem had been destroyed at the same time as the tower, but had no doubt been rebuilt, at least in part, otherwise it could hardly have been selected for Rehoboam's coronation. It was naturally Jeroboam's first care to strengthen his position by fortitying his capital, and the more so as this city would be particularly obnoxious to Rehoboam as the scene of the revolution; but why he should at the same time have rebuilt Penuel - Ewald thinks the seat of government was placed here - is not at first eight so obvious, as it lay beyond the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>) and was therefore presumably outside the circle of hostilities, should such arise. Probably it was because this was the gate to his Trans-Jordanic territory. A tower commanding the fords of the Jordan would secure Reuben, Gad, etc., against invasion from Judah. It is also not unlikely that Jeroboam. who was the great castle builder of that age, had some fears of "hostile attacks from the north and northeast" (Keil), or thought of "the caravan road which led over Gilead to Damascus" (Wordsworth), and of which he would wish, for the sake of his revenue, to retain the control], <span class="cmt_word">and dwelt therein</span> [He made it his first residence and capital]; <span class="cmt_word">and went out from thence</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, when he had secured one fortified city. He could hardly be certain as yet which side some of the tribes would take. It is also possible that some of the workmen who had built Shechem were afterwards employed on the fortification of Penuel], <span class="cmt_word">and built Penuel.</span> [Bahr says, "There is no doubt that he built these fortifications by tribute labour, like Solomon." But is this quite so certain? The people after the revolt would naturally conclude that Rehoboam, of whose proud temper they had had such proof, would want to wreak his vengeance on the city which had rejected him, and the instinct of self-defence would lead them at once to rebuild their walls. And the newborn kingdom would also earnestly desire to possess a suitable capital. Thus their self-interest and enthusiasm alike would obviate the necessity for a conscription.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:25-33 Jeroboam distrusted the providence of God; he would contrive ways and means, and sinful ones too, for his own safety. A practical disbelief of God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our departures from him. Though it is probable he meant his worship for Jehovah the God of Israel, it was contrary to the Divine law, and dishonourable to the Divine majesty to be thus represented. The people might be less shocked at worshipping the God of Israel under an image, than if they had at once been asked to worship Baal; but it made way for that idolatry. Blessed Lord, give us grace to reverence thy temple, thine ordinances, thine house of prayer, thy sabbaths, and never more, like Jeroboam, to set up in our hearts any idol of abomination. Be thou to us every thing precious; do thou reign and rule in our hearts, the hope of glory.</body></html>
