<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-14.htm" title="And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.">1Kings 5:14</a>, we find Adoram (or Adoniram, which is a longer form of the same name) described as holding this office in the later days of David and the reign of Solomon. The Adoram here mentioned must be identical with the officer of Solomon; but, though it is possible, it is not likely that he could have held office in David's time. Probably the name and office were hereditary<span class= "greekheb"></span>. The mission of Adoram shows that, too late, Renoboam desired to deal through him with the grievance of forced labour. But the sight of the man, who had been the taskmaster of their oppression, naturally stirred the multitude to a fresh burst of fury, venting itself in his murder, and perhaps threatening his master also, had he not fled hastily at once to Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute</span> [Probably the same officer as the Adoniram of ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>. For "Adoram," the LXX. and other versions read "Adoniram" here. It is curious that a person of the same name, Adoram (LXX. Adoniram), was over David's levy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>). That there was a relationship, and that the office had descended from father to son, can hardly be doubted, but whether two persons or three are indicated it is impossible to say. It is of course just possible, though hardly likely that one and the same person (Ewald) can have been superintendent of servile work under David, Solomon, and Rehoboam. It is generally assumed that the young king sent this officer "to treat with the rebels and to appease them, as Josephus expressly says" (Bahr). It seems quite as likely that he was sent to coerce them, or to collect the taxes, as a summary way of showing that the king meant to enforce his rights and was not moved by their words. For it is hardly probable that such a proud and headstrong prince as Rehoboam would stoop, especially after the confident threats which he had just uttered, to parley with rebels. Such a man, guided by such counsellors, and inflated with a sense of his own power and importance, would naturally think of force rather than of conciliation or concessions. He would be for trying his whips of scorpions. And if conciliation had been his object, it is hardly likely that he would have employed Adoram, the superintendent of the levy, a man who would naturally be obnoxious to the people, to effect it. Moreover the sequel - Adoram's tragical end - also favours the supposition that he was sent, not "to arrange some alleviation of their burdens" (Rawlinson), but to carry out the high-handed policy Of the king]; <span class="cmt_word">and all Israel stoned him with stones</span> ["With one exception, this was a bloodless revolution" (Stanley). It has been remarked that the practice of stoning is first heard of in the stony desert (Arabia <span class="accented">Petraea</span>). But in reality it is older than the date of the Exodus, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-26.htm">Exodus 8:26</a> shows. And it is an obvious and ready and summary way of despatching obnoxious persons (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-4.htm">Exodus 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>). It is to this day a favourite method of the East for testifying hatred and intolerance], <span class="cmt_word">that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed</span> [So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The Hebrew literally means, as margin, "<span class="accented">strengthened himeself</span>." But the A.V. gives the practical force of the word. He bestirred himself; he lost no time; the death of Adoram showed him the danger of a moment's delay. "He saw those stones were thrown at him in his Adoram" (Hall).] <span class="cmt_word">to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:16-24 The people speak unbecomingly of David. How soon are good men, and their good services to the public, forgotten ! These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge. Rehoboam and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we know God's mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind. If we secure the favour of God, not all the universe can hurt us.</body></html>
