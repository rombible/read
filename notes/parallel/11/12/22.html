And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.">2Chronicles 12:15</a>, it would seem that, while Ahijah belonged to Shiloh in Ephraim, and continued to dwell there, Shemaiah was rather attached to Judah, and hence, that his interference to protect the new kingdom was the more striking and unexpected. In this interposition, to which probably the very preservation of Jeroboam's half-formed kingdom was due, there is a fresh indication of the great opportunity given to that kingdom to maintain itself, under the blessing of God and in devotion to His service. The phrase "your brethren, the children of Israel," marks this with much emphasis.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the word of God came unto Shemaiah</span> [This part of the history is probably derived from the "book" which this prophet wrote (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>). When Keil describes him as "a prophet who is not mentioned again," he has surely overlooked <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm">2 Chronicles 12:7, 8</a>, where we find him prophesying with reference to the army of Shishak], <span class="cmt_word">the man of God</span> [a common expression in the books of Kings. It rarely occurs in the other Scriptures. This designation is not altogether synonymous with "prophet." It is used, for example, of <span class="accented">angels</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6, 8</a>), of <span class="accented">Moses</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>), and of <span class="accented">David</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-14.htm">2 Chronicles 8:14</a>), and would embrace <span class="accented">any</span> minister or servant of God, while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> is restricted to the teaching order. There were <span class="accented">false</span> prophets, but no false men of God. It is also worth considering whether the name of prophet may not have been practically restricted to, or bestowed by preference on, those who had received a prophetic training, the "sons of the prophets" who had been taught in the schools. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>], <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:16-24 The people speak unbecomingly of David. How soon are good men, and their good services to the public, forgotten ! These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge. Rehoboam and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we know God's mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind. If we secure the favour of God, not all the universe can hurt us.</body></html>
