In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm" title="He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.">2Chronicles 13:2</a> she is called Michaiah, and said to be the daughter of "Uriel of Gibeah." This shows that, as indeed chronological considerations would suggest, she must have been the granddaughter of Absalom. She is mentioned below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1Kings 15:13</a>) as prominent in the evil propensity to idolatry.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three years</span> [The Alex.

The" three years" are not to be interpreted strictly. As he ascended the throne in the eighteenth and died in the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign, he cannot have completed three years. But it does not follow that "he cannot have reigned much more than two years" (Rawlinson, and similarly Keil). He may have reigned all but three] <span class="cmt_word">reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah</span> [in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> called <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, Heb. <span class="accented">Michajahu</span>. That the same person is meant is proved as well by the context as by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, where the name is given as here. Keil (cf. Dict. Bib. 2:162) ascribes the discrepancy to an error of the copyist; but the names are so unlike in the original as to discountenance this assumption. I venture to suggest that <span class="accented">Michajahu</span> was the significant form - the word means "Who is like Jehovah?" - which the name Maachah, "oppression," borne by the Geshurite princess who married David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>) assumed when she joined the <span class="accented">Lord's peo</span>ple, and embraced, as no doubt she would <span class="accented">do</span>, the religion of Jehovah. Such a change would be quite in accordance with the genius and traditions of the Semitic races (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30</a>. <span class="accented">passim</span>; 32:28; 41:45; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, etc. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4, 6</a>), and there may well have been special reasons in this case, apart from the piety of David, why it should be made. For the name Maachah appears to have been taken Iron the town and district of that name near Geshur - a part of Syria was called <span class="accented">Syria Maachah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-8</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14, 15</a> we read of a district of <span class="accented">Beth Maachah -</span> and it not improbably witnessed to unhappy memories. How natural it would be that David's bride should take a name of better omen and of a religious import, and how natural that the grand-daughter who bore her name should be called by that name in both its forms. Since writing the above, I find that a somewhat similar idea has occurred long since to others. Both Kimchi and Jarchi hold that she had two names. It is supposed by some that she assumed the name <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, as more dignified, on becoming queen. Wordsworth thinks that Michaiah was her real name, and that it was degraded into Maachah when she was deposed for idolatry. This latter view dovetails with the one suggested above. It would be quite in accordance with Jewish usages and habits of thought that the name which had been changed into <span class="accented">Michaiah</span> when the grandmother became a proselyte, should be changed back into <span class="accented">Maachah</span> when this princess apostatized], <span class="cmt_word">the daughter</span> [rather, grand-daughter. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> includes all female descendants, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (see ver. 10) all anxestresses] <span class="cmt_word">of Abishalom.</span> We can hardly doubt that Absalom, the son of David, is meant here. We have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the express statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, "Rehoboam loved Maachah, the daughter of <span class="accented">Absalom</span>," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The fact that two of Rehoboam's other wives were of the family of David, which shows that it was part of his policy to marry the daughters of that house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The mother of Absalom was named Maachah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The name is so uncommon - in fact, it is <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;</span> - that another person can hardly be intended. Moreover the variation in spelling is extremely slight. It has been held, however, that a different person is designated by the name, principally because Absalom had but one daughter whose name was Tamar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>), whereas Abijah's mother is said to have been the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>). But this difficulty admits of an easy solution. Tamar was doubtless married to Uriel, and Maachah was the fruit of this marriage. And with this explanation agrees the account of Josephus (Ant. 8:10,1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-8 Abijam's heart was not perfect with the Lord his God; he wanted sincerity; he began well, but he fell off, and walked in all the sins of his father, following his bad example, though he had seen the bad consequences of it. David's family was continued as a lamp in Jerusalem, to maintain the true worship of God there, when the light of Divine truth was extinguished in all other places. The Lord has still taken care of his cause, while those who ought to have been serviceable thereto have lived and perished in their sins. The Son of David will still continue a light to his church, to establish it in truth and righteousness to the end of time. There are two kinds of fulfilling the law, one legal, the other by the gospel. Legal is, when men do all things required in the law, and that by themselves. None ever thus fulfilled the law but Christ, and Adam before his fall. The gospel manner of fulfilling the law is, to believe in Christ who fulfilled the law for us, and to endeavour in the whole man to obey God in all his precepts. And this is accepted of God, as to all those that are in Christ. Thus David and others are said to fulfil the law.</body></html>
