Yet we read in 2 Chronicles 45:3, that Asa "took <span class="accented">away</span> the high places (cf. ver. 5). But it is clear, even from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>, that <span class="accented">all</span> of them were not re moved, and the discrepancy arises from the well-known Eastern idiom of putting the whole for the part, of which we have in stances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-19.htm">Genesis 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm">Exodus 9:25</a>, etc. Cf. ver. 32; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a>, and see below. Asa probably aimed at removing all, and he may have removed all out of the <span class="accented">cities</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5</a>), but some remained in the country districts or in remote places. Or he may have swept them away for a short time, and they may have been stealthily and gradually reintroduced. It may be interesting to remark here that down to the present day the <span class="accented">cultus</span> of the high places exists - under a modified form, it is true - in Palestine. Every traveller will remember the <span class="accented">Mukama</span> which crown almost every hill. The religion of the Fellahin, though nominally Mohammedan, is really, like that of China, a worship of the dead. "In almost every village of the country a small building, surmounted by a whitewashed dome, is observable, being the sacred chapel of the place; it is variously called Kubbeh, "dome," Mazor, "shrine," or Mukam, "station," the latter being a Hebrew word, used in the Bible for the places of the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-2.htm">Deuteronomy 2:2</a>)... Just as in the time of Moses, so now the position chosen for the Mukam is generally conspicuous This Mukam represents the real religion of the peasant" (Conder, pp. 304 sqq.)]: <span class="cmt_word">nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the Lord all his days.</span> [We have here a notable instance of the Oriental exaggeration just referred to. For the very same expression is used by the chronicler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>), who in the next chapter (2 Chronic;es 16:7-12) tells us of Asa's unfaithfulness in his old age.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.</body></html>
