There seems no reason to suppose that Baasha had any formal mission of vengeance, or that his conspiracy and assassination were due to any motive but his own ambition. The contrary, indeed, may be inferred from the declaration of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-7.htm" title="And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.">1Kings 16:7</a>, that the judgment on Baasha was in part "because he killed" Nadab and his house. Sin which works out God's purpose is not the less truly sin. Of Baasha we know nothing, except his attempt on the independence of Judah, and its failure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/15-16.htm" title="And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.">1Kings 15:16-22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it cams to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed</span> [Same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-14.htm">Joshua 11:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16</a>.

It is not implied that it was <span class="accented">because</span> of this prophecy that Baasha exterminated the house of Jeroboam. It is probable that, so far from setting himself to fulfil it, he knew nothing about it, and, as he thought, merely took effectual measures for his own security. His seat could never be safe, so long as one of Jeroboam's house survived. Grotius aptly cites, with reference to these wholesale murders, the saying, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>]: <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:25-34 During the single reign of Asa in Judah, the government of Israel was in six or seven different hands. Observe the ruin of the family of Jeroboam; no word of God shall fall to the ground. Divine threatenings are not designed merely to terrify. Ungodly men execute the just judgments of God upon each other. But in the midst of dreadful sins and this apparent confusion, the Lord carries on his own plan: when it is fully completed, the glorious justice, wisdom, truth, and mercy therein displayed, shall be admired and adored through all the ages of eternity.</body></html>
