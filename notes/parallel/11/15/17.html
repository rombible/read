The text, however, implies a further design to blockade the road between the kingdoms, perhaps explained by the statement, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2Chronicles 15:9-10</a>, of the falling away of many from Israel to Asa, now in the height of his prosperity. The new fortress was, no doubt, supported by all the military force of Israel, which Asa, in spite of his increased strength, dared not attack.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah</span> [This statement probably refers to the reconquest of the three cities which Abijah had taken from Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>), as Ramah could hardly have been rebuilt whilst Bethel remained in the hands of Judah], <span class="cmt_word">and built Ramah</span> [Heb. the Ramah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "the elevation," or "high place." Now <span class="accented">er</span> <span class="accented">Ram</span> ( = the height), in Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18, 14</a>), five miles distant from Jerusalem, near the frontier of the two territories, and also then, as now, on the great north road. It was the key, consequently, to both kingdoms. Hence the struggles to possess it, vers, 21, 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>, etc.], <span class="cmt_word">that he might not suffer any to go out</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">not to give any going out</span>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">or come in to Asa, king of Judah.</span> [The object of Baasha in fortifying this place is evident. It was not merely to have an advanced post as a menace to Jerusalem (Rawlinson), but primarily, by its command of the high road, to prevent his subjects from falling away to the kingdom of Judah, or even from going up to Jerusalem to worship; in fact, to isolate Judah and to blockade its capital. That there was a great defection to Ass at this time we know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>. This was an exodus which Baasha felt must be checked. Blunt ("Coincidences," pp. 176-8) has happily shown from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a>, etc., how the primary object must have been to "stop the alarming drainage of all that was virtuous out of their borders." Rawlinson sees in the fortification of this place "the first step towards a conquest of the southern kingdom." But as to this the text is silent, or rather it assigns an entirely different reason.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.</body></html>
