The Mizpah here referred to--for there were many places so called--a city of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm" title="And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,">Joshua 18:26</a>), famous in the earlier history (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/7-5.htm" title="And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:5-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-17.htm" title="And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;">1Samuel 10:17-25</a>), seems to have been situated at the place afterwards called <span class= "ital">Scopim</span> ("the watch-tower"), on "the broad ridge which forms the continuation of the Mount of Olives to the north and east, from which the traveller gains his first view" of Jerusalem (<span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>: MIZPAH).<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then king Asa made a proclamation</span> [Heb. made <span class="accented">all to hear</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>throughout all Judah; none was exempted</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">none free</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> and they took away</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">took up</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha</span> [It is noticeable that it is generally "king Asa," but never "king Baasha"] <span class="cmt_word">had bullded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin</span> [Sometimes "<span class="accented">the</span> Geba," <span class="accented">i.e., height</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>, <span class="accented">Gaba</span>; now <span class="accented">Jeba</span>, only 45' northeast of Ramah. This was the northern limit of the southern kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>). It occupied a striking position, standing on a rocky knoll on the south side of the great gorge of Michmash (now known as the <span class="accented">Wady Suweinit</span>), a "great crack or fissure in the country, with vertical precipices some 800 feet high" (Conder, p. 254; cf. Dict. Bib., 1. p. 658 and Porter, 1. p. 214). As Geba would command the pass, it is easy to understand why Asa fortified it, the more so as this defile "appears to have been more than once the meeting place between the Jews and their enemies" (Conder)], <span class="cmt_word">and Mizpah.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">Mizpah</span>, <span class="accented">i.e., watch tower</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>). The name points to an eminence, but it is remarkable that while so many sites of minor importance have been recovered, this old gathering place of the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17-25</a>), and the seat of Gedaliah's government (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-6.htm">Jeremiah 40:6</a>), cannot be identified with certainty. It has been conjectured that it is now represented by the commanding eminence of <span class="accented">Nebi Samwil</span> (Robinson, 2 p. 328; Van de Velde, 2 p. 53),but Stanley (S. and P., 2. p. 213-4) and Grove (Dict. Bib., 2 p. 389) argue in favour of Seopus, and "the survey has done little to throw light on this question" (see Conder, pp. 257-9). It is to be hoped that the "pit," or well, which Asa made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Jeremiah 41:9</a>), probably "to provide Mizpah with a plentiful supply of water in ease of a siege" (Ewald), may yet be brought to light. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.</body></html>
