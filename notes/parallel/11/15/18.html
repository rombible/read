The Ben-hadad of the text is the grandson of Hezion, who must be the Rezon of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1Kings 11:23</a>. Already, as we gather from the next verse, there had been leagues between Syria and Judah in the preceding reign. Now it is clear that Baasha had attempted to supersede these by a closer league--possibly, like Pekah in later times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-5.htm" title="Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.">2Kings 16:5-6</a>), desiring to strengthen and secure himself against invasion by the subjugation of Judah. Asa naturally resolved to bribe Ben-hadad by presents to prefer the old tie to the new; but he went beyond this, and proposed a combined attack on Israel, for the first time calling in a heathen power against his "brethren, the children of Israel." It was an expedient which, though it succeeded for its immediate purpose, yet both as a desperate policy and an unfaithfulness to the brotherhood, which, in spite of separation and corruption, still bound the two kingdoms in the covenant of God with Abraham, deserved and received prophetic rebuke. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/16-7.htm" title="And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.">2Chronicles 16:7-9</a>.) Just so Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah, denounced the vain trust in confederacies with the neighbouring nations and alliance with Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/30-1.htm" title="Woe to the rebellious children, said the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:">Isaiah 30:1-17</a>).<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left</span> [LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span>, which Rawlinson thinks points to a corruption of our text. He says, "The Jewish treasuries should now have been tolerably full," because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the long peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1-6</a>), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the "very much spoil" they had taken from the Ethiopians (<span class="accented">ib.</span>, ver. 13). Compare ver. 15 above. But the historian has in mind the depletion of the treasury by Shishak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It is true there was nothing</span> "left" on that occasion, but the treasures since accumulated are referred to under this term. It may be the phrase is not strictly accurate, but the LXX. reading looks suspiciously like an emendation] <span class="cmt_word">in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them</span> [cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>. For this act of faithlessness he was reproved by Hanani the seer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7</a>): "O Asa, where was thy piety, while thou robbedst God to corrupt an infidel for the slaughter of the Israelites?" (Hall)] <span class="cmt_word">to Ben-hadad</span> ["the son of the sun" (see note on 1 Kings 11:23). Three kings of Damascus at least bore this name, viz., this king, his son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), and the son of Hazael (2 Kings . 24)], <span class="cmt_word">the son of Tabrimon</span> [the name means, <span class="accented">Good is Rimmon</span>, as to which deity see note on 2 Kings 5:18], <span class="cmt_word">the son of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Hezion</span> [by some identified with Rezin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>), but on insufficient grounds] <span class="cmt_word">king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus</span> ["The centre of the Aramaean power west of the Euphrates" (Ewald)], saying, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.</body></html>
