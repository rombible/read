<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-6.htm" title="And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.">2Chronicles 14:6</a>) was naturally the traditional policy of the kingdom of Judah--small in extent, menaced by more powerful neighbours, but having an exceedingly strong country and central position.<span class= "bld"><p>Diseased in his feet.</span>--In the Chronicles it is added significantly, "in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/16-7.htm" title="And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.">2Chronicles 16:7-12</a>); and from the same records it appears that in his last days Asa ventured to defy the prophetic authority by the imprisonment of Hanani the seer. Prosperity, it is implied, had somewhat deteriorated his character, though he still continued faithful to the worship of God. Certainly, Jehoshaphat on his accession still found much to do for the religious condition of his people.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might</span> [see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14.htm">2 Chronicles 14, 15</a>.]<span class="cmt_word">, and all that he did, and the cities which he built</span> [during the peace in the earlier part of his reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5, 6</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

In the Chronicles (<span class="accented">l.c.</span>) he is reproached for seeking "not to the Lord but to the physicians." We must remember what the art of medicine at that day was like (see Kitto, "Daily Bib. Illus.," 4:195 sqq.), and that the Jews regarded sickness and healing as alike the <span class="accented">immediate</span> acts of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.</body></html>
