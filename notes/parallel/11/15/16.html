The phrase, here repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm" title="And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.">1Kings 14:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-7.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.">1Kings 15:7</a>, appears simply to mean that the old hostile relations remained, combined with, perhaps, some border war; for it is expressly said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.">2Chronicles 14:1</a>, that Asa's first ten years were peaceful, and the open war with Israel did not break out till after the victory over Zerah, in his fifteenth year.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days</span> [This statement must be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1, 6</a>, from which we gather that during the first ten years of Asa's reign there cannot have been <span class="accented">war</span>, properly so called, between them. Indeed, it would seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm">2 Chronicles 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>, that it was not until the 36th year of Asa's reign that it first broke out. But these numbers have clearly not escaped corruption (see note there), as at the date last mentioned Baasha must have been dead (cf. ver. 33 below). It is probable that war is to be taken here, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm">1 Kings 14:30</a>), in the sense of hostility, and in any case we have here another instance of the hyperbolical habit of the Eastern mind.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.</body></html>
