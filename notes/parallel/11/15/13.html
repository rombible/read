and instead of "in a grove," we should read "for an asherah," the wooden emblem of the Canaanitish deity (on which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-22.htm" title="And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.">1Kings 14:22</a>). There seems little doubt that some obscene emblem is meant, of the kind so often connected with worship of the productive powers of nature in ancient religions, substituted as a still greater abomination for the ordinary asherah. Clearly the act of Maachah was one of so flagrant a kind, that Asa took the unusual step, on which the historian here lays great stress, of degrading her in her old age from her high dignity, besides hewing down her idol, and burning it publicly under the walls of Jerusalem.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And also Maachah his mother, oven her he removed from being queen</span> [Rather, <span class="accented">queen-mother</span>. <span class="accented">Gebiruh</span>, as already pointed out on ch. 2:19, answers to the <span class="accented">Sultana Valide</span>. <span class="accented">The Vulgate reads, Ne esset princeps in sacris Priapi</span>. Wordsworth reminds us of the position which the queen-mother Atossa holds in the <span class="accented">Persae</span> (vers. 159-850).

[Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3</a> (where see note), our translators have been unable to adhere strictly to the original "<span class="accented">in</span> the brook," etc., from not knowing that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, which primarily means "brook," also means" watercourse," <span class="accented">wady</span>. It is probable that the <span class="accented">brook</span> was at this time flowing, and that the ashes of the wooden Asherah were cast into it; but the burning also took place in the <span class="accented">Wady</span>, or valley. We read of another similar burning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4, 6</a>; but in this case the ashes were either carried to Bethel or cast upon the graves, to defile them. It is a fair inference that on this latter occasion the Kedron was dry. The valley, "the fields of the Kedron" (ver. 4 <span class="accented">l.c.</span>), is conveniently placed for such a purpose.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.</body></html>
