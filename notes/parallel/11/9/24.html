This and ver. 25 are not interposed arbitrarily, as might at first sight appear, but refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1-4</a>. The completion of the palaces rendered it no longer necessary or proper that Solomon's daughter should dwell in a separate house. The chronicler tells us that she had dwelt in David's palace on Mount Zion, and that Solomon was constrained to remove her, because he looked upon all the precinct as now consecrated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>) ]. <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh's daughter came up</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>.

He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.</body></html>
