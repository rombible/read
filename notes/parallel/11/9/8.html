so that he shall say, Why has the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?">2Chronicles 7:21</a>). The true meaning is certainly "This house shall be high;" which is the reading of the LXX., while the Vulg. has a good explanatory gloss, "This house shall be for an example." Various corrections have been proposed, but there seems no necessity for them. There is evidently an allusion to the lofty position of the Temple. Generally the exaltation of "the mountain of the Lord" is made a type of its glory (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-15.htm" title="The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.">Psalm 68:15-16</a>, &c.); here of its destruction. Its magnificence and its ruin are equally conspicuous: for "a city set on a hill cannot be hid."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at this house, which is high</span> [Heb., <span class="accented">And</span> <span class="accented">this house shall be high</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. Our translators were probably influenced by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-21.htm">2 Chronicles 7:21</a>, the text of which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> which would seem to be an emendation, designed to clear up the difficulty rather than an accidental variation of the text. But here the literal rendering is probably the truer, the meaning being "this house shall be conspicuous, as an example" - so the Vulg. <span class="accented">domus haec erit in exemplum</span>. The LXX. accords with the Hebrew text, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, but the Syriac and Arabic read, "this house shall be destroyed." Keil sees in the words an allusion <span class="accented">implicite</span> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>, and Deuteronomy 28:1, where God promises to make <span class="accented">Israel</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, and says "the blessing will be turned into a curse." The temple should indeed be "high," should be what Israel would have been, but it shall be as a <span class="accented">warning</span>, etc.; but this connexion is somewhat far fetched and artificial. Thenius would read for, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. "ruins," after <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a>; but it is hardly right to resort to conjectures, unsupported by a single version or MS., so long as any sufficient meaning can be extracted from the words as they stand, and no one can deny that "high" may surely signify "conspicuous." Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23</a>], <span class="cmt_word">every one that passeth by it shall be astonished</span>. [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> primarily means to be <span class="accented">dumb</span> with astonishment, Gesen., Thessalonians 3. p. 1435] <span class="cmt_word">and shall hiss</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, like "hiss," is an onomatopoetic word. It does not denote the hissing of <span class="accented">terror</span> (Bahr) but of derision; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15, 16</a>. Rawlinson aptly remarks, as bearing on the authorship of the Kings, that this is a familiar word in Jeremiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-16.htm">1 Kings 18:16</a>; 25:9; 29:18; 50:13; 51:37, in addition to the passages cited above), and that the other prophets rarely use it. The fact that much of this charge is in Jeremiah's style, confirms the view taken above (note on ver. 4), that the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the dream are not preserved to us. The author indeed could hardly do more than preserve its leading ideas, which he would naturally present in his own dress]; <span class="cmt_word">and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land and to this house?</span> [Similar words <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8</a>.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 God warned Solomon, now he had newly built and dedicated the temple, that he and his people might not be high-minded, but fear. After all the services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.</body></html>
