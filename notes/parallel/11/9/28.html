that it was situated to the east of Palestine and approached by the Red Sea (as is clear from this passage, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1Kings 22:48</a>, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-18.htm" title="And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.">2Chronicles 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-10.htm" title="And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.">2Chronicles 9:10</a>), and next, that so famous was the gold imported from it, that the "gold of Ophir" became proverbial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/22-24.htm" title="Then shall you lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.">Job 22:24, Job_28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-10.htm" title="Listen, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people, and your father's house;">Psalm 45:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-12.htm" title="I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.">Isaiah 13:12</a>; 1 Chronicles 4). All else is matter of speculation and tradition. Setting aside merely fanciful conjectures, substantial reasons have been given for fixing it geographically in Africa, Arabia, and India; and of these three positions, evidence strongly preponderates for the second or third. Tradition is in favour of India; the LXX. renders the name as <span class= "ital">Soufir</span>, or <span class= "ital">Sofir</span>, which is the Coptic word for "India; the Arabic versions actually render it "India;" and Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 6, 4) srates unhesitatingly that Ophir was in his day called "The Golden Chersonesus," which is the Malay peninsula. On the other hand, it is urged that "Ophir," in the ethnological list of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm" title="And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.">Genesis 10:29</a>, is placed among the sons of Joktan, clearly indicating an Arabian position; and that the mention of Ophir (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm" title="And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.">1Kings 10:11</a>), stands in close connection with the visit of the Queen of Sheba and the gold brought from Arabia. But neither of these considerations is conclusive. Looking to the products described as brought from Ophir, the "gold and precious stones" would suit either. but India better than Arabia (although, indeed, so far as gold is concerned, Western Africa would have better claim than either); while the "almug," or "algum" wood is certainly the "sandal wood" found almost exclusively on the Malabar coast, and the very word "algum" appears to be a corruption of its Sanscrit name <span class= "ital">valguka</span>. If the other imports mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm" title="For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">1Kings 10:22</a> were also from Ophir, this latter argument would be greatly strengthened. (See Note there.) But putting this aside as doubtful, the preponderance of evidence still appears to be in favour of India. The Tyrians, it may be added, are known to have had trading settlements on the Persian Gulf, and to have rivalled in the trade of the East the Egyptians, to whom it would more naturally have belonged. Various places have been named conjecturally as identical with Ophir: as in Arabia, <span class= "ital">Zaphar</span> or <span class= "ital">Saphar</span>, <span class= "ital">Doffir</span>, and <span class= "ital">Zafari</span>; in Africa, <span class= "ital">Sofala</span>; and in India, <span class= "ital">Abhira</span>, at the mouth of the Indus, and a <span class= "ital">Soupara</span> mentioned by ancient Greek geographers, not far from Goa.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they came to Ophir</span> [It is perhaps impossible to identify this place with any degree of precision. The opinions of scholars may, however, be practically reduced to two, The first would place Ophir in India; the second in southern Arabia. In favour of India is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the three years' voyage (but see on 1 Kings 10:22); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> most of the other treasures brought back by the fleet, exclusive of gold, are Indian products. But against it is urged the important fact that no gold is now found there, south of Cashmere, whilst south Arabia was famed for its abundant gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-15.htm">Psalm 72:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>). On the other hand, it is alleged that in ancient times India was rich in gold (Ewald, 3. p. 264), and that there are no traces of gold mines in Arabia. The question is discussed at considerable length and with great learning by Mr. Twisleton (Dict. Bib. art. "Ophir"). He shows that it is reasonably certain <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Ophir of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a> is the name of some city, region, or tribe in <span class="accented">Arabia</span>, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Ophir of Genesis is the Ophir of the Book of Kings. And Gesenius, Bahr, Keil, <span class="accented">al</span>. agree with him in locating Ophir in the latter country. Ewald, however, sees in Ophir "the most distant coasts of India," and it is probable that the Hebrews used the word somewhat loosely, as they did the corresponding word <span class="accented">Tarshish</span>, and as we do the words East and West Indies. They were not geographers, and Ophir may have been merely an emporium where the products of different countries were collected, or a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> for "all the countries lying on the African, Arabian, or Indian seas, so far as at that time known" (Heeren). See on 1 Kings 10:5], <span class="cmt_word">and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents</span> [The chronicler says 450. The discrepancy is easily accounted for, 20 being expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>; 50 by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>. Wordsworth suggests that "perhaps thirty were assigned to Hiram for his help"] <span class="cmt_word">and brought it to king Solomon</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-28 Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.</body></html>
