<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-34.htm">1 Kings 11:34</a>. David was not perfect, as our author tells us elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-6.htm">1 Kings 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-10.htm">2 Samuel 24:10</a>). His integrity consisted in his unvarying loyalty to the true God. Even when overcome by that fierce temptation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>.) he never faltered in his allegiance to the truth. There was no coquetting with idolatrous practices; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-20.htm">Psalm 18:20-24</a>], <span class="cmt_word">to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments</span> [the echo of David's last words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3, 4</a>. It is probable, however, that the historian has only preserved the substance of the message. It is doubtful whether Solomon himself would remember the exact words]: <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 God warned Solomon, now he had newly built and dedicated the temple, that he and his people might not be high-minded, but fear. After all the services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.</body></html>
