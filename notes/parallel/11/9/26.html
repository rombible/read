It lies at the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the nearest point of the Red Sea, on the edge of the mountain country of Edom. Its very name ("the giant's backbone") indicates the nature of the country around it, which (it has been noted) could hardly have itself supplied timber for ship-building. But from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-18.htm" title="And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.">2Chronicles 8:18</a> it appears that the ships, or the materials from which they were built, were sent from Tyre.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And king Solomon made a navy of ships</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, a collective noun, <span class="accented">classis</span>. The chronicler paraphrases by <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, plural. This fact finds a record here, probably because it was to the voyages of this fleet that the king was indebted for the gold which enabled him to erect and adorn the buildings recently described. (As to form, etc., of the ships, see Dict. Bib. 2. p. 1014). But no historian could pass over without notice an event of such profound importance to Israel as the construction of its first ships, which, next to the temple, was the great event of Solomon's reign] <span class="cmt_word">in Ezion-geber</span> [lit., the <span class="accented">backbone of a man</span> (or <span class="accented">giant</span>). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-35.htm">Numbers 33:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-22.htm">2 Kings 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-17.htm">2 Chronicles 8:17</a>. The name is probably due, like Shechem (see note on 1 Kings 12:25) to a real or fancied resemblance in the physical geography of the country to that part of the human body. Stanley (S. and P. p. 84) speaks of "the jagged ranges on each side of the gulf." <span class="accented">Akaba</span>, the modern name, also means <span class="accented">back</span>. 2 Chronicles <span class="accented">l.c.</span> says Solomon went to Ezion-geber, which it is highly probable he would do], <span class="cmt_word">which is beside</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> = aloud (Gesen., Lex. <span class="accented">s.v.</span>)] <span class="cmt_word">Eloth</span> [lit., <span class="accented">trees</span> akin to Elim, where were <span class="accented">palm</span> trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>). The name is interesting as suggesting that Solomon may have found some of the timber for the construction of his fleet here. A grove of palm trees "still exists at the head of the gulf of Akaba" (Stanley S. and P. p. 20). Palms, it is true, are not adapted to shipbuilding, but other timber may have grown there in a past age. But see note on ver. 27.
