To the record of the great inaugural sacrifice it adds a notice of the solemn renewal of the royal offering, both of victims and of incense, three times in a year--no doubt at the three great feasts, the Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. As has been already said (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-63.htm" title="And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.">1Kings 8:63</a>), there is no reason to suppose that on these occasions, or on any others, Solomon personally usurped the pries?s office.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And three times in a year</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, no doubt at the three feasts, the times of greatest solemnity, and when there was the largest concourse of people. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-12.htm">2 Chronicles 8:12</a>. The design of this verse may be to show that there was no longer any offering on high places. It would thus refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>, as ver. 24 to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>] <span class="cmt_word">did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord</span> [the chronicler adds, "before the porch"], <span class="cmt_word">and he burnt incense.</span> [It has been supposed by some that Solomon sacrificed and burnt incense <span class="accented">propria manu</span>. According to Dean Stanley ("Jewish Ch." 2. pp. 220, 221), "he solemnly entered, not only the temple courts with sacrifices, but penetrated into the Holy Place itself, where in later years none but the priests were allowed to enter, and offered incense on the altar of incense." But this positive statement is absolutely destitute of all basis. For, in the first place, there is nothing in the text to support it. If Solomon ordered, or defrayed the cost of, the sacrifices, etc., as no doubt he did, the historian would properly and naturally describe him as offering burnt offerings. <span class="accented">Qui facit per alium facit per se</span>, and priests are expressly mentioned as present at these sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-6.htm">1 Kings 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-2.htm">2 Chronicles 7:2, 5</a>). We have just as much reason, and no more, for believing that the king built Mille (ver. 24) with his own hands, and with his own hands "made a navy of ships" (ver. 26), as that he sacrificed, etc., <span class="accented">in propria persona</span>. And, secondly, it is simply inconceivable, if he had so acted, that it should have attracted no more notice, and that our historian should have passed it over thus lightly. We know what is recorded by our author as having happened when, less than two centuries afterwards, King Uzziah presumed to intrude on the functions of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17-20</a>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>), and we know what had happened some five centuries before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>), when men who were not of the seed of Aaron came near to offer incense before the Lord. It is impossible that Solomon could have disregarded that solemn warning without some protest, or without a syllable of blame on the part of our author. And the true account of these sacrifices is that they were offered by the king as the <span class="accented">builder of the temple</span>, and probably throughout his life, by the hands of the ministering priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-14.htm">2 Chronicles 8:14</a>). Thrice in the year he showed his piety by a great function, at which he offered liberally] <span class="cmt_word">upon the altar</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">upon that, sc</span>. altar <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>. See Gesen. Lex., p. 94; Ewald, Syntax, 332a (3) ] <span class="cmt_word">that was before the Lord.</span> [The altar of incense stood before the entrance to the oracle, the place of the Divine presence. See on 1 Kings 6:22-3. <span class="cmt_word">So he finished the house.</span> [Same word, but in the Kal form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>. The Piel form, used here, may convey the deeper meaning, "he perfected," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by devoting it to its proper use. It was to be "a house of <span class="accented">sacrifice"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-12.htm">2 Chronicles 7:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-28 Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.</body></html>
