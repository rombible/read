The Hebrew word seems to signify "piling up," or "heaping up," and its most simple meaning would be a "fortified mound." From the mention, however, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm" title="And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.">Judges 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-20.htm" title="But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.">Judges 9:20</a>, of the "house of Millo," in connection with the men of Shechem, it has been supposed to be a Canaanitish word; and it is possible that "the Millo" of Jerusalem may have been the name of a quarter of the old Jebusite city, especially as it is first used in connection with the narrative of its capture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm" title="So David dwelled in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.">2Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm" title="And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.">1Chronicles 11:8</a>). That it was a part of the fortification of "the city of David" is clear by this passage, by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm" title="But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.">1Kings 9:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm" title="And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.">1Kings 11:27</a>, and by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm" title="Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.">2Chronicles 32:5</a>; and the LXX. invariably renders it "Acra," or "the-citadel," a name always applied in the later history to the fortification on Mount Zion. Josephus, in describing the works of Solomon, merely says that he made the walls of David higher and stronger, and built towers on them. From the derivation of the word it is possible that the work was the raising a high fortification of earth crowned with a wall, where the hill of Zion slopes down unto the valley known subsequently as the <span class= "ital">Tyrop?on</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.</span>--These cities were all of important geographical positions, and all had belonged to the subject races.<p><span class= "bld">Hazor</span> was in the north, on high ground near the waters of Merom. It had been the city of Jabin, head of the northern confederacy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,">Joshua 11:1</a>). After the great victory over this confederacy, Joshua burnt Hazor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-13.htm" title="But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.">Joshua 11:13</a>), and the territory was assigned to Naphtali (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-36.htm" title="And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,">Joshua 19:36</a>). But it must have been regained by its old possessors, and rebuilt, for it appears again under another Jabin in Judges 4. It was evidently important, as commanding the great line of invasion through Hamath from the north. Hence it was fortified by Solomon, and probably the native inhabitants were dispossessed.<p><span class= "bld">Megiddo</span> lay in the great plain of Jezreel or Esdraelon, the battle-field of Northern Palestine, commanding some of the passes from it into the hill country of Manasseh, to which tribe it was assigned after the conquest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm" title="And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.">Joshua 17:11</a>). But it was not subdued by them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/17-12.htm" title="Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.">Joshua 17:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-27.htm" title="Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.">Judges 1:27-28</a>), and, with Taanach, appears as a hostile city in the Song of Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm" title="The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.">Judges 5:19</a>). Now it was fortified, and is named subsequently as an Israelite city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm" title="But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.

Its king was conquered by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm" title="Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-12.htm" title="The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;">Joshua 12:12</a>), and the city was allotted to the Levites in the territory of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-17.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:17</a>), but it remained unsubdued (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm" title="Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelled in Gezer among them.">Judges 1:29</a>). From the notice in the next verse, it must have been in rebellion against Israel, perhaps in the early and more troubled days of Solomon; and was accordingly taken by the Egyptian army (which could easily march up the plain, and attack it therefrom). The passes here were of critical importance, as appears in the Philistine wars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.">1Chronicles 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-25.htm" title="And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer.">2Samuel 5:25</a>), in relation to any advance from the plain.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> And this is the reason [or manner, account, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>. Keil: "This is the case with regard to," etc. The historian now proceeds to speak of the forced labour. The LXX. inserts this and the next nine verses after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>] of the levy [see on 1 Kings 5:13, and 1 Kings 12:18] which Solomon raised; for to build [The punctuation of the A.V. is misleading. The Hebrew has no break - "which Solomon raised for building," etc.] the house of the Lord and his own house and Millo [Heb. invariably, the Millo, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The import of the word is much disputed, but Wordsworth has but slight warrant for say. ing that it means fortress. According to some it is an archaic Canaanitish term, "adopted by the Israelites when they took the town and incorporated into their own nomenclature" (Dict. Bib. 2. p. 367), an idea which finds some support in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>. Mr. Grove would further see in it a name for Mount Zion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> being the invariable designation of that part of the city in the Maccabees. But see Joshua, B. J. 5:04.1; Ant. 15:11.5; and Porter, 1. pp. 96, 109. Lewin ("Siege of Jerusalem," p. 256) identifies it with the great platform on which temple and palace alike were built. But the word yields a definite meaning in the ( = aolm], "the filling in"). Gesenius Hebrew consequently understands it to mean, a rampart (agger) because this is built up and filled in with stones, earth, etc. And the name would have a special fitness if we might suppose that it was applied to that part of the wall of Jerusalem which crossed the Tyropaeon valley. This ravine, which practically divided the city into two parts, would have been the weakest spot in the line of circumvallation, unless it were partly filled in - it is now completely choked up by debris, etc. - and protected by special fortifications; and, if this were done, and we can hardly doubt it was done (see on 1 Kings 11:27), Hammillo, "the filling in," would be its natural and appropriate name. And its mention, here and elsewhere, in connexion with the wall, lends some support to this view] and the wall of Jerusalem [We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a> that David had already built Millo and the wall. Rawlinson argues from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a> that these repairs had been "hasty, and had now - fifty years later - fallen into decay," and that Solomon renewed them. More probably the words indicate an enlargement of the Tyropaeon rampart, and an extension of the walls. See note there and on chap. 3:1. Solomon, no doubt, wished to strengthen the defences of the capital, on which he had expended so much labour, and where there was so much to tempt the rapacity of predatory neighbours] and Hazor [For the defence of the kingdom he built a chain of fortresses "to form a sort of girdle round the land" (Ewald). The first mentioned, Hazor, was a place of great importance in earlier times, being the "head of all those (the northern) kingdoms" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). It stood on an eminence - as indeed, for the sake of security, did all the cities of that lawless age (ib., ver. 13 marg.) - overlooking Lake Merom. It was at no great distance from the north boundary of Palestine, in Naphtali (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-36.htm">Joshua 19:36</a>), and being favoured by position, it was strongly fortified - Hazor means fortress - and hence Joshua made a point of destroying it. It appears, however, to have speedily regained its importance, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2, 17</a> we find it as the capital of Jabin, king of Canaan. It was selected by Solomon as the best site for a stronghold, which should protect his northern border, and as commanding the approach from Syria. As it is not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>, it would appear to have escaped in the invasion of Benhadad. Possibly it was too strong for him] and Megiddo [<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. This place was chosen partly because of its central position - it stood on the margin of the plain of Esdraelon, the battlefield of Palestine, and the battles fought there prove its strategical importance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; Judith 3:9, 10 - and partly, perhaps, because the high road from Egypt to Damascus passed through it. It dominated the passes of Ephraim (see Judith 4:7). It has till recently been identified with el-Lejjun (from Legio. Compare our Chester, etc.) (Robinson, 2:116 sqq.; Stanley, S. and P., p. 347; Porter, 286, 287); but Conder ("Tent-work," p. 67) gives good reasons for fixing the site at the "large ruins between Jezreel and Bethshean, which still bears the name of Mujedd'a, i.e., on the eastern side of the plain] and Gezer [This commanded the approach from Egypt, and would protect the southern frontier of Solomon's kingdom. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-12.htm">Joshua 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-25.htm">2 Samuel 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>. It stands on the great maritime plain, and is also on the coast road between Egypt and Jerusalem. The site was identified (in 1874) by M. Clermont Ganneau with Tell Jezer. The name means "cut off," "isolated" (Gesen.) "The origin of the title is at once clear, for the site is an out-lier - to use a geological term - of the main line of hills and the position commands one of the important passes to Jerusalem" (Conder, p. 6). The mention of Gezer leads to a parenthesis of considerable length (vers. 16-19). The question of the levy is put aside for the time, whilst the historian explains how it was that the king came to build Gezer. He then proceeds to mention the other towns built during the same reign. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-28 Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.</body></html>
