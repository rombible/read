It dated, in theory at least, from the Conquest. The most notable example of it is the case of the Gibeonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/9-21.htm" title="And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.">Joshua 9:21-27</a>); but there are incidental notices of similar imposition of serfship in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-28.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.">Judges 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm" title="Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelled among them, and became tributaries.">Judges 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-33.htm" title="Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries to them.">Judges 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm" title="But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.">Judges 1:35</a>. Many of the dangers of the stormy age of the Judges were due to the uprising of these subject races; as in the revival of the northern confederacy at Hazor under Sisera (Judges 4), and the usurpation of Abimelech by aid of the Shecliemites (Judges 9). Probably their subordination to Israel varied according to the strength or weakness of each age; but, when the monarchy became organised under David and Solomon, it was fixed definitely and permanently, although, like the serfship of the Middle Ages, it might vary in its severity in different times and in different regions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>] <span class="cmt_word">which were not of the children of Israel.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-28 Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.</body></html>
