SOLOMON'S BUILDINGS AND UNDERTAKINGS. - So far the historian has spoken exclusively of the two greatest works of Solomon's reign, the Temple and the Palace, and principally of the former. Even the message just related was, as we have seen, the response to the prayer offered when the temple was consecrated. But he now proceeds to mention other proofs of Solomon's greatness, and of the prosperity of his reign - doubtless because the glory of Israel then reached its climax, and the author would be tempted to linger over these details because of the dark contrast which his own time supplied - and this leads him to speak of the means by which all these enterprises were accomplished. The particulars here given are but fragmentary, and are grouped together in a somewhat irregular manner. It would seem as if both this account and that of the chronicler had been compiled from much more copious histories, each writer having cited those particulars which appeared to him to be the most interesting and important. But the design of the historian in either case is evident, viz., <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to recount the principal undertakings of this illustrious king, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to indicate the resources which enabled him to accomplish such ambitious and extensive designs. These latter were <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the alliance with Hiram, which secured him the necessary materials (vers. 11-14); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the forced labour of the subject races (vers. 20-23); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the voyages of his fleet (vers. 26-28). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 God warned Solomon, now he had newly built and dedicated the temple, that he and his people might not be high-minded, but fear. After all the services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.</body></html>
