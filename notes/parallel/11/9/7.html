The destruction of the Temple is by him compared with that which fell on Shiloh--no doubt, after the great defeat by the Philistines in the time of Eli (1 Samuel 4, 5), although the history gives no record of it. The continued existence of the people, as a people, to be "a proverb and a byword," through the Babylonish captivity, and through their present dispersion, is a fact to which the history of the world undoubtedly furnishes no parallel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them</span> [Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26, 27</a>; and for the fulfilment see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11, 21</a>;] <span class="cmt_word">and this house which I have hallowed for my name</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a>] <span class="cmt_word">will I cast out of my sight</span> [same expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people</span> [the exact words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>.

After all the services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.</body></html>
