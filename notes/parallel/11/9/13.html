Josephus evidently did not know it as a Hebrew word; for he expressly says, that in the Phaenician language it signifies "what is unpleasing." (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 100:5, sect. 3). A city Cabul is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm" title="And turns toward the sun rise to Bethdagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,">Joshua 19:27</a>, in the territory of Asher, evidently on the Tyrian frontier, and in the neighbourhood in question. Hiram, it is thought, takes up this name, and applies it to the whole territory, and by a play of words on it signifies his discontent with Solomon's gift. Ewald supposes a Hebrew derivation for the word ("as nought"); others take it to be "like that which vanishes." Either would suit the sense indicated in the text well; but unless these derivations represent something cognate in the Tyrian language, they hardly accord with the requirements of this passage, which (as Josephus says) implies a Phoenician origin for the word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, What cities</span> are <span class="cmt_word">these which thou hast given me, my brother?</span> [Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-32.htm">1 Kings 20:32</a>. It would seem, at first sight, as if this form of speech was then, as now, the usage of courts. But the <span class="accented">Fellahin</span> of Palestine, the "modern Canaanites," still address each other as "my father" or "my brother." See Conder, "Tent-work," p. 332]. <span class="cmt_word">And he called them the land of Cabul</span> [The meaning of this word is quite uncertain. The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which shows that they must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>; indeed, it is possible that the words have the same meaning (Gesen.) Stanley (S. and P. p. 364) thinks these cities formed the <span class="accented">boundary</span> between the two kingdoms, and refers to the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>, etc. According to Josephus, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, is a Phoenician word, meaning <span class="accented">displeasing</span>; but his etymologies are to be received with caution, and Gesenius justly pronounces this a mere conjecture from the context. Thenius and Ewald regard the word as compounded of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented"> = as nothing</span>; Keil connects it with the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, which would yield the meaning <span class="accented">pawned</span> or <span class="accented">pledged</span>, and hence concludes that, this strip of territory was merely given to Hiram as a security for the repayment of a loan (see below on ver. 14); while Bahr derives it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, an unused root, akin to the preceding - <span class="accented">vinxit, constrinxit</span>, and would see in it a name bestowed on the region because of its <span class="accented">confined</span> geographical position. He does not understand the word, however, as a term of contempt. "How," he asks, "could Hiram give the district a permanent name which contained a mockery of himself rather than of the land?" But the word was obviously an expression of disparagement, if not disgust, which, falling from Hiram's lips, was caught up and repeated with a view to mark not so much his displeasure as Solomon's meanness. But it is not necessary to find a meaning for the word, for it is to be considered that a city Bearing this name existed at that time and in this neighbourhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), the site of which, in all probability, is marked by the modern <span class="accented">Kabul</span>, eight miles east of Accho (Robinson, 3:87, 88; Dict. Bib. 1:237; Thomson, "Land and Book," 1:281, 511). It is possible, indeed, that it may have been one of the "twenty cities" (ver. 11) given to Hiram. And if this city, whether within or without the district of Galilee, were notorious for its poverty or meanness, or conspicuous by its bleak situation, we can at once understand why Hiram should transfer the name to the adjoining region, even if that name, in itself, had no special significance] unto this day. [See on 1 Kings 8:8.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-14 Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities. Hiram did not like them. If Solomon would gratify him, let it be in his own element, by becoming his partner in trade, as he did. See how the providence of God suits this earth to the various tempers of men, and the dispositions of men to the earth, and all for the good of mankind in general.</body></html>
