(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-14.htm" title="Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred three score and six talents of gold,">1Kings 10:14</a>.) How it is connected with the previous verses is matter of conjecture. It may possibly be a note referring back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm" title="(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.">1Kings 9:11</a>, and explaining the amount of gold which Hiram had sent. If this is not so, it would then seem to be a payment in acknowledgment of the cession of the cities, as being of greater value than the debt which it was meant to discharge. Hiram's depreciation of the cities need not imply that he did not care to keep them. "It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-14.htm" title="It is naught, it is naught, said the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.">Proverbs 20:14</a>). Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 5, 3), has a quaint story in connection with this intercourse between Hiram and Solomon (quoted from Dios), declaring that a contest in riddles took place between these kings, and that, when Hiram could not solve the riddles of Solomon, he "paid a large sum of money for his fine," but adds that he afterwards retaliated on Solomon, by aid of Abdemon of Tyre. It appears by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-2.htm" title="And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.">2Chronicles 7:2</a>, that the cities were afterwards restored to Israel--how, and why, we know not.<p>(15 28) The rest of the chapter consists of brief historical notes, partly referring back to the previous records. Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1Kings 9:15</a> refers back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm" title="And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.">1Kings 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,">1Kings 9:20-22</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm" title="And Solomon had three score and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;">1Kings 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm" title="But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.">1Kings 9:24</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm" title="And his house where he dwelled had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like to this porch.">1Kings 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-25.htm" title="And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.">1Kings 9:25</a> is a note connected with the history of the dedication of the Temple. The style is markedly different from the graphic and picturesque style of the passages preceding and following it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - And Hiram sent <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> must be understood as pluperfect, "<span class="accented">Now</span> <span class="accented">Hiram had sent</span>," referring to verse 11. This fact is mentioned to explain the gift of the cities, viz., that they were in payment for the gold he had furnished. The timber and stone and labour had been paid for in corn and wine and oil See on 1 Kings 5:11] <span class="cmt_word">to the king sixscore talents of gold</span>. [This sum is variously estimated at from half a million to a million and a quarter of our money. (Keil, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., and Dict. Bib. 3:1734. It equalled 3000 shekels of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-26</a>). Keil, who, as we have seen, interprets Cabul to mean <span class="accented">pledged</span>, says somewhat positively that these 120 talents were merely lent to Solomon to enable him to prosecute his undertakings, and that the twenty cities were Hiram's security for its repayment. He further sees in the restoration of these cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>, where see note) a proof that Solomon must have repaid the amount lent him. The "sixscore talents "should be compared with the 120 talents of ch. 10:10, and the 666 talents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14</a>.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-14 Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities. Hiram did not like them. If Solomon would gratify him, let it be in his own element, by becoming his partner in trade, as he did. See how the providence of God suits this earth to the various tempers of men, and the dispositions of men to the earth, and all for the good of mankind in general.</body></html>
