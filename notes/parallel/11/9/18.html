The three, Gezer, Beth-horon, and Baalath, evidently form a group of fortified places commanding the passes from the sea-coast.<p><span class= "bld">Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land.</span>--The Hebrew text here has <span class= "ital">Tamar</span> (with, however, <span class= "ital">Tadmor</span> as a marginal reading). From this fact, and from the peculiar expression "in the land," which certainly seems to designate the land of Israel, and from the juxtaposition of the name in this passage with the names of places situated in the southern part of Palestine, it has been thought that the place meant is the Tamar of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm" title="And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.">Ezekiel 47:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-28.htm" title="And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.">Ezekiel 48:28</a>), or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">Hazazon-Tamar</span>, the old name of En-gedi; and that the marginal reading, and the reading of the old versions, have arisen from a mistaken identification of this place with the Tadmor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-4.htm" title="And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.">2Chronicles 9:4</a>. But, on the whole, these considerations are not sufficient to counterbalance the invariable reference of this passage, by all the ancient versions and by the narrative of Josephus, to the celebrated <span class= "ital">Tadmor, </span>the name of which is a local variety of the Hebrew name <span class= "ital">Tamar</span> (or "the palm-tree,") preserved in the later name of Palmyra. If this be meant, it is indeed difficult to suppose that there is not some omission after the words "in the land."<p><span class= "bld">Tadmor</span>, or Palmyra, is described by Josephus as "in the desert above Syria, a day's journey from the Euphrates, and six long days' journey from Babylon the Great." Its foundation is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-4.htm" title="And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.">2Chronicles 9:4</a>, as connected with a subjugation of Hamathzobah, and it may have had a military purpose. But situated on a well-watered oasis, in the midst of the desert, south-west of Tiphsah or Thapsacus on the Euphrates, also occupied by Solomon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm" title="For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.">1Kings 4:24</a>), and about 120 miles from Damascus, it would be eminently fitted for trade both with Damascus and with Babylon and the north. Its importance is indicated by its long existence as a great city, and by its splendour (still traceable in its ruins), in Greek and Roman times, down to, at least, the age of Diocletian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Baalath</span> [probably the place mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>, and therefore a town of Daniel By some it has been identified, but on wholly insufficient grounds - the mention of Tadmor immediately afterwards being the chief - with Baalbek. This is one of the names which prove how ancient and widespread was the worship of Baal (Gesen., Thesaurus, 225; Dict. Bib., 1:147,148) ] <span class="cmt_word">and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land.</span> [Whether this is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the famous Palmyra, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Tamar, an obscure town of south Judah, is a question which has been much disputed. It should be stated in the first place that the <span class="accented">Cethib</span> has <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>, but the <span class="accented">Keri</span>, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>, reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>, as do all the versions; and secondly that a <span class="accented">Tarnar</span> is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a> and Ezekiel 48:28 a place which may well be identical with "Hazazon Tamar, which is Engedi" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>. In favour of (1) are the following considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the statement of the chronicler that Solomon did build Palmyra (for of the identity of "Tadmor" with Palmyra there can be no reasonable doubt; see Dict. Bib. 3:1428). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The probability that Solomon, with his wide views of commerce, would seize upon and fortify the one oasis in the great Syrian desert in order to establish an <span class="accented">entrepot</span> there (see on ver. 19). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words "in the wilderness," which, of course, are eminently true of Palmyra. Against it, however, may be urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Tamar was much more likely to be changed into Tadmor than Tadmor into Tamar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That this place is distinctly described as "in the land," which, <span class="accented">strictly</span>, Palmyra was not. But here it is to be observed that the chronicler omits these words, and that the Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate render, "in the land of the wilderness." Keil says our text is manifestly corrupt, and certainly the expression is a singular one. Some would, therefore, alter <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5e5;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span>, or into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span> (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>). Both of the emendations, however, while undoubtedly plausible, are purely conjectural. Wordsworth, who thinks Palmyra is meant, says it is described as "in the land" to indicate that God had fulfilled his promise to extend <span class="accented">the land</span> of Solomon far eastward into the <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>). And a Jewish historian, especially in the time of his country s decadence, might well recount how this great city had once been comprised within the boundaries of Israel. In favour of (2) are these facts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it is the reading of the text. It is said, however, that the ancient name of Tadmor was Tamar, and the place clearly owed its name to the <span class="accented">Palm</span> trees. But the name is always <span class="accented">Tadmor</span> in the Palmyrene inscriptions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That this place was "in the wilderness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Judah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That it was "in the land," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it was in close proximity to the places just mentioned. The evidence is thus so evenly balanced that it is impossible to decide positively between the two. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-28 Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.</body></html>
