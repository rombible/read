How greatly their seamanship, their commerce, and their civilisation impressed the imagination of Israel, is shown in the magnificent chapters of Ezekiel on the fate of Tyre (Ezekiel 26-28). The Israelites, on the contrary, had but little care for the sea, and little knowledge of seamanship. The coast line of Palestine is but scantily furnished with harbours; and even at the height of their power they were content to use the maritime skill of the Tyrians, without encroaching upon their commerce or attempting to seize their famous ports. This was natural; for their call to be a peculiar and separate people was absolutely incompatible with maritime enterprise and commerce. Even in this attempt at maritime expedition under Tyrian guidance, Solomon's action was, as in other points, exceptional, departing from Israelite tradition; and we hear of no similar enterprise, except in the age of Ahab and Jehoshaphat, when the intermarriage of the royal houses of Israel and Ph?nicia renewed the close connection with Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-35.htm" title="And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:">2Chronicles 20:35</a>). We observe, accordingly, that the sea is mostly regarded in the Old Testament in its terrible power of wave and storm, restrained from destroying only by the Almighty hand of God; and even the one psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/107-23.htm" title="They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;">Psalm 107:23-31</a>), which describes the seafarer's experience, dwells with awe on "God's wonders in the deep." In the description of the glory of "the new heaven and earth" of the hereafter, it is declared with emphasis that "there was no more sea" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of Solomon.</span> [The chronicler states (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-18.htm">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>) that he sent ships as well as servants, and it has been thought that ships were transported, in parts or entire, by land across the Isthmus of Suez, and there are certainly instances on record of the land transport of fleets. (Keil reminds us that Alexander the Great, according to Arrian, had snips transported - in pieces - from Phoenicia to the Euphrates, and that, according to Thucydides (Bell. Pelop. 4:8) the Peloponnesians conveyed 60 ships from Corcyra across the Leucadian Isthmus, etc.) But this, especially when the state of engineering science, etc., among the Hebrews is taken into account, is hardly to be thought cf. It is quite possible, however, that <span class="accented">timber</span> for shipbuilding was floated on the Mediterranean down to the river of Egypt, or some such place, and then transported either to Suez or to Akaba. Probably all that the chronicler means is that Hiram provided the materials and had the ships built. The Israelites, having hitherto had no fleet, and little or no experience of the sea, were unable to construct ships for themselves. And the Tyrians may have seen in the construction of a fleet for <span class="accented">eastern</span> voyages, an opening for the extension of their own maritime trade. Possibly in the first voyages Tyriaus and Jews were copartners.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-28 Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.</body></html>
