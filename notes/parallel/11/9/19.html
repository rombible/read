The fact that these store cities are mentioned in the same breath with Tadmor, is an argument for the identification of that place with Palmyra, which Solomon could only have built as a means of gaining or retaining control over the caravan trade between the East and the Mediterranean. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48</a>.

It should be remembered that Solomon had an adversary in Damascus], <span class="cmt_word">and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen</span> [Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>. These were not so much fortresses (vers. 15-18) as places adapted to accommodate his cavalry, etc. For <span class="accented">horsemen</span> we should perhaps read <span class="accented">horses</span>. See note on 1 Kings 5:6], <span class="cmt_word">and that which Solomon desired to build</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and the desire of Solomon which he desired</span>; cf. ver. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The use of the cognate verb refutes the idea that Solomon's "desire" is another name for pleasure buildings or pleasaunces, as does also "desire" in ver. 11. It is certain, however, that such buildings were erected, and it is probable that they are referred to here] <span class="cmt_word">in Jerusalem and in Lebanon</span> [It is highly probable that pleasure houses were built in Lebanon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>), for which Solomon may well have had a strong affection, and pleasure gardens in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4-7</a>). See Stanley, pp. 197-199); and we may reasonably imagine (with Ewald) that in these latter he sought to grow specimens of the plants, etc., about which he "spoke" (ch. 4:33; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>). "It is a curious fact that in the ground hard by the 'fountains of Solomon' near Bethlehem, which exhibit manifest traces of an ancient garden, and where the intimations of Josephus would lead us to suppose that Solomon had a rural retreat, are still to be found a number of plants self sown from age to age, which do not exist in any other part of the Holy Land" (Kitto, "Bib. Illus." vol. 4. p. 101). Some of Solomon's journeys to these favourite resorts, we can hardly doubt, are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a> sqq.; Song of Solomon 6:11] <span class="cmt_word">and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-28 Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.</body></html>
