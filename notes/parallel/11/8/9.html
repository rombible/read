and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.">Numbers 17:10</a>), the copy of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/31-24.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>)--were not in the ark, but (as in the last case is actually stated), at "the side of the ark." Unless any change afterwards took place--which is highly improbable--this clear statement must determine the interpretation of the well-known passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm" title="And if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my judgments:">1Kings 9:4</a>), in which no stress need be laid on the literal accuracy of the word "wherein;" for its purpose is simply a general description of the Temple, its chief parts, and its most sacred furniture. The command to deposit the tables in the ark is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm" title="And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.">Exodus 25:16</a>, and the actual deposit of them there in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm" title="And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark:">Exodus 40:20</a>, immediately after the erection of the Tabernacle.<p>There is something singularly impressive in the especial hallowing of the granite tables of the Law of Righteousness, as the most sacred of all the revelations of the Nature of God; thus indissolubly binding together religion and morality, and showing that God is best known to man, not in His omnipotence, or even in His infinite wisdom, which man can only in slight degree imitate, but in His moral nature, as the very Truth and Righteousness, of which all that in man is called true and righteous is but the reflection. The one main object of all prophetic teaching was to bring out the truth here implied, thus writing the law on the heart and on the mind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm" title="But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, said the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Jeremiah 31:33</a>), and rebuking moral evil at least as strongly as religious error and apostasy. The very name of the Messiah for whom they prepared is "Jehovah our righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>. This statement appears to be at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, which mentions "the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded," as in the ark, along with "the tables of the covenant." And it is to be observed that, while our text excludes these relics from the ark (<span class="accented">temp</span>. Solomon), no other scripture save that just cited expressly includes them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a> and Numbers 17:25 (Heb. A.V., Numbers 17:10) they are commanded to be laid up "before the testimony," words which no doubt may mean, as they were long interpreted to mean, "before the tables of testimony in the ark" - observe, the words are "before the <span class="accented">testimony</span>," not "before the <span class="accented">ark"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> but which are now generally thought to import "in front of the ark which con-rained the testimony." We know the book of the law was put "at the side (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) of the ark" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>), and hence it is held by some that the golden pot, etc., occupied a similar position. It seems preferable, however, considering the distinct statement of St. Paul, or the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which, to say the least, embodies Jewish tradition, to adhere to the ancient interpretation that the golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod were in the ark. And this in no wise conflicts with the statement of the text, for these treasures might well have been removed by the Philistines, whose first thought, we may be sure, would be to open their new acquisition. It is not improbable, indeed, that the object of the men of Bethshemesh in looking into the ark was to see whether these treasures were still there. For if the golden pot ever was in the ark, we can hardly suppose it would escape the rapacity of the Philistines, who would leave the two tables of stone as things of no value. Indeed, it is just possible that the trespass offering, the golden mice, etc., were designed as a return for the golden pot which had been removed. And the statement of the text, "there was nothing," etc., almost implies that there had been something there at one time (see Alford on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). It seem probable, therefore, that the golden pot and Aaron's rod were originally deposited "before the testimony" in the ark; that they were removed during its captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>.); and that the sacrilege was discovered at Bethshemesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). This last mentioned episode explains how it came to be known that "there was nothing," etc. It is hardly likely after that memorable visitation that Solomon could have opened the ark and taken out the two relics, as Rawlinson suggests. Nor have we any warrant for the view that the mercy seat, with the cherubs, was removed to make way for a new lid without them, and so the interior of the ark was disclosed to view (Stanley) ] <span class="cmt_word">at Horeb</span> [See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-6.htm">Exodus 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>. This name, which means <span class="accented">dry ground, desert</span>, would appear to have belonged to two or three different places in the wilderness. But as the name of the place where the law was given and the covenant with God made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10, 13</a>) it became subsequently a <span class="accented">nomen</span> <span class="accented">generale</span> for the whole of the Sinaitic region (Dict.

The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison with the sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the Divine glory is unveiled.</body></html>
