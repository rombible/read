In the visions of Ezekiel the same glory is seen, first filling the house of the Lord, and then departing from it, as polluted by manifold idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-4.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.">Ezekiel 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-18.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:18</a>). Its return to the restored Temple is solemnly promised by Haggai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm" title="And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-9.htm" title="The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:9</a>) in distinct reference to the coming of the Messiah; and it is declared that it shall be even greater than in the magnificence of Solomon's Temple. The symbol clearly implies a revelation of Divine glory, as it is seen, not in the unveiled brightness of heaven, but in the glorious cloud of mystery; through which it must always be seen on earth, and which, indeed, is all that the eye of man can bear to contemplate. Out of that glory comes the only revelation which can be distinct to man--the voice or the word of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>).<p>The record of the Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/5-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:">2Chronicles 5:11-13</a>)--dwelling, as usual, on the musical and ritual service of the Levites--notes here that this descent of the glory of the Lord came, as it were, in answer to a solemn burst of worship from the Levites and the people, "praising the Lord, because He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out</span> [Rather, <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">the priests came out</span>] of <span class="cmt_word">the holy place</span> [It has been supposed that "the holy" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is here put for the <span class="accented">most</span> holy place, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a>. But this is not by any means the necessary interpretation. The cloud may obviously have filled the <span class="accented">entire</span> building only as the priests left it. It would seem, however, from verse 11 as if the priests, having left the <span class="accented">oracle</span>, were about to min later in the holy place], <span class="cmt_word">that</span> <span class="cmt_word">the cloud</span> [Observe the article; the well known cloud which betokened the Divine presence. It had rested upon the tabernacle on the day that it was dedicated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>), had ac companied it in its journeys (<span class="accented">ib</span>. ver. 38), and had apparently been specially displayed at certain junctures in the history of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-5.htm">Numbers 12:5, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-42.htm">Numbers 16:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-15.htm">Deuteronomy 31:15</a>). ]t was thus the acknowledged symbol of God's presence, and as such was a visible sign that He now accepted the temple, as He had formerly accepted the tabernacle, as His shrine and dwelling place. It is hardly correct to identify the cloud with the Shechinah of the Targums (Rawlinson), for it is noticeable that the Targums never render "the cloud" or "the glory" by "the Shechinah." In fact, as regards the use of the word by Jewish writers, it would seem to be a periphrasis for God (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1241). We may see in the cloud, however, the <span class="accented">seat</span> of the Shechinah (Kitto, Cyclopedia, 3. p. 821) <span class="cmt_word">filled the house of the Lord.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 The bringing in the ark, is the end which must crown the work: this was done with great solemnity. The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison with the sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the Divine glory is unveiled.</body></html>
