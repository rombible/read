At all times he who brought the sacrifice was said to "offer" it. (See, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.">Leviticus 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-7.htm" title="If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD.">Leviticus 3:7</a>, &c.) The priest accepted it in the name of the Lord, and poured the blood at the foot of the altar of sacrifice, or sprinkled it on the altar of incense. But still the absence of all mention of the priests, even as to the "hallowing" of the court for sacrifice, is characteristic of the tone of the whole narrative, in which the king alone is prominent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of</span> [Heb. to do the <span class="accented">judgment of</span>] <span class="cmt_word">his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the thing of a day in his day</span>.

What Solomon asks for in this prayer, is still granted in the intercession of Christ, of which his supplication was a type. We shall receive grace sufficient, suitable, and seasonable, in every time of need. No human heart is of itself willing to obey the gospel call to repentance, faith, and newness of life, walking in all the commandments of the Lord, yet Solomon exhorts the people to be perfect. This is the scriptural method, it is our duty to obey the command of the law and the call of the gospel, seeing we have broken the law. When our hearts are inclined thereto, feeling our sinfulness and weakness, we pray for Divine assistance; thus are we made able to serve God through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
