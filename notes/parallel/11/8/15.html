The record of that promise is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/7-5.htm" title="Go and tell my servant David, Thus said the LORD, Shall you build me an house for me to dwell in?">2Samuel 7:5-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/17-4.htm" title="Go and tell David my servant, Thus said the LORD, You shall not build me an house to dwell in:">1Chronicles 17:4-14</a>. Here it is freely cited with some variation, so far as it relates to the Temple. It is remarkable that in quoting it, David twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm" title="But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build an house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.">1Chronicles 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1Chronicles 28:3</a>) adds to it the instructive reason for the prohibition, that (unlike Solomon the Peaceful) he had "shed blood abundantly, and had made great wars." With much grace of filial piety, Solomon refrains from mention of that reason, though there seems to be some allusion to it in his words to Hiram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-3.htm" title="You know how that David my father could not build an house to the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.">1Kings 5:3</a>). On the other hand, he does add--what is not found in the earlier records--the declaration that, though David was not to build the Temple, "he did well that it was in his heart" to build it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-48.htm">1 Kings 1:48</a>], <span class="cmt_word">which spake with his mouth unto</span> [or, <span class="accented">concerning</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> after verbs of speaking has the force of de (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-16.htm">Jeremiah 40:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">David my father</span> [The words were really spoken to Nathan], <span class="cmt_word">and hath with his hand</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, power; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-28.htm">Acts 4:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-11.htm">Acts 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>] <span class="cmt_word">fulfilled it</span> [the spoken word He has fulfilled in deed], <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>, [The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, of which Solomon merely gives the substance.

The dark dispensations of Providence should quicken us in fleeing for refuge to the hope of the gospel. Nothing can more reconcile us to them, than to consider what God has said, and to compare his word and works together. Whatever good we do, we must look on it as the performance of God's promise to us, not of our promises to him.</body></html>
