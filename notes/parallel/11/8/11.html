for the cloud rested thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle." They shrank from the glory of the Lord, whom none could see and live; just as Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a>) felt "undone" when he beheld the glory of the Lord in the Temple; and as even the Apostles trembled, when they entered into "the bright cloud which overshadowed them" on the Mount of Transfiguration, and "knew not what they said" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.">Luke 9:33-34</a>). But it was not so much from terror of the Lord, who is "a consuming fire," as simply from awe and reverence of His unspeakable glory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So that the priests could not stand to rainwater because of the cloud</span> [They were overpowered by the manifestation, precisely as Moses had been before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>). It was at the moment when the singers and trumpeters, standing at the east end of the altar, began their service of praise - and the reappearance of the priests may well have been the signal for them to begin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>) - that "the house was filled with a cloud." Possibly the priests were about to burn incense. Evidently ministrations of some sort were intended and were interrupted. The exact correspondence with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>) is not to be overlooked. The idea obviously is that the Divine approval vouchsafed to the tabernacle was now in turn granted to the temple], <span class="cmt_word">for the glory of the Lord had</span> <span class="cmt_word">filled the house of the Lord.</span> [Is the "glory of the Lord" identical with the cloud, or is something additional intended by these words? It is certainly noticeable that what ver. 10 says of the cloud - that it "filled the house" - ver. 11 says of the glory. It is also true that there is no mention of any light or fire. And the "darkness" of ver. 12 might naturally seem to refer to the cloud, and therefore to exclude the idea of light. But surely the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;</span> are to be interpreted here by their signification and use elsewhere, and we find "the glory of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> elsewhere mentioned as something distinct from the cloud. We must remember that what by day was a pillar of cloud, by night was a pillar <span class="accented">of fire</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9, 16</a>, the mention of the "thick cloud" is followed by the statement that "Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it <span class="accented">in fire"</span> (ver. 18). Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>, we are told that "the glory of the Lord appeared upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it (the glory?) six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like <span class="accented">devouring fire</span> " (vers. 16, 17). But perhaps the most decisive passage in this connexion is <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>, where we are <span class="accented">told</span> that "the cloud abode <span class="accented">upon"</span> the tent of meeting, while "the glory of the Lord filled the (interior of the) tabernacle." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-7.htm">Exodus 16:7, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-6.htm">Leviticus 9:6, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19, 42</a>. It would appear, therefore, that "the glory of the Lord" was not the cloud, but, as the word almost seems to imply, a "light from heaven above the brightness of the sun" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-13.htm">Acts 26:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14, 16</a>). It is hardly necessary to add that the glory, though apparently resident in the cloud, was not always luminous; the cloud veiled it from the eyes of men. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 The bringing in the ark, is the end which must crown the work: this was done with great solemnity. The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2.
