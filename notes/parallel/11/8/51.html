<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm" title="I prayed therefore to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and your inheritance, which you have redeemed through your greatness, which you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>;

It implies the belief not only that the declared purpose of God cannot fail, but that, even for the manifestation of His glory to man, it must needs be visibly fulfilled before the eyes of the world. This same conviction breathes in many of the utterances of Moses for Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-12.htm" title="Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/14-13.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)">Numbers 14:13-14</a>); it is expressed in the "Help us, O Lord, and deliver us for Thy name's sake," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/79-9.htm" title="Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for your name's sake.">Psalm 79:9-10</a>, or the "Defer not for Thine own sake, O my God" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-19.htm" title="O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name.">Daniel 9:19</a> : it is declared on the part, of the Lord again and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-14.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.">Ezekiel 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-22.htm" title="Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.">Ezekiel 20:22</a>, "I wrought for my name's sake." It may, indeed, seem to jar upon our fuller conception of the infinite majesty of God, incapable of being augmented or lessened, and of the infinite love which does all for the sake of His creatures. Yet it is not wholly unlike our Lord's prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>), "Father, glorify thy name," or the Apostolic declarations of the great purpose of redemption, as designed for "the praise of God's glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>), and of all Christian life as commanded to "do all to the glory of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm" title="Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.">1Corinthians 10:31</a>). In some respects it is like the pleading with our Lord, in the Litanies of the Church in all ages, by all the various acts of His redemption, and the prayer of the old Latin hymn--<p>" Redemisti crucem passus;<p>Tantus labor ne sit cassus."<p>But, indeed, all that might seem to us strange or unworthy in such prayers vanishes at once, when we consider that the knowledge of God in His self-manifestation is the highest happiness of man; on which, indeed, depend all depth and harmony of human knowledge, and all dignity and purity of human life. Hence, in the Lord's Prayer, the three petitions "for Gods glory," preceding all special petitions for our own needs, are really prayers for the highest blessing of all mankind. God's care for His glory is not for His own sake, but for ours.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they be thy people</span> [a citation or reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt</span> [cf. vers. 21, 53. There is a constant recurrence throughout the Old Testament to this great deliverance, and with good reason, for it was the real birthday of the nation, and was also a pledge of future help and favour. God who had "wrought such great things for them in Egypt "could not well forsake them. Solomon's constant plea is that they are the elect and covenant race] <span class="cmt_word">from the midst of the furnace of iron</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a furnace for iron, heated and fierce as for smelting. Same phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-53 In this excellent prayer, Solomon does as we should do in every prayer; he gives glory to God. Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promises call for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. The experiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourage us to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those who expect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God's promises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the whole service of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices, oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually to be remembered. Under one word, forgive, Solomon expressed all that he could ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin, forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, and the receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove a blessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomon entreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, even by their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his own heart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands in prayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. These drive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands in prayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the general request, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now, under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. The substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us. In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, the backslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger is brought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified. Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness lead to all human happiness.</body></html>
