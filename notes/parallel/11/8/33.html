It pictures various national calamities, and in each recognises not mere evils, but chastisements of God, who desires by them to teach, and is most ready to forgive. First it naturally dwells on disaster in battle, which, in the whole history of the Exodus, of the Conquest, of the troubled age of the Judges, and of the reigns of Saul and David, is acknowledged as a sign of unfaithfulness in Israel, either through sin or through idolatry, to the covenant of God, on which the victorious possession of the promised land depended. On that history the blessing and the curse of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-17.htm" title="And I will set my face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.">Leviticus 26:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-32.htm" title="And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.">Leviticus 26:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm" title="The LORD shall cause you to be smitten before your enemies: you shall go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shall be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>) form a commentary of emphatic warning, and the Psalms again and again bring the same lesson home (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/44-1.htm" title="We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the times of old.">Psalm 44:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/44-9.htm" title="But you have cast off, and put us to shame; and go not forth with our armies.">Psalm 44:9-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/60-9.htm" title="Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?">Psalm 60:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/89-42.htm" title="You have set up the right hand of his adversaries; you have made all his enemies to rejoice.">Psalm 89:42-46</a>). With characteristic seriousness, Solomon looks back from his peaceful prosperity on the stormy past, and from it learns to pray for the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy</span> [cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>.

But the king obviously is speaking here, not of those taken captive, but of the nation at large ("thy people Israel") by its representatives (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>), supplicating after its defeat. The idea of captives does not come in until the next verse. Under the term house the courts are obviously included (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-10.htm">Luke 18:10</a>). Into the edifice the priests alone were admitted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-53 In this excellent prayer, Solomon does as we should do in every prayer; he gives glory to God. Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promises call for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. The experiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourage us to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those who expect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God's promises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the whole service of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices, oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually to be remembered. Under one word, forgive, Solomon expressed all that he could ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin, forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, and the receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove a blessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomon entreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, even by their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his own heart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands in prayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. These drive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands in prayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the general request, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now, under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. The substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us. In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, the backslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger is brought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified. Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness lead to all human happiness.</body></html>
