although, as the narrative remarks with characteristic minuteness of accuracy, "not without" from the porch. The reason why this detail is dwelt upon is obvious. Up to this time it had been forbidden to withdraw the staves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-13.htm" title="And you shall make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.">Exodus 25:13-15</a>), so that the ark might always be ready for transference; now the withdrawal marked the entrance on a new period, during which it was to rest unmoved.<p><span class= "bld">There they are unto this day.</span>--This phrase--not unfrequently repeated in the narrative (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-21.htm" title="Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, on those did Solomon levy a tribute of slavery to this day.">1Kings 9:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-12.htm" title="And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen to this day.">1Kings 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-19.htm" title="So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.">1Kings 12:19</a>, &c.)--is an interesting indication of quotation from older documents; for at the time of the compilation of the book the Temple and all that it contained had been destroyed or removed. It is remarkable that in the record of the successive spoilings of the Temple by the Chaldaeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm" title="And he carried out there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.">2Kings 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2Kings 25:13-17</a>), while the various vessels, the brazen pillars, and the sea are mentioned in detail, nothing is said of their carrying away the ark, which would have been the choicest, as most sacred, of all the spoils. (See Notes on these passages.) About the Jewish tradition, referred to above (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm" title="And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.">1Kings 8:4</a>), setting aside the supposed miracle, there is no intrinsic improbability, considering the respect paid to Jeremiah by the Chaldaeans. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/39-11.htm" title="Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,">Jeremiah 39:11-14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant unto his</span> [<span class="accented">i.e., its</span>.

This word is of some importance as showing that the ark would thenceforward and always be in complete darkness, under the outstretched wings of the cherubim - a fact which suggests the true explanation of the following verse] <span class="cmt_word">the ark and the staves thereof above</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">from above</span>]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 The bringing in the ark, is the end which must crown the work: this was done with great solemnity. The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison with the sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the Divine glory is unveiled.</body></html>
