for it was the main entrance to Palestine from the north, down which the hosts of Assyria and Babylon so constantly poured. Evidently it extended at this time beyond Damascus.<p><span class= "bld">The river of Egypt </span>is not, as might naturally be thought, the Nile, or any of its branches; for the word used signifies rather a "brook" or "torrent," and the torrent, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm" title="And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.">Numbers 34:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-4.htm" title="From there it passed toward Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.">Joshua 15:4</a> as the border of Israel, is identified by all authorities with the torrent falling into the sea at El-Arish.<p>(65, 66) <span class= "bld">Seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.

Hence it is clear that the festival week of the Dedication preceded the regular feast; and the day of dismissal was the "eighth day," regularly so-called, of the close of the Feast of Tabernacles.<p><span class= "bld">Unto their tents.</span>--The old memory of the wandering life of Israel still lingers in this expression, as in the well-known phrase "To your tents, O Israel!"
