and the priests and Levites had hitherto been divided between it and the lesser tabernacle over the ark on Mount Zion. Probably each section of the priests and Levites now brought up in solemn procession the sacred things entrusted to them. According to the order of the Mosaic law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/3-25.htm" title="And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 3:25-37</a>), the Kohathites had charge on the march of the ark and the vessels, the Gershonites of the Tabernacle and its hangings, and the Merarites of the boards and pillars of the Tabernacle and the outer court. This order, no doubt, was followed, as far as possible, on this its last journey. What became of the Tabernacle and its furniture (so far as this was disused), we are not told; but all was probably deposited, as a sacred relic of antiquity, somewhere in the precincts of the Temple. This seems to be implied in the famous Jewish tradition (see <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-4.htm" title="It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God.">2 Maccabees 2:4-6</a>), that Jeremiah was enabled to hide by miracle "the Tabernacle and the ark and the altar of incense" on the destruction of the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they brought up the ark of the Lord</span> [which had now been for nearly 40 years "in the tabernacle that David had pitched for it" on the Mount Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>) ], <span class="cmt_word">and the tabernacle of the congregation</span> [Heb, "the tabernacle of <span class="accented">meeting"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42, 46</a>. See Dict. Bib. 2. p. 1414; Bahr, Symbolik, 1:80, 81). This had been for many years at Gibeon. (Cf. ch. 3:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-8.htm">2 Chronicles 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>. See note on ch. 3:4.) The tabernacle of Mount Zion is never called "the tabernacle of the congregation" - indeed, it is expressly dis-tingnished from it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3, 4</a>. The ark and the tabernacle were now reunited in the temple of Solomon, thus "marking the identity and continuity of the life and ritual of the Hebrew Church" (Wordsworth) ], <span class="cmt_word">and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle</span> [Perhaps the brazen altar. <span class="accented">Certainly</span> the altar of incense, the table of shewbread, the candlestick, and also the <span class="accented">brazen serpent</span> (Stanley) ], <span class="cmt_word">even those did the priests and Levites bring up.</span> [<span class="cmt_word">We</span> are hardly justified in saying (as Keil, <span class="accented">al</span>.) that the Levites carried all but the ark. The text rather favours the view that the priests assisted in bringing up the tabernacle and its furniture. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-5.htm">2 Chronicles 5:5</a>. Neither the tabernacle nor its vessels were designed for further use in the temple; the latter had been replaced by vessels better suited to the enlarged sanctuary - they were simply preserved, so far as we know, as relics of the past. in the treasury or side chambers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 The bringing in the ark, is the end which must crown the work: this was done with great solemnity. The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison with the sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the Divine glory is unveiled.</body></html>
