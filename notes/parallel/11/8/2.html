The name is supposed (by Thenius) to be properly, as in the LXX., <span class= "ital">Athanim</span>, and to signify the "month of gifts," so called as bringing with it the gathering in of the vintage, and of the last of the crops. According to the Chaldee Targum, it was in old times the beginning of the civil, as Abib of the ecclesiastical year. The feast in this month was the Feast of Tabernacles--of all feasts of the year the most joyful--marking the gathering in of all the fruits of the land, commemorating the dwelling in tabernacles in the wilderness, and thanking God for settlement and blessing in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-33.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 23:33-44</a>). It was, perhaps, the time when the Israelites could best be absent from their lands for a prolonged festival; but there was also a peculiar appropriateness in thus giving it a higher consecration, by celebrating on it the transference of the ark from the movable tabernacle to a fixed and splendid habitation. In this instance the festival was doubled in duration, from seven to fourteen days. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm" title="And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.">1Kings 8:65</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the men of Israel</span> [not all the heads of the tribes just mentioned (ver. 1), as Keil, but all who came to the feast, as every male Israelite was under obligation to do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>) ] <span class="cmt_word">assembled</span> <span class="cmt_word">themselves</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto King Solomon at the feast</span> [the Heb. word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;</span> (with the art.) always means the feast of tabernacles. The same word is used of the feast of passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>) and pentecost (<span class="accented">ib</span>. ver. 16), but "the feast" here can only mean that of tabernacles. As the "feast of ingathering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), as commemorating the deliverance from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>), and as peculiarly a social festival (<span class="accented">ib</span>. vers. 40-42; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a> sqq.), it was the most joyous as well as the greatest (?Jos., Ant. 8:04. 1) gathering of the year. (Compare the Jewish saying of a later date: "He who has never seen the rejoicing at the pouring out of the water of Siloam, has never seen rejoicing in his life.") It was doubtless for this reason that tabernacles was selected for the dedication. A special feast of dedication, however, was held for seven days before the feast of tabernacles proper commenced (see on ver. 65). It did not displace that great feast, however (Stanley), but simply preceded it. It is worthy of notice that Jeroboam selected the same feast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm">1 Kings 12:32</a>) for the inauguration of his new cultus. The idea of Josephus, that the feast of tabernacles "happened to coincide with the dedication" hardly seems probable] <span class="cmt_word">in the month Ethanim</span> [variously interpreted to mean <span class="accented">gifts, i.e., fruits</span> (Thenius), <span class="accented">flowing streams</span> (Gesenius) - it falls about the time of the early rains - and <span class="accented">equinox</span> (Bottcher) ], <span class="cmt_word">which is the seventh month.</span> [This is added because the month was subsequently known as Tisri (see on 1 Kings 6:1), or to show that "the feast" was the feast of tabernacles.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 The bringing in the ark, is the end which must crown the work: this was done with great solemnity. The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison with the sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the Divine glory is unveiled.</body></html>
