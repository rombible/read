Confidently as Solomon believes that he has built a habitation for the Lord, he never dreams that the "Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>) ]: <span class="cmt_word">and when thou hearest,</span> forgive.

With the next verse the special or particular supplications begin. Like those of the Lord's prayer, they are seven in number, and no doubt for the same reason, viz., because seven was the number of covenant, the number which expressed the relationship between the Lord and His people ("<span class="accented">die Signatur der Verbindung Gottes und der Welt"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> Bahr, Symbolik, 1:187 sqq.) In fact, to the Jew the number "seven" was something like the sign of the cross to a large portion of Catholic Christendom, for it spoke to him of God's covenant of mercy and peace. And the first of the seven concerns <span class="accented">oaths</span>. The king implores the covenant-keeping God to watch over the covenants of words made in the now consecrated sanctuary, and to protect their sanctity by punishing the false swearer. There were cases in which the Mosaic law provided that an oath should be administered to suspected persons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1, 4</a>, etc.) And there were other cases in which men of their own accord, for "an end of all strife," would make oath. Now every oath, whatever its form (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16-22</a>), is in reality an affirmation" by the God of truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>); it is an appeal to the knowledge and power and justice of the Most High (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>). A false oath, consequently, dishonoured the Divine name, and polluted the sanctuary dedicated to that name, and if it went unpunished, contradicted the principles and provisions of the dispensation Of temporal punishments, and so encouraged falsehood and impiety. God is here entreated, consequently, to take cognizance of the oaths sworn before His altar (ver. 31), and to be a swift witness against the false swearers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>). It is, perhaps, because of the direct dishonour which perjury offers to the Divine name that, as Bahr suggests, this prayer stands first among the seven, thus corresponding to the "Hallowed be Thy name" in the Lord's prayer, and to the third among the ten commandments. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-53 In this excellent prayer, Solomon does as we should do in every prayer; he gives glory to God. Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promises call for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. The experiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourage us to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those who expect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God's promises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the whole service of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices, oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually to be remembered. Under one word, forgive, Solomon expressed all that he could ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin, forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, and the receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove a blessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomon entreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, even by their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his own heart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands in prayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. These drive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands in prayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the general request, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now, under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. The substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us. In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, the backslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger is brought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified. Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness lead to all human happiness.</body></html>
