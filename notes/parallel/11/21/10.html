It properly signifies "to bless;" thence, to "part from with blessing;" finally to part from, or "disown." It is, rather, therefore, "to renounce" than "to blaspheme."

This use of the word "son" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-22.htm">Psalm 89:22</a>, "son of wickedness"), which is one of the commonest idioms of the East, throws some light on the expression "sons of the prophets" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>, note; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">before him</span> [confronting him], <span class="cmt_word">to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bless</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The Lexicographers are not agreed as to how this word, the primary meaning of which is to <span class="accented">kneel</span>, hence to <span class="accented">pray</span>, to <span class="accented">bless</span>, came to signify <span class="accented">curse</span> or <span class="accented">blaspheme</span>. According to some, it is an euphemism, the idea of cursing God being altogether too horrible for the Jew to express in words; whilst others derive this signification from the fact that a curse is really a <span class="accented">prayer</span> addressed to God; and others, again, account for it by the consideration that a person who <span class="accented">bids</span> <span class="accented">farewell</span> to another sometimes does so in the sense of dismissing and cursing him.

Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.</body></html>
