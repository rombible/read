See note on 1 Kings 20:39. Whatever Ahab's moral weakness, he was certainly a prince of some enterprize. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a> speaks of the "cities "which he built. And the palace of Jezreel would seem to have been erected by him. This vineyard was to be one of his improvements.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-4 Naboth, perhaps, had been pleased that he had a vineyard situated so near the palace, but the situation proved fatal to him; many a man's possessions have been his snare, and his neighbourhood to greatness, of bad consequence. Discontent is a sin that is its own punishment, and makes men torment themselves. It is a sin that is its own parent; it arises not from the condition, but from the mind: as we find Paul contented in a prison, so Ahab was discontented in a palace. He had all the delights of Canaan, that pleasant land, at command; the wealth of a kingdom, the pleasures of a court, and the honours and powers of a throne; yet all avails him nothing without Naboth's vineyard. Wrong desires expose men to continual vexations, and those that are disposed to fret, however well off, may always find something or other to fret at.</body></html>
