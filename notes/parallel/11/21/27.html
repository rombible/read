the meaning is variously conjectured. The LXX. (in some MSS.) has "bent down" in sorrow; the Vulgate similarly "with head bent down;" the Eastern versions and Josephus, "barefooted," which seems far the most probable meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">these</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>words</span> [vers. 21-24, and others not recorded], <span class="cmt_word">that he rent his clothes</span> [cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-24.htm">Jeremiah 36:24</a>, etc.], <span class="cmt_word">and put sackcloth</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon his flesh</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-31.htm">1 Kings 20:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>, Heb.]<span class="cmt_word">, and fasted, and lay</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, slept] <span class="cmt_word">in sackcloth, and went softly.</span> [All these were signs of contrition and humiliation (ver. 29).

Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.</body></html>
