and they stand as a garment.">Job 38:14</a>) on a lump of clay attached to the letter. The sealing (as the modern sense of "signature" implies) was the pledge of authenticity and authority. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-18.htm" title="And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave it her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.">Genesis 38:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-38.htm" title="And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal to it.">Nehemiah 9:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-1.htm" title="Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,">Nehemiah 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-10.htm" title="And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.">Esther 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-12.htm" title="Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.">Esther 3:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-17.htm" title="And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.">Daniel 6:17</a>, &c.) The use of the seal--ordinarily worn or carried on the person--implies Ahab's knowledge that something is being done in his name, into which he takes care not to inquire.<p><span class= "bld">In his city.</span>--This would be most naturally interpreted as Jezreel; but if Naboth dwelt or sojourned at Samaria, it may be Samaria. Jezebel naturally desires that neither Ahab nor she herself, though close at hand, should appear in the matter; but gives the necessary authority in writing, because without it the deed could not be done.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So she wrote letters</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">writings</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal</span> [The use of the seal, for the purpose of authentication, is of great antiquity. Some of the Egyptian signets are more than 4,000 years old. Their use in the age of the patriarchs is attested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-15.htm">Genesis 38:15</a> and Genesis 41:42; their importance is proved by the text, by <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-10.htm">Esther 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-2.htm">Esther 8:2, 8, 10</a> (cf.

The use of Ahab's seal affords a strong presumption that he was privy to her designs (Bahr), but of this we cannot be absolutely certain], <span class="cmt_word">and sent the letters unto the elders</span> [see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>] <span class="cmt_word">and to the nobles</span> [same word <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a>] <span class="cmt_word">that were in his city, dwelling</span> [or <span class="accented">inhabitants, as in</span> ver. 11] <span class="cmt_word">with Naboth.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:5-16 When, instead of a help meet, a man has an agent for Satan, in the form of an artful, unprincipled, yet beloved wife, fatal effects may be expected. Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.</body></html>
