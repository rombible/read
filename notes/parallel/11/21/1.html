and all the prophets prophesied before them.">1Kings 22:10</a>--apparently near the palace of Ahab in Samaria, not in Jezreel. The Vulgate renders "who was" instead of "which was" in Jezreel. The question of the position of the vineyard, apparently the scene of Naboth's murder, is difficult. The "plot of ground" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25-26</a>--not, however, called "a vineyard"--is clearly at Jezreel. where, as a native of the place, Naboth would be likely to hold land. But the vineyard may have been an outlying property near Samaria, which Ahab might naturally suppose Naboth, even for that re<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm" title="And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.">1Kings 21:19</a>, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm" title="And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.">1Kings 22:38</a> is declared to have been fulfilled at the pool of Samaria. Moreover, the whole action of the chapter, as far as Ahab is concerned, seems to have been at Samaria; and, indeed, if we take <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-18.htm" title="Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.">1Kings 21:18</a> literally, this is actually declared to be the case. On the other side, however, we have the reading of the text, the more obvious interpretation of the words "his city" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm" title="So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.">1Kings 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-11.htm" title="And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.">1Kings 21:11</a>; and the reference to the prophecy of Elijah, in connection with the casting of the body of Jehoram into the plot of ground at Jezreel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25-26</a>). It is, perhaps, impossible to clear up the discrepancy entirely with our present knowledge.<p>(2?4) <span class= "bld">And Ahab spake.</span>--The whole history is singularly true to nature. At first, as the desire of Ahab was natural, so his offer was courteous and liberal. The refusal of Naboth--evidently grounded on the illegality, as well as the natural dislike, of alienation of "the inheritance of his fathers" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-13.htm" title="In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.">Leviticus 25:13-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-7.htm" title="So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.">Numbers 36:7</a>), and therefore not only allowable, but right--has nevertheless about it a certain tone of harshness, perhaps of unnecessary discourtesy, implying condemnation, as well as rejection, of the offer of the king. It is characteristic of the weak and petulant nature of Ahab, that he neither recognises the legality and justice of Naboth's action, nor dares to resent the curt defiance of his refusal. Like a spoilt child, he comes back sullen and angry, throws himself on his bed, and will eat no bread. All that he has is as nothing, while the little plot of ground is refused; as to Haman all was worthless, while Mordecai the Jew sat in the king's gate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-13.htm" title="Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.">Esther 5:13</a>). This temper of sullen, childish discontent is the natural seedplot of crime, under the instigation of more determined wickedness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass after these things</span> [These words are omitted in the Vat.

Stanley (Dict.

Discontent is a sin that is its own punishment, and makes men torment themselves. It is a sin that is its own parent; it arises not from the condition, but from the mind: as we find Paul contented in a prison, so Ahab was discontented in a palace. He had all the delights of Canaan, that pleasant land, at command; the wealth of a kingdom, the pleasures of a court, and the honours and powers of a throne; yet all avails him nothing without Naboth's vineyard. Wrong desires expose men to continual vexations, and those that are disposed to fret, however well off, may always find something or other to fret at.</body></html>
