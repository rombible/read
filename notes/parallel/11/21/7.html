First comes the bitter irony of the question, "Dost thou govern the kingdom of Israel, and yet suffer a subject to cross thy will?" expressing her scornful wonder at one who "lets I dare not, wait upon 1 would." Then in the invitation, "eat bread, and let thine heart be merry," there seems the same half-contemptuous recognition of a self-indulgent weakness of nature, which may be traced in Elijah's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-41.htm" title="And Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.">1Kings 18:41</a>, "Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain." Ahab is fit only to desire and to revel; it is for bolder spirits to act for good or for evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jezebel his wife said unto him.

The commentators generally, however, understand the words - as the LXX. and the A.V. - as an ironical question, "Art thou ruler in aught but name?" though some take it as an imperative: "Do thou now exert authority over the kingdom of Israel," And on the whole, this latter interpretation appears to be preferable. "Do thou now play the king. Make thy power felt. Give me the requisite authority.

Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.</body></html>
