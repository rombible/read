[Heb. <span class="accented">even thou</span>. The LXX. adds, "And the harlots shall bathe in thy blood." For the construction see Gesen., Gram. &sect; 119. 3; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-34.htm">Genesis 27:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>. Thenius contends that there is a contradiction between this ver. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a> (together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>) which is absolutely insuperable. But as Bahr observes, "How thoughtless our author must have been if in two consecutive chapters - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the same leaf, as it were - he had inadvertently inserted direct contradictions." And the following considerations will show that the discrepancy is only apparent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The sentence here pronounced against Ahab was, on his repentance, stayed in its execution. God said distinctly, "I will not bring the evil in his days," and as distinctly added that He would "bring the evil in his <span class="accented">son's days, upon his house"</span> (ver. 29). And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with the prophecy, as thus modified, the facts exactly record. The body of Jehoram was "cast into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite" (2 Kings <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). And if it be objected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that our historian sees in the death of Ahab <span class="accented">in Samaria</span> (ch. 20. <span class="accented">l.c.</span>) a fulfilment of this prophecy, the answer is that that death was a <span class="accented">partial</span> fulfilment of Elijah's words. The repentance of Ahab, having secured him immunity from this sentence, his subsequent folly and sin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>) nevertheless brought down upon him a judgment of God strikingly similar, as we might expect it would be, to that originally denounced against him, which was now reserved for his son. In ether words, the prophecy was fulfilled to the letter in the person of his son, but it had a secondary fulfilment in its spirit on himself]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:17-29 Blessed Paul complains that he was sold under sin, Ro 7:14, as a poor captive against his will; but Ahab was willing, he sold himself to sin; of choice, and as his own act and deed, he loved the dominion of sin. Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.</body></html>
