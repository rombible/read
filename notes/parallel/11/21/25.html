Ahab stands revealed as the true culprit before God, without a shred of subterfuge to veil his ultimate responsibility. Now, briefly and sternly, the prophet notices the bolder criminal, pronouncing against her a doom of shame and horror, seldom falling upon a woman, but rightly visiting one who had forsworn the pity and modesty of her sex. In the "ditch" (see margin) outside the walls, where the refuse of the city gathers the half-wild dogs--the scavengers of Eastern cities--her dead body is to be thrown as offal, and to be torn and devoured.<p>This verse and the next are evidently the reflection of the compiler, catching its inspiration from the words of Elijah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm" title="And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy?

Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.</body></html>
