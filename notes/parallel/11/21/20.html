Ahab, having no word of defence to utter, endeavours to attribute Elijah's rebuke and condemnation to simple enmity, much as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Are you he that troubles Israel?">1Kings 18:17</a> he cries out "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?" The crushing answer is that the prophet came not because he was an enemy, but because Ahab had "sold himself"--had become a slave instead of a king--under the lust of desire and the temptation of Jezebel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me</span> [Not merely, "Hast thou found me out? hast thou surprised me in the very act?" though this meaning is not to be excluded, but also, "Has thy vengeance overtaken me?" <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;</span> is used in this sense <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a>. Ahab is so conscience stricken by the sudden apparition of Elijah, whom in all probability he had not seen or heard of since "the day of Carmel," and by his appearance on the scene at the very moment when he was entering on the fruit of his misdoing," in the very blossom of his sin," that he feels that judgment is already begun], <span class="cmt_word">O</span> <span class="cmt_word">mine enemy?</span> [No doubt the thought was present in Ahab's mind that Elijah had ever been opposed to him and thwarting him, but he does not dream (Von Gerlach, in Bahr) of justifying himself by ascribing Elijah's intervention to personal hatred towards himself. The sequel shows that he was thoroughly conscious of wrong-doing.] <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, I have found thee: because</span> [not because I am thine enemy, but because] <span class="cmt_word">thou has sold thyself</span> [or <span class="accented">sellest thyself, i.e.</span>, surrenderest thyself wholly. The idea is clearly derived from the institutions of slavery, according to which the bondservant was wholly at his master's disposal and was bound to accomplish his will. Whether "the practice of men selling themselves into slavery" (Rawlinson) existed in that age may perhaps be doubted. We have the same thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>] <span class="cmt_word">to work evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> [We can readily gather from these words why the doom was denounced against Ahab, who had but a secondary share in the crime, rather than against Jezebel, its real perpetrator. It was because Ahab was the representative of God, God's minister of justice, etc. If he had not himself devised the death of Naboth; if he had, which is possible, remained in ignorance of the means by which Jezebel proposed to procure him the vineyard, he had nevertheless readily and gladly acquiesced in her infamous crime after its accomplishment, and was then reaping its fruits. And because he was the king, the judge, who, instead of punishing the evil doer, sanctioned and approved the deed, and who crowned a reign of idolatries and abominations with this shameful murder, the prophetic sentence is directed primarily against him.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:17-29 Blessed Paul complains that he was sold under sin, Ro 7:14, as a poor captive against his will; but Ahab was willing, he sold himself to sin; of choice, and as his own act and deed, he loved the dominion of sin. Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.</body></html>
