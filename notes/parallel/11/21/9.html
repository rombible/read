Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">and set Naboth on high among the people.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">at the head of the people</span>.

But "at the <span class="accented">head</span> of the people "rather suggests that in the public assembly, which marked the fast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a>), Naboth was assigned the most distinguished place. The reason for this is obvious, viz., to give a colour of impartiality to the proceedings. As Grotius, <span class="accented">Ne odio damnasse crederentur, quem ipsi honoraverunt</span>. It would also accord with the popular idea of retributive justice that Naboth should be denounced in the very hour of his triumph and exaltation. Josephus, however, says that it was because of his high birth that this position was assigned him.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:5-16 When, instead of a help meet, a man has an agent for Satan, in the form of an artful, unprincipled, yet beloved wife, fatal effects may be expected. Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.</body></html>
