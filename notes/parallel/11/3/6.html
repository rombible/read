Here it is clear that the wisdom which he asks is that of the ruler, involving elements both moral and intellectual--the wisdom to discern and do true justice between man and man. He calls himself "a little child"--his age is variously estimated from twelve to twenty at this time--and trembles at the responsibility of ruling over "so great a people." But, in the characteristic spirit of the true godliness of the Old Testament, he looks for wisdom, not as the mere result of human teaching and experience, but as an inspiration of God, and prays for it accordingly, in a prayer of singular beauty and humility, pleading simply God's promise to his father, and its fulfilment in his own accession to the throne.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">wrought with</span>] <span class="cmt_word">thy servant David my father great mercy</span> [marg., <span class="accented">favour</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>according as he walked Before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee</span> [cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-3.htm">2 Kings 20:3</a>, where Hezekiah uses much the same language of himself.

While his bodily powers were locked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he was enabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice. God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuring us we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such a choice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed it came from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants and weakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise and considerate men are, the better acquainted they are with their own weakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God to give him wisdom. We must pray for it, Jas 1:5, that it may help us in our particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those are accepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It was a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave him wisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gave him riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will bring outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The way to get spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them. The way to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to God concerning them. Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it, and wealth, because he did not.</body></html>
