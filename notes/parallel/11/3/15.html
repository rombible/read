The same words are used of Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-7.htm">Genesis 41:7</a>) when God showed him what He was about to do (vers. 25, 28, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>), and this was such a dream as Pharaoh's and as Joseph's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-19.htm">Matthew 2:19</a>). It was a dream, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in which a Divine revelation was made to him. Wordsw. refers to Solomon's words, "I sleep, but my <span class="accented">heart waketh"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-2.htm">Song of Solomon 5:2</a>), and "He giveth to his beloved (Jedidiah) in sleep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>)]. <span class="cmt_word">And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant</span> [the other sanctuary of that period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-37.htm">1 Chronicles 16:37-40</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">and offered up burnt offerings</span> [probably in continuation of the sacrifices of Gibeon, ver. 4], <span class="cmt_word">and offered peace offerings</span> [in testimony of his thankfulness for the signal favour recently vouchsafed to him] <span class="cmt_word">and made a feast</span> [lit., a <span class="accented">drinking.</span> After the example of David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-3.htm">1 Chronicles 16:3</a>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>. It was not exclusively <span class="accented">a symposium.</span> The flesh of the animals offered in sacrifice was eaten by the worshippers and their guests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>).

IN this section we see how remarkably the gracious promise of Gibeon (ver. 12) was fulfilled. The "understanding to discern judgment" has been richly bestowed. And this, no doubt, is the reason why the story is related here. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (Theodoret). It is just possible, as Thenius maintains, that the narrative was handed down to a succeeding age by tradition, and was not incorporated into any of the documents from which our historian compiled his narrative; but this argues nothing against its authenticity or its inspiration. It is, as Bahr observes, a thoroughly Oriental story. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-15 Solomon's dream was not a common one. While his bodily powers were locked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he was enabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice. God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuring us we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such a choice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed it came from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants and weakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise and considerate men are, the better acquainted they are with their own weakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God to give him wisdom. We must pray for it, Jas 1:5, that it may help us in our particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those are accepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It was a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave him wisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gave him riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will bring outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The way to get spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them. The way to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to God concerning them. Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it, and wealth, because he did not.</body></html>
