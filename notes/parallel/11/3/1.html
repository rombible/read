This, and a corresponding abeyance (judging from the monuments) of Assyrian power, gave scope for the rise to sudden greatness and wealth of the Israelite kingdom under Solomon, and probably induced the Egyptian king of those days to consent to an alliance which, at other times, the greatness of the Pharaohs might have spumed. No fault is found with the alliance by the sacred historian, for the Egyptians were never looked upon with the same aversion as the strange women of the Canaanite races. As, moreover, it is not in any way connected with Solomon's subsequent declension into idolatry, noticed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:">1Kings 11:1-8</a>, it is not unlikely that the new queen literally acted on the call of the Psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-10.htm" title="Listen, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people, and your father's house;">Psalm 45:10</a>) to "forget her own people and her father's house."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon made affinit</span>y [Not "alliance" (as some have supposed) but relationship. Lit., <span class="accented">made himself son-in-law</span>] with <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh king of Egypt</span> [which of the Pharaohs this was, it is impossible to say with certainty. As, however, Shishak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25</a>) is undoubtedly the Sheshonk who succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the 26th year of Solomon (Poole), and who was the first king of the 22nd dynasty of Manetho, we may safely identify this Pharaoh with "a late king of the 21st (or Janite) dynasty." It has been assumed (Bunsen, Ewald, Brugsch, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that it was Psusennes II., the last king of that house, on the supposition that he reigned 35 years, (as stated by Eusebius), but according to Africanus, his reign was limited to 14 years. It is wiser to say, therefore, with Mr. Poole (Dict. Bib., "Pharaoh") that this Pharaoh "cannot yet be identified on Manetho's list." It is also impossible to decide whether the alliance was first sought by Solomon with a view to win over a powerful and dangerous neighbour (Thenius), to whose inroads his northern border was exposed, and especially to counteract the influence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-21.htm">1 Kings 11:21</a>) of Hadad (Plumptre), or whether the marriage was proposed by Pharaoh because the 21st dynasty "had then become very weak" (Rawlinson) and its head desired "friendly relations with the kingdom of Israel, which had grown into a power to be dreaded" (Keil). But we may reasonably suppose that the alliance "must have been to most Israelites a very startling one" (Plumptre.) Egypt (Rahab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>) was to every Israelite a name both of triumph and dread.

"At the same time, it was only when the foreign wives renounced idolatry, that such marriages were in accordance with the spirit of the law" (Keil). As Solomon at this period of his life faithfully observed the law, as he is never blamed for this marriage, and as there is no trace whatever of the introduction of Egyptian rites into Israel, it is a fair presumption that the Egyptian princess conformed to the religion of her adopted country], <span class="cmt_word">and brought her into the city of David</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a> speaks of her dwelling in "the <span class="accented">house</span> of David," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, it would seem, the palace which David had occupied] <span class="cmt_word">until he had made an end</span> [this hardly shows that he had begun to build, as Keil infers.

David had fortified a part of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 He that loved the Lord, should, for his sake, have fixed his love upon one of the Lord's people. Solomon was a wise man, a rich man, a great man; yet the brightest praise of him, is that which is the character of all the saints, even the poorest, He loved the Lord. Where God sows plentifully, he expects to reap accordingly; and those that truly love God and his worship, will not grudge the expenses of their religion. We must never think that wasted which is laid out in the service of God.</body></html>
