and I am but</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and I</span>... ] <span class="cmt_word">a little child:</span> [These words are generally understood as indicating Solomon's humility rather than his age. No doubt, there is some exaggeration in the expression, which manifestly is not to be taken <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre</span>; at the same time it is questionable whether such words would be used of himself by a young man of twenty, which Solomon is commonly supposed to have been.

Also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-25.htm">2 Samuel 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>. It is the formula for expressing behaviour, conduct, the outward life of man.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-15 Solomon's dream was not a common one. While his bodily powers were locked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he was enabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice. God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuring us we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such a choice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed it came from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants and weakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise and considerate men are, the better acquainted they are with their own weakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God to give him wisdom. We must pray for it, Jas 1:5, that it may help us in our particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those are accepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It was a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave him wisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gave him riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will bring outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The way to get spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them. The way to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to God concerning them. Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it, and wealth, because he did not.</body></html>
