"to <span class="accented">hear</span> judgment.") The idea is not docility, as the Vulg. (<span class="accented">cor docile</span>), but discrimination, penetration. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-17.htm">2 Samuel 14:17</a> (Heb.); <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9, 10</a> (marg.)] <span class="cmt_word">heart</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a judicial mind.

The Jews desired a king that he might <span class="accented">judge</span> them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). Their rulers so far had been purely "Judges" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>; compare the Carthaginian name, <span class="accented">suffetes.</span>) When they desired one who should, lead their armies, they still put his judicial functions in the first place (<span class="accented">loc</span>. <span class="accented">cit.</span> ver. 20). And what were the duties of a king in this respect, Absalom's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>) show.

While his bodily powers were locked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he was enabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice. God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuring us we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such a choice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed it came from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants and weakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise and considerate men are, the better acquainted they are with their own weakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God to give him wisdom. We must pray for it, Jas 1:5, that it may help us in our particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those are accepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It was a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave him wisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gave him riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will bring outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The way to get spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them. The way to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to God concerning them. Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it, and wealth, because he did not.</body></html>
