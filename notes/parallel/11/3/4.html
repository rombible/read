Now known as <span class="accented">El-Jib</span>, a commanding eminence (as the name implies) some six miles north of Jerusalem. Strictly, it consists of <span class="accented">two</span> heights, on one of which, it is conjectured, the town stood, while the other was the high place. Solomon was accompanied to Gibeon by "all the congregation," including the captains, judges, governors, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-2.htm">2 Chronicles 1:2, 3</a>] <span class="cmt_word">to sacrifice there</span> [This religious service was designed to inaugurate his reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a>), after the precedent of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>. His object was also to supplicate the Divine blessing on his undertakings. If his visit served at the same time as a farewell, or "honourable funeral to the tabernacle" (Wordsw.) this was an accident]; <span class="cmt_word">for that was the great high place</span> [being the place of the tabernacle and brazen altar. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a> we find the tabernacle at Nob, though without the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-2.htm">1 Samuel 4:2</a>). After the massacre of the priests it lost the ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>). It could hardly remain in a spot stained by so much blood; but how or when it found its way to Gibeon, we do not know. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-37.htm">1 Chronicles 16:37, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3-6</a>]: <span class="cmt_word">a thousand burnt offerings</span> [such numbers were not infrequent at festivals. See on 1 Kings 8:62, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-33.htm">2 Chronicles 29:33, 34</a>. Rawlinson reminds us that "Xerxes offered 1000 oxen at Troy" (Herod. 7:43).] <span class="cmt_word">did Solomon offer</span> [not, of course, personally, as some (Ewald. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>) have sup. posed. He is said to have "offered" them, because he (together with the congregation, perhaps) provided them. The immense number alone shows that he cannot have offered in person. The festival probably lasted for seven or eight days,but even then a thousand victims can hardly have been offered whole (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) unless the altar was greatly enlarged, or additional temporary altars were erected. This latter supposition is not negatived by the next words. See on 1 Kings 8:63, 64.] <span class="cmt_word">upon that altar.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 He that loved the Lord, should, for his sake, have fixed his love upon one of the Lord's people. Solomon was a wise man, a rich man, a great man; yet the brightest praise of him, is that which is the character of all the saints, even the poorest, He loved the Lord. Where God sows plentifully, he expects to reap accordingly; and those that truly love God and his worship, will not grudge the expenses of their religion. We must never think that wasted which is laid out in the service of God.</body></html>
