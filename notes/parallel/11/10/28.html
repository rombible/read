If the reading of the Hebrew text is to stand, the sense appears to be, "And Solomon's horses were brought from Egypt; a troop of the king's merchants obtained a troop (of horses) at a fixed price." The horses were brought up (that is) in caravans from the plains of Egypt, where they abounded (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-17.htm" title="And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.">Genesis 47:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm" title="Behold, the hand of the LORD is on your cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.">Exodus 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-9.htm" title="But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.">Exodus 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm" title="Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm" title="Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm" title="How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?">Isaiah 36:9</a>), although from their not being represented on the monuments before the eighteenth dynasty it is thought they were introduced from abroad, perhaps by the <span class= "ital">Hyksos</span>, or shepherd kings. But the LXX. has a remarkable various reading "and from Tekoa" (from which the Vulg. <span class= "ital">et de Coa</span>, probably comes), according to which the passage runs very simply: "And Solomon's horses were brought from Egypt; and from Tekoa the king's merchants," &c. Tekoa lay on the hills to the east of Hebron, not far from Bethlehem, and might well be an emporium for caravans from Egypt. The parallel passages of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/1-16.htm" title="And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.">2Chronicles 1:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-28.htm" title="And they brought to Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.">2Chronicles 9:28</a>, give us no help, for the former is exactly the same as this, and the latter runs thus: "And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt and out of all lands."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</span> [This is a difficult passage, and the difficulty lies in the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, here rendered "linen yarn." Elsewhere the word signifies, a <span class="accented">congregation</span>, or <span class="accented">gathering</span>, as of water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-36.htm">Leviticus 11:36</a>). Consequently, Gesenius (with Vatablus, <span class="accented">al</span>.) would here interpret, "company." "And the <span class="accented">company</span> of kings' merchants took the <span class="accented">company</span> (of horses) at a price." The great difficulty in the way of this interpretation is perhaps the paronomasia, which, though not altogether without precedent, would be formal and unusual in grave history. Somewhat similarly Bahr: "and as to horses... and their collection, the merchants of the king made a collection for a certain price," but this again is strained and artificial. Perhaps it is safer to see in the word the name of a place. The LXX. (similarly the Vulgate) renders, "from Egypt <span class="accented">and from Thekoa</span>," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span>, which Keil, however, contends is manifestly a variation of an older reading, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span>, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">from</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;</span>." As to Koa or Kova, it is objected that no such place is mentioned elsewhere, and it is alleged that if it were a market for horses, or even if it were a frontier station, where the duties on horses were collected, we should surely have heard of it again. But this is by no means certain. Koa may well have been an in. significant post on the frontier which it was only necessary to mention in this connexion. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span> certainly looks like an emendation, but it is to be remembered that although Tekoa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) was apparently an insignificant village, still it gave its name to a district; it was no great distance from the Egyptian frontier - it was some six Roman miles south of Bethlehem, according to Jerome (<span class="accented">in Amos</span>, Proem.), and it may have been the rendezvous of the Egyptian and Hebrew horse dealers. The text would thus yield the following meaning: "And as for the expert of Solomon's horses from Egypt and from Koa (or Tekoa), the king's merchants took them from Koa (or Tekoa) at a price." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:14-29 Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.</body></html>
