So he finished the house.">1Kings 9:25</a>) the red sandal-wood found in China and the Indian Archipelago, and still used for precious utensils in India. The "pillars for the house of the Lord" could not have been any of the larger supports of the Temple. They are usually supposed to have been (see margin) "rails" or "balustrades" for stairs. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-11.htm" title="And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.">2Chronicles 9:11</a>.) For the harps and the "psalteries" (which appear to have been like our guitars) the beauty and hardness of the word would be especially appropriate. These represent the stringed instruments chiefly in use in the service of the Temple. The harp (kinnor) is the more ancient, traced (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-21.htm" title="And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.">Genesis 4:21</a>) even to antediluvian times. The psaltery (nebel) is first mentioned (generally with the harp) in the Psalms. Both seem to have been played either with the hand, or with a plectrum or quill.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the navy of Hiram also</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, built and equipped by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26-28</a>], <span class="cmt_word">that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees</span> [In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10</a>, called "algum trees."

Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, by Solomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God, by our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligently searching the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experienced Christians, and by practising what we have learned, we shall be delivered from difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression upon the queen of Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is a spiritual excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians, to which no reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and all who, through grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the one half was not told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom's ways. Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that the thousandth part was not told them, 1Co 2:9. She pronounced them happy that constantly attended Solomon. With much more reason may we say of Christ's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in his house; they will be still praising him. She made a noble present to Solomon. What we present to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so to express our gratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will return to his station, discharge his duties with readiness, and from better motives; looking forward to the day when, being absent from the body, he shall be present with the Lord.</body></html>
