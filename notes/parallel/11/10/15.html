And the word is nowhere else used of traders. For the construction, see Ewald 287<span class="accented">e</span>], <span class="cmt_word">and of the traffick</span> [it is noteworthy that no such word is used before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> above] <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the spice</span> [not in Hebrews] <span class="cmt_word">merchants</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> Like the preceding word, the primary meaning is to <span class="accented">go about</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5d5;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>); hence, to <span class="accented">trade</span>. It is probable that Solomon's great commercial enterprises were conducted for his own benefit, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the merchants were little more than agents, who bought and sold for the king. Such is the custom of Eastern kings (Kitto)], <span class="cmt_word">and of all the kings of Arabia</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> is very variously interpreted. According to Gesenius it means <span class="accented">foreigners</span>, and he would understand "foreign kings who made an alliance with the Israelites," and so the Chaldee. Keil: "the kings of the mixed population" (mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>). Perhaps the words are best explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>: "The kings of Arabia (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) and ... of the mingled people (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>) that dwell in the desert," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the desert of <span class="accented">Arabia deserta</span>, bordering on Palestine. The chronicler here gives us <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, not the Arabia of the geographers, but the tract of country south and east of Palestine, as far as the Red Sea (Gesenius). No doubt these kings, who were great sheepmasters, paid their tribute in flocks of sheep and goats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and of the governors of the country.</span> [The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (cf. ch. 20:24) is a foreign word, perhaps Sanskrit, apparently borrowed by the Jews from the Persians. It is used of Tatnai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a>), of Zerubbabel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>), and of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>). Probably our author, in whose day it was a familiar and well understood word, substituted it for some older Hebrew designation. But the office and character of these "governors" is more difficult to define than the name. Rawlinson thinks that, in some parts of the empire, the kings - the "empire of Solomon," he observes, "was in the main a <span class="accented">congeries</span> of small kingdoms" - "had been superseded by governors." But it seems as natural to understand the term of the twelve prefects mentioned in chap. 4, who were "the governors of the land," or of similar officers in the different outposts of the kingdom. We know that the contributions which passed through their hands were furnished <span class="accented">in kind</span>; hence, perhaps, it is that this income is distinguished from the gold of ver. 14. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:14-29 Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom.
