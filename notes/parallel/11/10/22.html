For (<span class= "ital">a</span>) Tarshish is first noted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-4.htm" title="And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.">Genesis 10:4</a> as among the descendants of Javan, the son of Japhet, which probably points to a European position; (<span class= "ital">b</span>) in some other places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm" title="The burden of Tyre. Howl, you ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-6.htm" title="Pass you over to Tarshish; howl, you inhabitants of the isle.">Isaiah 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-10.htm" title="Pass through your land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.">Isaiah 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-14.htm" title="Howl, you ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.">Isaiah 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/27-12.htm" title="Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs.">Ezekiel 27:12-13</a>) as here, and in 23:48, it is closely connected with Tyre, of which Tartessus is expressly said by Arrian to have been a colony: (<span class= "ital">c</span>) from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-3.htm" title="But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.">Jonah 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-2.htm" title="And he prayed to the LORD, and said, I pray you, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before to Tarshish: for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repent you of the evil.">Jonah 4:2</a>, we gather that it was on the Mediterranean Sea; (d) the silver, which was evidently the chief import by this navy of Tarshish, was in ancient times found in large quantities in Spain, as also "the iron, lead, and tin," mentioned with the silver in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm" title="Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs.">Ezekiel 27:12</a>. But the phrase "ships of Tarshish" appears to have become a technical phrase for ships of large size (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-17.htm" title="And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.">Isaiah 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-9.htm" title="Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.">Jeremiah 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-8.htm" title="As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.">Psalm 48:8</a>); hence a "navy of Tarshish" would not necessarily mean a navy going to Tarshish.<p>Now, the fleet of Solomon here named is not in the text identified with the navy of Ophir, starting from Ezion-geber. Its imports (except gold, which is not distinctive) are not the same, and the separate mention of it seems rather to argue its distinctness. "The sea," moreover, unless otherwise determined by the context, would most likely mean the Great, or Mediterranean Sea; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-21.htm" title="For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">2Chronicles 9:21</a> (as also afterwards, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm" title="And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.">2Chronicles 20:36</a>) it is expressly said that the fleet "went to Tarshish." But the difficulty of this view lies in this--that the imports of the fleet, except the silver (which, indeed, is chiefly dwelt upon), point to an Eastern, and probably an Indian origin. Not only do the "peacocks" expressly indicate India, which may be called their native country; but of the names used, <span class= "ital">koph</span>, for "ape," is not a Hebrew word, but closely resembles the Sanscrit <span class= "ital">kapi</span>; and <span class= "ital">tukki</span>, for "peacock," is similarly a foreign word, closely resembling the Tamil toka. (If the ordinary reading, <span class= "ital">shen</span> <span class= "ital">habbim</span>, for "ivory," stands, this, which is an unusual word for ivory (generally simply <span class= "ital">shen</span>, "a tooth"), bears resemblance again in its second member to <span class= "ital">ibha</span>, the Sanscrit name for "elephant." But it is generally thought that the correction, <span class= "ital">shen habnim</span>, "ivory [and] ebony," should be accepted, especially as we find those two words used together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-15.htm" title="You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, till iniquity was found in you.">Ezekiel 28:15</a>.) The only solution of this serious difficulty seems to be the supposition of a circumnavigation of Africa by fleets from Tyre to Ezion-geber, touching in Africa and India. This view also accounts for the emphatic mention of the "three years" voyage, which could not be necessary for going only to Tartessus and its neighbourhood. There is, indeed, something startling in the idea of so daring an enterprise in this early age. But there is a well-known passage in Herodotus (Book iv. 42) which records exactly such a voyage in the days of Pharaoh-Necho, not apparently as a new thing--to say nothing of the celebrated record of the <span class= "ital">Periplus</span> of Hanno; and it seems clear that the Tyrian seamanship and maritime enterprise were at their height in the days of Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> [Reason why silver was so lightly esteemed. It was because of the prodigious quantity both of gold and silver brought in by the fleet] <span class="cmt_word">the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish</span> [It has been much disputed <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> whether this was a second fleet, or the same as that mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26-28</a>, as trading to Ophir, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> whether this fleet, if it were not the same, went to Ophir or to Tartessus in Spain. Keil and Bahr contend that there was Out one fleet, first, because there is no mention of a second fleet at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>, and, secondly, because the cargoes were practically the same. I incline (with Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al</span>.) to think there were two separate navies, for the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The expression "navy of Tarshish" (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-21.htm">2 Chronicles 9:21</a> expanded into "ships <span class="accented">going to</span> Tarshish," which Keil and Bahr are compelled to set aside as a mistake on the part of the writer), taken in connexion with the following words, "with (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">together with, as well as</span>) the navy of Hiram" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as we conclude from ver. 11, the navy <span class="accented">manned</span>, or, it may be, <span class="accented">owned</span>, by Hiram) points to a separate fleet; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the cargoes, so far from being the same, strike me as being altogether diverse. The Ophir fleet brought in "gold, almug trees, and precious stones." The navy of Tarshish "gold and silver ivory, apes, and peacocks." See below. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Even if we understand here by the "navy of Hiram" a Phoenician fleet, still a second fleet is indicated. But this leads us to consider the destination of these ships. The term, "fleet of Tarshish," does not in itself prove anything, for the expression, "ships of Tarshish," is almost a synonym for "merchant vessels." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a> we read, "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish <span class="accented">to go to Ophir</span>," and they "were broken at Ezion-geber" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). It is probable that in Jewish lips the words were a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> for all vessels going long voyages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; compare our "East Indiaman," "Greenlander"). But the words "in the sea," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, are most naturally understood of that ocean which the Jews called <span class="accented">par excellence</span> "the sea," or "the great sea" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6, 7</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Mediterranean, though the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> is undoubtedly used of the Red Sea, the Sea of Galilee, and the Dead Sea. And the more so as we know that the Tyrians had an extensive commerce with Tartessus, which was a great emporium of trade from the earliest times. Bahr objects that "no gold is found in Spain, but few peacocks, and little ivory;" but Rawlinson, on the other hand, affirms that "Spain had the richest silver mines known in the ancient world, and had a good deal of gold also" (Plin., Nat. Hist. 3:4), while "apes and ivory were produced by the opposite coast of Africa" (Herod. 4:191. As to peacocks see below). And it is a powerful argument in favour of Tartessus that it is the plentifulness of <span class="accented">silver</span> in Solomon's days has suggested this reference to the fleet. For though silver "was found in the land of the Nabataeans, according to Strabo, 16:784" (Keil), yet it was to Tartessus that the ancient world was chiefly indebted for its supplies of that metal. On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that second fleet, trading with the Mediterranean seaports, is here described. And <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a> is distinctly in favour of this conclusion. When Ewald says ("Hist. Israel," 3:263) that the Phoenicians would hardly tolerate a rival in the Mediterranean, he surely forgets that they had been admitted by the Jews to share the trade of Ophir] <span class="cmt_word">with the navy of Hiram; once in three years</span> [This period agrees better with a voyage to Spain than to Southern Arabia. And if we understand it of Spanish voyages, it removes one difficulty in the way of placing Ophir in Arabia. It has also been urged that "the Hebrews reckoned parts of years and days as whole ones" (Kitte); but this hardly would apply to the expression "once in three years"] <span class="cmt_word">came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver ivory</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">tooth of elephants</span>, LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. It is noteworthy that the name for elephant used here is derived from the Sanskrit (Gesen.), and an argument has been drawn hence in favour of placing Ophir in India, and of identifying the Tarshish fleet with the navy of Ophir. But such conclusions are extremely precarious. The name may have first come to the Jews from India, in which case it would be retained, from whatever quarter the commodity was subsequently derived. See Rawlinson, p. 546], and apes [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span>is in like manner identified by Gesenius, <span class="accented">al</span>., with the Sanskrit <span class="accented">kapi</span>. Sir J. Emerson Tennant ("Ceylon," 2 p 102) says "the terms by which these articles (ivory, apes, and peacocks) are designated in the Hebrew Scriptures are identical with the Tamil names by which some of them are called in Ceylon to the present day"], <span class="cmt_word">and peacocks.</span> [So the the ancients interpret the original word, though some of the moderns would understand "parrots." But the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d9;</span> appears in several Aryan tongues (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="accented">pavo</span>) as indicating the peacock (Gesen., Max Muller, <span class="accented">al</span>.) which originally came from India. Whether it was also found in Africa is uncertain. Aristophanes (Birds, 485) says, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Wordsworth very justly sees in the mention of these curious beasts and birds a symptom of declension in simplicity and piety, a token that "wealth had brought with it luxury and effeminacy, and a frivolous, vainglorious love for novel and outlandish objects.' <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:14-29 Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.</body></html>
