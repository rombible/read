the "horse" is the charger. The price (though so far considerable as to indicate a large expenditure on the whole) shows that the supply was large, and the commerce regular.<p><span class= "bld">The kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria</span>--evidently allies or tributaries of Solomon, who were allowed, or compelled, to purchase their horses and chariots through his merchants. Of all the earlier inhabitants of Palestine the Hittites alone are mentioned as having existed in power after the conquest (as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2Kings 7:6</a>); and this statement is curiously confirmed by both Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions, describing a powerful confederacy of Hittites in the valley of the Orontes in Syria, not far from Ph?nicia, with whom both empires waged war. The possession of horses and chariots by the northern confederacy round Hazor is especially noted in the history of the Conquest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/11-4.htm" title="And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is on the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.">Joshua 11:4-6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a chariot</span> [including perhaps the two or three horses (see note on 1 Kings 5:6) usually attached to a chariot, and the harness. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-20.htm">Ezekiel 39:20</a>) for <span class="accented">chariot and horses</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver</span> [about &pound;80 (Wordsworth, &pound;35), but, as these figures show, the precise value cannot be ascertained with certainty. But it is quite clear that these amounts cannot have been the custom duty, or the profits after reckoning all expenses (Ewald) paid on chariots and horses, but must represent the actual price], <span class="cmt_word">and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites.</span> [We can hardly see in these Hittites representatives of the seven nations of Canaan (Wordsworth, <span class="accented">al</span>.), though the term "Hittite" is sometimes undoubtedly used as a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> for Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>), for the Canaanitish bes had been reduced to bond service, the Hittites amongst them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>). The word is probably used somewhat loosely of the semi-independent tribes bordering on Palestine, the <span class="accented">Khatti</span> of the Assyrian inscriptions (Dict. Bib. 1:819), with whom Solomon had a sort of alliance. It is a curious coincidence that we find horses and chariots associated in popular estimation with the Hittites, at a later period of the history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>). Nor are we justified in supposing that these horses and chariots were furnished as cavalry to "Solomon's vassals, whose armies were at his disposal, if he required their aid" (Rawlinson), for the kings of Syria are mentioned presently, and some of these at least were enemies to Solomon. Probably all we are to understand is that neighbouring nations received their supply of horses from Egypt - the home of horses and chariots (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2-4</a>) - largely through the instrumentality of Solomon's merchants], <span class="cmt_word">and for the kings of Syria</span> ["who became the bitterest enemies of Israel" (Wordsworth): one fruit of a worldly policy], did they bring them out by their means. [Heb. <span class="accented">by their hand they brought them out, i.e.</span>, they exported them through Solomon's traders. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:14-29 Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.</body></html>
