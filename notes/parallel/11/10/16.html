We have notices of shields of gold among the Syrians of Zobah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.">2Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-7.htm" title="And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 18:7</a>), and of shields hung on the walls of Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/27-10.htm" title="They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness.">Ezekiel 27:10-11</a>). The use of such ornaments argues a plethora of gold, too great to be absorbed either in currency or in personal and architectural decorations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And king Solomon made two hundred targets</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from a root which signifies <span class="accented">protect</span>, a large oblong shield, which covered the entire person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>), <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">scutum</span>.

This rendering is supported by Bahr and Keil (after Kimchi), but Gesenius understands <span class="accented">mixed</span> gold. Rawlinson infers from the <span class="accented">weight</span> that the shields were only plated (shields were commonly made of wood, covered with leather). But whether they were solid or not does not decide the question whether the gold was pure or alloyed. "Shields of gold" are mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; 1 Macc. 6:39]: six hundred shekels [Heb. omits <span class="accented">shekels</span>, as elsewhere, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, etc. There were apparently two kinds of shekel, the Mosaic and the royal (for the latter see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm">2 Samuel 14:26</a>). The former was twice as much as the latter, but there is no agreement amongst commentators as to the weight or value of either. Nor can we be certain which is indicated here. Thenius decides for the former, and estimates the weight of the gold on each target to be 17 &frac12; lbs., and the value to be 6000 thalers (&pound;900), or, according to Keil, 5000 thalers (&pound;750). Keil, however, inclines to the belief that the royal shekel is meant, in which case the weight would be 9 lbs., and the value about &pound;400. Bahr, however, estimates the gold at no more than &pound;78 (523 thalers)] of gold went to one target. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:14-29 Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.</body></html>
