The Tyrians are described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-15.htm" title="The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of your hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony.">Ezekiel 27:15</a> as receiving it through Dedan in Arabia, whither, no doubt, it came from India. But the Egyptians used ivory largely, drawing it from Africa; and there was, in later times, a port on the Red Sea which was a mart for ivory. The Tyrians may, therefore, have imported it both from India and from Africa. The throne of Solomon was probably inlaid with ivory and gold. Traces of such inlaying are found in Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. It is probable that, like his other architectural and decorative work, it was executed by Tyrian workmen, and the detailed description of it shows how greatly it impressed the imagination of Israel. The lion was the emblem of the house of Judah; the number twelve corresponded to the twelve tribes; and the exaltation of the throne--specially remarkable in a country where men sat commonly on the ground or on cushions--was the emblem of majesty. In the <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span> ("THRONE") is given a sketch of an Assyrian throne, from a Nineveh bas-relief, which has horses in the position, supporting "the stays," or arms of the throne, here ascribed to the lions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the ling made a great throne</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">seat</span>. The use of a chair where the custom of the country is to squat on the ground, or to recline on a divan, is always a mark of dignity. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-10.htm">2 Kings 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-14.htm">Proverbs 9:14</a>] <span class="cmt_word">of ivory</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">tooth</span>. Below in ver. 22 we have <span class="accented">elephant's tooth</span>. It is generally thought that this "throne of the house of David" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-5.htm">Psalm 122:5</a>) was of wood, veneered with ivory, as was the practice in Assyria (Rawlinson, "Ancient Monarchies," 1. p. 463), and in the chryselephantine statues of the Greeks (Paus. 2:4. 1; 6:25. 4, etc.) Bahr says there is no more necessity for believing this throne to have been of solid ivory than the "ivory house" mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>.

[It is very unlikely that the gold entirely covered and concealed the ivory, especially if the latter was merely a veneer. Keil and Bahr consider that the gold was laid on the wood and the ivory inserted between the plates, but the text does not speak of overlaying with ivory, but of overlaying ivory with gold. And the presumption is that the ivory was solid. In the Greek statues both ivory and gold were applied in <span class="accented">laminae</span>, the former representing the flesh, the latter the drapery.] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:14-29 Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.</body></html>
