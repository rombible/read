Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.">Genesis 10:7</a>), connected, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm" title="For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior: I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.">Isaiah 43:3</a>;

in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to you, they shall make supplication to you, saying, Surely God is in you; and there is none else, there is no God.">Isaiah 45:14</a>, with Egypt and Cush, and named with Sheba ("the kings of Sheba and Seba")in the Psalm of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm" title="The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.">Psalm 72:10</a>). Seba is, indeed, with great probability identified (see Jos. Ant. ii. 10, 2) with the Ethiopian city and island of Meroe. It is probably from confusion between Sheba and Saba that Josephus (Ant. viii. 6, 5) represents the queen of Sheba as a "queen of Egypt and Ethiopia." (<span class= "ital">b</span>) The name "Sheba" is found in the ethnological lists of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm" title="And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.">Genesis 10:7</a>, among the descendants of Cush of the Hamite race, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-28.htm" title="And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,">Genesis 10:28</a>, among the Semitic Joktanites, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm" title="And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.">Genesis 25:3</a>, among the Abrahamic children of Keturah. The kingdom of Sheba referred to in this passage must certainly be placed in Arabia Felix, the habitation of the Joktanite race (in which the Keturahites appear to have been merged), for the Cushite Sheba is probably to be found elsewhere on the Persian Gulf. The queen of Sheba would therefore be of Semitic race, not wholly an alien from the stock of Abraham.<p><span class= "bld">The fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord.</span>--If the reading of the text be correct, the phrase "concerning: the name of the Lord" (to which there is nothing to correspond in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-1.htm" title="And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.">2Chronicles 9:1</a>) must refer to the constant connection of the fame of Solomon--especially in relation to his wisdom, which is here mainly referred to--with the name of Jehovah, as the God to whom, in the erection of the Temple, he devoted both his treasure and himself.<p><span class= "bld">Hard questions</span>--or, riddles. The Arabian legends preserved in the Koran enumerate a list of questions and puzzles, propounded by the queen and answered by Solomon, too puerile to be worth mention. The "hard questions" (in which Solomon is said by Josephus to have had a contest with Hiram also) must surely have been rather those enigmatic and metaphorical sayings, so familiar to Eastern philosophy, in which the results of speculation, metaphysical or religious, are tersely embodied. The writings representing the age of Solomon--Job, Proverbs, and (whatever be its actual date) Ecclesiastes--are all concerned with these great problems, moral and speculative, which belong to humanity as such, especially in its relation to God. In solving these problems, rather than the merely fantastic ingenuity of what we call riddles, the wisdom of Solomon would be worthily employed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the queen of Sheba</span> [There is no good ground for doubting that by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> we are to understand the kingdom of Southern Arabia (Yemen). It is true that while <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>) speaks of Sheba, the son of <span class="accented">Joktan</span>, one of the colonists of southern Arabia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a> mention another Sheba, the son of <span class="accented">Cush</span>, and a doubt has arisen whether this was an Arabian or an Ethiopian princess, and it is alleged that she was the latter by Josephus, who calls her "queen of Egypt and Ethopia," and by some Rabbinical writers, and in the traditions of the Abyssinian church. But the kingdoms of Sheba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Saba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) are entirely distinct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>), the latter being the name both of the capital and country of Meroe, a province of Ethopia (Joshua, Ant. 2:10. 2); while the former in like manner designates both the chief city and also the kingdom of the Sabeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>). This tribe would seem to have grown richer and stronger than all the other Arabian peoples by means of its commercial enterprise, and it was especially famed for its gold, gems, and spices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>). It is noticeable that in both kingdoms government by female sovereigns was not uncommon (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>); but it is very remarkable to find any country under the rule of a queen at this early date.

The Arabian mind has ever delighted in dark sayings, enigmas, etc., and extensive collections of these have been made by Burckhardt and others (see Keil <span class="accented">in loc</span>.)

Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, by Solomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God, by our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligently searching the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experienced Christians, and by practising what we have learned, we shall be delivered from difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression upon the queen of Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is a spiritual excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians, to which no reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and all who, through grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the one half was not told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom's ways. Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that the thousandth part was not told them, 1Co 2:9. She pronounced them happy that constantly attended Solomon. With much more reason may we say of Christ's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in his house; they will be still praising him. She made a noble present to Solomon. What we present to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so to express our gratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will return to his station, discharge his duties with readiness, and from better motives; looking forward to the day when, being absent from the body, he shall be present with the Lord.</body></html>
