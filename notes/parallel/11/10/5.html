The word "servants" is, perhaps, to be understood of state officers; the word "ministers" of personal attendants (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>, etc.) That the latter were an inferior class, the "standing" shows], <span class="cmt_word">and their apparel</span> [cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-29.htm">Matthew 6:29</a>. The rich and costly dress of Eastern courtiers and attendants is sometimes furnished by the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-8.htm">Esther 5:8</a>; 1 Macc. 10:20. Cf. Chardin, "Voyage en Perse," 3:230], <span class="cmt_word">and his cupbearers</span> [By this <span class="accented">word</span> Keil would understand "drinking arrangements." But see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>, "cupbearers (same word) and <span class="accented">their apparel"</span>], <span class="cmt_word">and his ascent</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>. It is somewhat doubtful whether we are to interpret this word, <span class="accented">ascent</span>, or <span class="accented">burnt offering</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-18.htm">2 Kings 16:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a> make for the former, and the chronicler has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>. which undoubtedly means "ascent." But all the translations understand the word of burnt offerings - the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x28;</span> and the word, "which occurs at least 300 times in the Bible," always (with one exception) signifies burnt offering. It is objected against this interpretation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that we should require the plural, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "burnt offerings;" but this is by no means certain, as the historian may refer to one particular holocaust (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>) which the queen witnessed; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the sight of burnt offerings could not have caused her any astonishment (Keil). But their prodigious <span class="accented">number</span> may surely have done so; and we are certainly to understand that Solomon was remarkable for the <span class="accented">scale</span> of his sacrifices. Considering, however, that the word undoubtedly means "ascent" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>, and that it is so paraphrased by the chronicler, it is perhaps safer to retain this rendering here]; <span class="cmt_word">there was no more spirit in her</span> [same expression <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>, and cf. 2:11. For various legends as to this queen, see Stanley, "Jewish Ch." 2. pp. 234-236]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-13 The queen of Sheba came to Solomon to hear his wisdom, thereby to improve her own. Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, by Solomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God, by our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligently searching the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experienced Christians, and by practising what we have learned, we shall be delivered from difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression upon the queen of Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is a spiritual excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians, to which no reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and all who, through grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the one half was not told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom's ways. Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that the thousandth part was not told them, 1Co 2:9. She pronounced them happy that constantly attended Solomon. With much more reason may we say of Christ's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in his house; they will be still praising him. She made a noble present to Solomon. What we present to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so to express our gratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will return to his station, discharge his duties with readiness, and from better motives; looking forward to the day when, being absent from the body, he shall be present with the Lord.</body></html>
