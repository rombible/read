The "liver," like the "heart" and the "bowels," is thought of as the centre of all intense emotions, both of joy or sorrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-23.htm" title="Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hastens to the snare, and knows not that it is for his life.">Proverbs 7:23</a>). As such it is represented as giving way without restraint (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-19.htm" title="Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out your heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.">Lamentations 2:19</a>), under the pressure of the horror caused by the calamities which the next words paint, by the starving children who fainted for hunger in the streets of the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My bowels are troubled</span> (see on Lamentations 1:20). <span class="cmt_word">My liver is poured upon the earth.</span> A violent emotion being supposed to occasion a copious discharge of bile. <span class="cmt_word">The daughter of my people</span>. A poetic expression for Zion or Judah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 Causes for lamentation are described. Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fear God, and walk humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.</body></html>
