Yet more boldly their cry is an appeal to the "wall" of Zion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-8.htm" title="The LORD has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he has stretched out a line, he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.">Lamentations 2:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm" title="Howl, O gate; cry, O city; you, whole Palestina, are dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.">Isaiah 14:31</a>), to take up its lamentation, as though it were a human mourner.<p><span class= "bld">Like a river.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">like a torrent.</span><p><span class= "bld">The apple of thine eye.--</span>Literally, "the <span class= "ital">daughter," </span>as in the English phrase, the "pupil" of the eye.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their heart cried unto the Lord,</span> etc. "Their heart" can only mean "the heart of the people of Jerusalem." For the expression, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>, "My heart and my flesh cry aloud to the living God." To avoid the rather startling prosopopoeia in the next clause, Thenius supposes a corruption in the group of letters rendered "wall," and attaches the corrected word to the first clause, rendering thus: "Their heart crieth unto the Lord in vain; O daughter of Zion, let tears run down," etc. Another resource, which also involves an emendation, is that of Ewald, "Cry with all thy heart, O wall of the daughter of Zion." <span class="cmt_word">O wall,</span> etc. The prosepopoeia is surprising, but is only a degree more striking than that of ver. 8 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a> we find an equally strong one, "Howl, O gate." Most probably, however, there is something wrong in the text; the following verses seem to refer to the daughter of Zion. Bickell reads thus: "Cry aloud unto the Lord, O virgin daughter of Zion." <span class="cmt_word">Like a river;</span> rather, <span class="accented">like a torrent. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Give thyself no rest.</span> The word rendered "rest" means properly the stiffness produced by cold. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 Causes for lamentation are described. Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fear God, and walk humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.</body></html>
