In that thought, terrible as it might at first seem, there was an element of hope. It was better to fall into the hands of God than into those of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-14.htm" title="And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.">2Samuel 24:14</a>). The suffering came as a chastisement for past transgressions, and might therefore be mitigated by repentance. The Destroyer was also the Healer, and would answer the prayers of those who called on Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His word that he had commanded,</span> etc. "Commanded," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> given in charge to.

Zechariah continues, in language which illustrates the foregoing words of this verse, "Did they not take hold of [overtake] your fathers;" where the persons spoken of as "your fathers" are the same as those who are represented by the speaker of the elegy. "In the days of old;" alluding, perhaps, to such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The horn of thine adversaries</span>. "Horn" has a twofold meaning - "strength" or "defence" (comp. ver. 3), and "honour" or "dignity" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). The figure is too natural to need explanation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 Causes for lamentation are described. Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fear God, and walk humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.</body></html>
