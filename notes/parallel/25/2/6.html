"King and priest," the two representatives of the nation's life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-21.htm" title="Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.">Jeremiah 33:21</a>), were alike, as it seemed, rejected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violently taken away;</span> rather, <span class="accented">violently treated; i.e.</span> broken up. <span class="cmt_word">His tabarnacle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his booth.</span> "Tent" and "dwelling" are interchangeable expressions (see ver. 4); and in the Psalms "booth" is used as a special poetic synonym for tent when God's earthly dwelling place, the sanctuary of the temple, is spoken of (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>). The Authorized Version, indeed, presumes an allusion to the proper meaning of the Hebrew word, as if the poet compared the sanctuary of Jehovah to a pleasure booth in a garden. It is, however, more natural to continue, <span class="accented">as a garden</span>, the sense of which will be clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12, 13</a>. The Septuagint has, instead, "as a vine" - a reading which differs from the Massoretic by having one letter more (<span class="accented">kaggefen</span> instead of <span class="accented">kaggan</span>). This ancient reading is adopted by Ewald, and harmonizes well with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>); but the received text gives a very good sense. "Garden" in the Bible means, of course, a plantation of trees rather than a flower garden. <span class="cmt_word">His places of the assembly;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his place of meeting</span> (<span class="accented">with God</span>). The word occurs in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a>. It is the temple which is meant, and the term is borrowed from the famous phrase, <span class="accented">ohel mo'edh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; comp. 25:22). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 A sad representation is here made of the state of God's church, of Jacob and Israel; but the notice seems mostly to refer to the hand of the Lord in their calamities. Yet God is not an enemy to his people, when he is angry with them and corrects them. And gates and bars stand in no stead when God withdraws his protection. It is just with God to cast down those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin; and to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and ordinances, who have not duly valued nor observed them. What should they do with Bibles, who make no improvement of them? Those who misuse God's prophets, justly lose them. It becomes necessary, though painful, to turn the thoughts of the afflicted to the hand of God lifted up against them, and to their sins as the source of their miseries.</body></html>
