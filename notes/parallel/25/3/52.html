The hypothesis receives some confirmation from the apparent reference in the "dungeon" and the "waters" to the narrative of Jeremiah 38. It has been urged, on the other hand, that those expressions may be figurative here, as they are in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm" title="Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.">Psalm 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-7.htm" title="Your wrath lies hard on me, and you have afflicted me with all your waves.

He speaks as a representative of the nation; if we should not rather say that the nation itself, personified, is the speaker. In the first triad some have supposed a reference to the persecution suffered by Jeremiah at the hands of his countrymen. The "dungeon," or rather "pit," will in this case be the "dungeon" ("pit") mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>. But a "pit" is a figure in the psalms for destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>), and there is nothing recorded in Jeremiah as to the" princes" haying cast stones at Jeremiah, or rolled a stone on to the top of the "pit." Besides, the "pit" into which the prophet was cast had "no water, but mire." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine enemies... without cause.</span> These words ought to be connected, as in the Hebrew. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:42-54 The more the prophet looked on the desolations, the more he was grieved.
