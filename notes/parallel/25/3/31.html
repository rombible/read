The first, a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-7.htm" title="Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more?">Psalm 77:7</a>, had been of old a favourite thought of the writer's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm" title="Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done evil things as you could.">Jeremiah 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm" title="Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.">Jeremiah 3:12</a>). The second (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-32.htm" title="But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.">Lamentations 3:32</a>) rests on the fact that compassion underlies chastisement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm" title="For his anger endures but a moment; in his favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.">Psalm 30:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm" title="For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole.">Job 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm" title="In a little wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, said the LORD your Redeemer.">Isaiah 54:8</a>); the third (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-33.htm" title="For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.">Lamentations 3:33</a>) on the truth that the primary eternal will of God is on the side of love, and that punishment is, as it were, against that will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-33.</span> - Two grounds of comfort: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the trouble is only for a time, and God will have compassion again (vers. 31, 32); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> God does not afflict in a malicious spirit (ver. 33). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:21-36 Having stated his distress and temptation, the prophet shows how he was raised above it. Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.</body></html>
