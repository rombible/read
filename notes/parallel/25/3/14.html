But the Massora mention <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, as passages in which "my people" is used, whereas we should expect "peoples." The Syriac Version of our passage actually translates "to all peoples," and the prefixed "all" certainly favours the plural, and so, in a far higher degree, does the view we have been led to adopt of the speaker of this Lamentation (see Introduction). The correction (<span class="accented">ammim</span> for <span class="accented">ammi</span>) has been received by Archbishop Seeker, by Ewald, and by J.

In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup. The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe. But the weakest believer is wrong, if he thinks that his strength and hope are perished from the Lord.</body></html>
