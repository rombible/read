The roads leading to it, the "gates" by which it was entered, were no longer thronged with pilgrims and worshippers. "Virgins" are joined with "priests" as taking part in the hymns and rejoicing processions of the great festivals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm" title="The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with tambourines.">Psalm 68:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/21-19.htm" title="Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.">Judges 21:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-13.htm" title="Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.">Jeremiah 31:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ways of Zion do mourn</span>. The reads leading to Jerusalem, usually so thronged with pilgrims, are desolate and "mourn" (comp. ch. 2:8 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All her gates are desolate.</span> No one goes in or out of Jerusalem, and there is no concourse of citizens in the shady recess of the gates. <span class="cmt_word">The virgins are afflicted.</span> So <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-18.htm">Zephaniah 3:18</a>. The sorrow was on account of the cessation of the festival, in the music of which they took a leading part (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The prophet sometimes speaks in his own person; at other times Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of the Jews. The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.</body></html>
