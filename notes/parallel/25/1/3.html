but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:">Jeremiah 42:14</a>), to avoid the oppression to which they were subject in their own land. The Hebrew admits, however, of the rendering "from affliction," and so the words speak of the forcible deportation of the people from misery at home to a yet worse misery in Babylon as the land of their exile. Even there they found no "rest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-65.htm" title="And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>) Their persecutors hunted them down to the "straits" from which no escape was possible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is gone into captivity because of affliction;</span> rather, <span class="accented">is gone into exile</span>, etc. The poet is not thinking of the deportation of the captives, but of those Jews who sought refuge for themselves in foreign lands (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11</a>). An objection has been raised to this view that the number of fugitive Jews would not be large enough to warrant their being called "Judah." But we might almost as well object on a similar ground to the application of the term "Judah" to the Jews who were carried to Babylon. The truth may, perhaps, be that, after the fall of Jerusalem, the Jewish nation became split up into three parts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Jews who succeeded in escaping into Egypt or elsewhere; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those who were carried captive; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the mass of the common people, who remained on their native soil, Keil, however, retains the view of the Authorized Version, only substituting "out of" for "because of." "Out of" the misery into which the Jews had been brought by the invasions of Necho and Nebuchadnezzar they passed into the new misery of captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Among the heathen;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among the nations. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Between the straits.</span> The phrase is peculiar, and reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, "Out of the strait I called unto thee." "A strait," or narrow place, clearly means adversity, just as "a large place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>) means prosperity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The prophet sometimes speaks in his own person; at other times Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of the Jews. The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.</body></html>
