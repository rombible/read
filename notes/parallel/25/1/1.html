and (2) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/lamentations/1-12.htm" title="Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow, which is done to me, with which the LORD has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.">Lamentations 1:12-22</a>, more dramatic in its form, in which the daughter of Zion bewails her own miseries. Each verse is divided into three lines, each line beginning, in the Hebrew, with the same letter. The opening picture reminds us of the well-known <span class= "ital">Jud?a capta, </span>a woman sitting under a palm-tree, on the Roman medals struck after the destruction of Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">How is</span> <span class= "bld">she become.</span>--Better, making one sentence instead of two, <span class= "ital">She is become a widow that was great among the nations, </span>and so with the clause that follows.<p><span class= "bld">Provinces.</span>--The word, used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even to Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)">Esther 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-22.htm" title="For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.">Esther 1:22</a>, and elsewhere, of the countries subject to Persia and Assyria and so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm" title="Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and came again to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his city;">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-6.htm" title="These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;">Nehemiah 7:6</a>, of Judah itself, here indicates the neighbouring countries that had once, as in the reign of Hezekiah, been subject to Judah. "Tributary," as used here, implies, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm" title="And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and serve under tribute.">Joshua 16:10</a>, personal servitude, rather than the money payment, for which, at a later period, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/10-1.htm" title="And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the isles of the sea.">Esther 10:1</a>, it was commuted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How</span>. The characteristic introductory word of an elegy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4, 12</a>), and adopted by the early Jewish divines as the title of the Book of Lamentations. It is repeated at the opening of ch. 2 and ch. 4. <span class="cmt_word">Sit solitary.</span> Jerusalem is poetically personified and distinguished from the persons who accidentally compose her population. She is "solitary," not as having retired into solitude, but as deserted by her inhabitants (same word as in first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-10.htm">Isaiah 27:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">How is she become as a widow!</span> etc. Rather, <span class="accented">She is become a widow that was great among the nations; a princess among the provinces, she is become a vassal.</span> The alteration greatly conduces to the effect of the verse, which consists of three parallel lines, like almost all the rest of the chapter. We are not to press the phrase, "a widow," as if some. earthly or heavenly husband were alluded to; it is a kind of symbol of desolation and misery (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>). "The provinces" at once suggests the period of the writer, who must have been a subject of the Babylonian empire. The term is also frequently used of the countries under the Persian rule (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1, 22</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6</a> is used of Judah itself. Here, however, the "provinces," like the "nations," must be the countries formerly subject to David and Solomon (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The prophet sometimes speaks in his own person; at other times Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of the Jews. The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.</body></html>
