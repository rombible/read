Some think that this verse relates solely to the miserable survivors. This is possible; at any rate, it includes the contemporaries of the writer. "Sigh" and "seek" are participles in the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">To relieve the soul;</span> literally, to <span class="accented">bring back the soul.</span> The "soul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the principle of life, is conceived of as having for a time deserted the fainting frame. <span class="cmt_word">See, O Lord,</span> etc. Another piteous cry of Jerusalem, preparing the way for the second half of the elegy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The prophet sometimes speaks in his own person; at other times Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of the Jews. The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.</body></html>
