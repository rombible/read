<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-16.htm" title="And for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelled in the bush: let the blessing come on the head of Joseph, and on the top of the head of him that was separated from his brothers.">Deuteronomy 33:16</a>), whether by rank or by the vows of consecration. There is no reason, however, for abandoning the rendering of the Authorised version. The reference to the Nazarites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/2-11.htm" title="And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O you children of Israel? said the LORD.">Amos 2:11-12</a> shows that they were prominent as a body during the history of the monarchy, and the drift of Jeremiah's mind, as seen in his admiration of the Rechabites (Jeremiah 35), shows that he was likely to think of them with reverence. The temperance, purity, cleanliness of such a body seem to have made them conspicuous among their fellows for an almost angelic beauty. (Comp. the interesting parallel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-15.htm" title="And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.">Daniel 1:15</a>.) They had the red and white complexion which was in the East the ideal of comeliness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-42.htm" title="And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.">1Samuel 17:42</a>; Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-10.htm" title="My beloved is white and ruddy, the most chief among ten thousand.">Song of Solomon 5:10</a>). Their "polishing" (better, <span class= "ital">their form</span>) was faultless, like that of a well cut sapphire. For "rubies" read <span class= "ital">coral.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her Nazarites;</span> rather, <span class="accented">her eminent ones</span> (just as Joseph is called <span class="accented">n'zir ekhav,"</span>eminent among his brethren"). The rendering of the Authorized Version is lexically possible, but is intrinsically improbable. The Nazarites constituted too small a portion of the Jewish people to receive so prominent a place in the elegy. <span class="cmt_word">Rubies</span>; rather, corals. <span class="cmt_word">Their polishing</span> was <span class="cmt_word">of sapphire;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their shape was</span> (<span class="accented">like</span>) <span class="accented">a sapphire.</span> But the point in which the sapphire is compared to the bodies of the princes is evidently not the outline of its form, but its gleaming brilliant appearance; so that the Authorized Version is substantially correct. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 What a change is here! Sin tarnishes the beauty of the most exalted powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried in the fire, which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; its outward appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never be changed. The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee in rebellion, yet turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy name. Come to us, bless us with awakening, converting, renewing, confirming grace.</body></html>
