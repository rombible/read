The cry "unclean" was that uttered by the leper as a warning to those he met (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm" title="And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.">Leviticus 13:45</a>).

The cry with which the leper was directed to warn off passengers, lest they should become infected (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>). There may be an allusion to this, but, though commonly accepted, the view is not certain, as the" leper" in the present case is not the person who raises the cry, but those who meet him. <span class="cmt_word">When they fled away and wandered.</span> The clause is difficult. If the text is correct, Keil's explanation may perhaps pass, "When they fled away, (there) also they wandered," alluding to the "wandering" ascribed to them with a somewhat different shade of meaning in the preceding verso. In any case there ought to be a fuller stop than a comma after "touch not," which words close the first of the two parallel lines of which the verse consists. But very probably "when" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ki</span>) is an intrusion, and we should begin the second line thus: "They fled, they also wandered about." <span class="cmt_word">They said among the heathen,</span> etc. Even in their place of exile they found no rest (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>). This is better than understanding "the heathen" (literally, <span class="accented">the nations</span>) to mean "the Chaldean army," and the place of sojourn prohibited to be Jerusalem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-20 Nothing ripens a people more for ruin, nor fills the measure faster, than the sins of priests and prophets. The king himself cannot escape, for Divine vengeance pursues him. Our anointed King alone is the life of our souls; we may safely live under his shadow, and rejoice in Him in the midst of our enemies, for He is the true God and eternal life.</body></html>
