The "gold" and the <span class= "ital">stones of holiness </span>are none other than the material treasures of palace or temple, and the repetition of the phrase "in the top of every street," used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-19.htm" title="Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out your heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.">Lamentations 2:19</a> of children, seems intended to indicate that the words include all that was most precious among the possessions of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How is the gold become dim!... the stones of the sanctuary,</span> etc. "Alas for the sad sights of the capture of Jerusalem! The most fine gold has lost its brilliance now that the fire of Nebuzar-adan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>) has passed over it, and the precious stones, consecrated to Jehovah, have been cast out into the open street!" Not that the latter part of this description can have corresponded to literal fact. None of the hallowed jewels would have been treated with such indifference. The expression must be as figurative as the parallel one, "to cast pearls before swine," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>. The precious stones are the "sons of Zion," who are compared to "fine gold" in ver. 2, precisely as they are in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a> (comp. ver. 13," Thy sons, O Zion") to "the stones of a crown." They are called "stones of the sanctuary," in allusion, perhaps, to the precious stones employed in the decoration of the temple according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>. But we may also translate <span class="accented">hallowed stones</span>, which better suits the figurative use of the phrase. Those, however, who adopt the literal interpretation, explain "the stones of the sanctuary" of the hewn stones of the fabric of the temple, which are described as "costly" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>. But how can even a poet have represented the enemy as carrying these stones out and throwing them down in the street? On the other hand, in an earlier lamentation we are expressly told that the young children "fainted for hunger in the top of every street" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 What a change is here! Sin tarnishes the beauty of the most exalted powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried in the fire, which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; its outward appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never be changed. The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee in rebellion, yet turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy name. Come to us, bless us with awakening, converting, renewing, confirming grace.</body></html>
