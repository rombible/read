A similar conception of the king was generally prevalent in antiquity.

For the Jewish, or Old Testament, conception, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a>, where (as the Septuagint shows) "his people" and "his anointed" are used almost synonymously. <span class="cmt_word">Was taken in their pits.</span> A figure from hunting (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>).
