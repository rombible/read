No one word can express this obvious interpretation of the original, taken as it must be in completion of the verse before; and certainly "religion" in its ordinary sense will not convey the right idea. Real worship, we may say, pure and undefiled, beheld and acknowledged as such in the presence of God, even the Father--mark the tender pathos of His divine relationship--is this:<p><span class= "bld">To visit the fatherless </span>(or, <span class= "ital">orphans</span>) <span class= "bld">and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span>--Here is the double proof of the perfect life of holiness, the savour whereof is as perpetual incense before the throne of God. And the help afforded to the helpless, put thus in the first place of the two requirements, will often bring about the second--namely, that spotless condition of unworldliness which marks, and will ever mark, the true servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. Deeds of benevolence may be and are often done by those who are not His; but all who truly belong to Him must live a life which praises Him continually in good works; not, it is hardly needful to say, as a cause--but rather the natural and inevitable result of love for Him, warming the heart within.<p>Scrupulous indeed were the "religious" contemporaries of James; they would not enter where the image of Divus Caesar had its votive flame, while they were ceremonially clean for the keeping of their passover--"they went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28</a>). But He whom there they cruelly sought to slay had told them before, though in vain, "that which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-20.htm" title="And he said, That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.">Mark 7:20</a>), and "nothing from without can defile him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-15.htm" title="Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.">James 1:15</a>). What an eternal caution may be learned here against cold reliance upon ritual! What an instance, ever, under all varieties and forms, to be applied to themselves by the erring; persecuting, and deceitful sons of men! while, on the other hand, from these words of the wise Apostle we may be sure what is truest, nay, the only true service, acceptable and accepted, of the Most High--"To visit the fatherless and the widow," beholding in them a new image of Christ, the Man of Sorrows, is to show pity verily to Him; and at the last such "pure religion" will receive His own approval. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-40.htm" title="And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.">Matthew 25:40</a>).

The not bridling the tongue, readiness to speak of the faults of others, or to lessen their wisdom and piety, are signs of a vain religion. The man who has a slandering tongue, cannot have a truly humble, gracious heart. False religious may be known by their impurity and uncharitableness. True religion teaches us to do every thing as in the presence of God. An unspotted life must go with unfeigned love and charity. Our true religion is equal to the measure in which these things have place in our hearts and conduct. And let us remember, that nothing avails in Christ Jesus, but faith that worketh by love, purifies the heart, subdues carnal lusts, and obeys God's commands.</body></html>
