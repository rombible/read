Often must the Apostle have seen such an effect of the fiery-Eastern sun, scorching with its pitiless glare the rich verdure of the wilderness; and in his ear, perchance, was the cry of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/40-6.htm" title="The voice said, Cry.

The warning is rather (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-24.htm" title="And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answers again, and said to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!">Mark 10:24</a>) "for them that <span class= "ital">trust</span> in riches."

There seems, moreover, looking closely at the text, a special fitness in its exact words: for they mean that the rich shall perish in their journeyings for the sake of gain; and to no people could the rebuke apply more sharply than to the Jews, the lenders unto "many nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-6.htm" title="For the LORD your God blesses you, as he promised you: and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over you.">Deuteronomy 15:6</a>), the merchants and bankers of the world. Nor can "the sword of the Spirit," unsheathed from this Word of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>), be without an edge for those of us in these latter times who err in the former ways.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> . <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>.

Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.</body></html>
