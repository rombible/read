There is a force in the original sentence, which our own language cannot supply. The term "deceiving" is the contrary of that rendered "word," and means its corruption; the Word which is the source of knowledge and life may be so handled as to cause error and death. No acquaintance with the Bible, apart from the practice of its precepts, will avail the Christian any more than it did the Jew. "For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers shall be justified" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a>). Those who deceive themselves may not altogether be hypocrites; there is a subtler danger of being blind, and nevertheless exclaiming "We see." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.">John 9:41</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - They are not merely to receive and <span class="accented">hear</span> the Word; they must also <span class="accented">act</span> upon it. Compare St. Paul's teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>, "For not the hearers (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) <span class="accented">of</span> a law are just before God, but the doers of a law shall be justified." <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> occurs nowhere else except in these passages. <span class="cmt_word">Deceiving your own selves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); to lead astray by false reasonings; only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4</a>. Not uncommon in the LXX. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:22-25 If we heard a sermon every day of the week, and an angel from heaven were the preacher, yet, if we rested in hearing only, it would never bring us to heaven. Mere hearers are self-deceivers; and self-deceit will be found the worst deceit at last. If we flatter ourselves, it is our own fault; the truth, as it is in Jesus, flatters no man. Let the word of truth be carefully attended to, and it will set before us the corruption of our nature, the disorders of our hearts and lives; and it will tell us plainly what we are. Our sins are the spots the law discovers: Christ's blood is the laver the gospel shows. But in vain do we hear God's word, and look into the gospel glass, if we go away, and forget our spots, instead of washing them off; and forget our remedy, instead of applying to it. This is the case with those who do not hear the word as they ought. In hearing the word, we look into it for counsel and direction, and when we study it, it turns to our spiritual life. Those who keep in the law and word of God, are, and shall be, blessed in all their ways. His gracious recompence hereafter, would be connected with his present peace and comfort. Every part of Divine revelation has its use, in bringing the sinner to Christ for salvation, and in directing and encouraging him to walk at liberty, by the Spirit of adoption, according to the holy commands of God. And mark the distinctness, it is not for his deeds, that any man is blessed, but in his deed. It is not talking, but walking, that will bring us to heaven. Christ will become more precious to the believer's soul, which by his grace will become more fitted for the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
