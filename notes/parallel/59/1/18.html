So tenderly is this declared, that a maternal phrase is used--<span class= "ital">God brought us forth</span> in the new birth; and though "a woman" may forget "the son of her womb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-15.htm" title="Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yes, they may forget, yet will I not forget you.">Isaiah 49:15</a>), yet will He "never leave, nor forsake" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm" title="Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have: for he has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you.">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That we should be a kind of firstfruit of his creatures.</span>--And why this mercy and loving-kindness? for our own sakes, or for others and for His? Surely the latter; and "if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm" title="For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.">Romans 11:16</a>). We know "Who is the firstborn of every creature" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>) "the firstbegotten of the dead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

The longing for a future perfection is shared by all created beings upon earth, and their discontent at present imperfection points to another state freed from evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-18.htm" title="For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.">Romans 8:18-22</a>). "The creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same in hope" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,">Romans 8:20</a>). And the fruition of this hope is foreshadowed in the words above. "The very struggles," it has been well observed by Dean Howson, "which all animated beings make against pain and death show that pain and death are not a part of the proper laws of their nature, but rather a bondage imposed upon them from without; thus every groan and fear is an unconscious prophecy of liberation from the power of evil." "The creature itself also shall be delivered" is the plain assertion of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>); comparing his with that of St. James, we must conclude that they point to all nature, animate and inanimate as well. "We look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a>), and "there shall be no more death . . . nor any more pain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm" title="And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p>"All creation groans and travails;<p>Thou, O Lord, shalt hear its groan,<p>For of man, and all creation,<p>Thou alike art Lord alone."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Begat</span>; literally, <span class="accented">brought forth</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The word has been already used of sin in ver. 15. The recurrence of it here points to the connection of thought. The offspring of sin has been shown to be death. God, too, who is both Father and Mother (Bengel), has his offspring. But how different! <span class="cmt_word">Us</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>). To whom does this refer? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> To all Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> To Christians of the apostolic age. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> To Jewish Christians, to whom the Epistle is specially addressed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Probably (3). Just as Israel of old was Jehovah's firstborn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>), so now the germ of the Christian Church, as found in these Judaeo-Christian communities, was to be "a kind of firstfruits." The thought may be illustrated from a striking parallel in Philo ('De Creat. Princ.'): <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>. Transfer this from the Jewish to the Judaeo-Christian communities, and we have the very thought of the apostle. <span class="cmt_word">By the word of truth</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>, where, as here, the new birth is connected with the Word of God). <span class="cmt_word">A kind of firstfruits of his creatures</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>). The image is taken from the wave sheaf, the firstfruits of the harvest, the earnest of the crop to follow. St. Paul (according to a very possible reading) has the same figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>, "God chose you as firstfruits (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>);" see R.V. margin. Elsewhere he applies it to Christ, "the Firstfruits of them that are asleep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). "His creatures (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." It does not appear to be absolutely necessary to extend the use of this word so as to include the irrational creation as well as mankind. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> is frequently used in rabbinical writings for <span class="accented">the Gentile world</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> may be given the same meaning here, and perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 It is not every man who suffers, that is blessed; but he who with patience and constancy goes through all difficulties in the way of duty. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.</body></html>
