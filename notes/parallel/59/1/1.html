Scattered abroad indeed they were, "a by-word among all nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-37.htm" title="And you shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations where the LORD shall lead you.">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>), "a curse and an astonishment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm" title="And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them:">Jeremiah 29:18</a>) wherever the Lord had driven them. But there is something figurative, and perhaps prophetic, in the number twelve. Strictly speaking, at the time this Epistle was written, Judah and Benjamin, in great measure, were returned to the Holy Land from their captivity, though numbers of both tribes were living in various parts of the world, chiefly engaged, as at the present day, in commerce. The remaining ten had lost their tribal distinctions, and have now perished from all historical record, though it is still one of the fancies of certain writers, rather pious than learned, to discover traces of them in the aborigines of America, Polynesia, and almost every where else; most ethnologically improbable of all, in the Teutonic nations, and our own families thereof. But long before the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, and even the preaching of Christianity, Jewish colonists were found in Europe as well as Asia. "Even where they suffered most, through their own turbulent disposition, or the enmity of their neighbours, they sprang again from the same undying stock, however it might be hewn by the sword or seared by the fire. Massacre seemed to have no effect in thinning their ranks, and, like their forefathers in Egypt, they still multiplied under the most cruel oppression." (See Milman's <span class= "ital">History of the Jews, </span>vol. i., p. 449, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) While the Temple stood these scattered settlements were colonies of a nation, bound together by varied ties and sympathies, but ruled in the East by a Rabbi called the Prince of the Captivity, and in the West by the Patriarch of Tiberias, who, curiously, had his seat in that Gentile city of Palestine. The fall of Jerusalem, and the end therewith of national existence, rather added to than detracted from the authority of these strange governments; the latter ceased only in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius, while the former continued, it is said, in the royal line of David, until the close of the eleventh century, after which the dominion passed wholly into the hands of the Rabbinical aristocracy, from whom it has come down to the present day. The phrase "in the dispersion" was common in the time or our Lord; the Jews wondered whether He would "go unto the dispersion amongst the Gentiles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>, and see <span class= "ital">Note</span> there).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - SALUTATION. <span class="cmt_word">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> (On the person who thus describes himself, see the Introduction.) It is noteworthy that he keeps entirely out of sight his natural relationship to our Lord, and styles himself simply "a bond-servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ." That, and that alone, gave him a right to speak and a claim to be heard. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is similarly used by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a> by St. Peter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; and by St. Jude ver. 1. It is clearly an <span class="accented">official</span> designation, implying that his office is one "in which, not his own will, not the will of other men, but only of God and of Christ, is to be performed" (Huther). <span class="cmt_word">To the twelve tribes</span>, etc. Compare the salutation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>, which was also probably written by St. James: "The apostles and the elder brethren unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is common to both, and not found elsewhere in apostolic greet-tugs. (It is used by Ignatius in the opening of all his epistles except that to the Philadelphians.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The letter in the Acts is addressed to <span class="accented">Gentile</span> communities in <span class="accented">definite</span> regions; St. James's Epistle, to <span class="accented">Jews of the dispersion.</span> So also his contemporary Gamaliel wrote "to the sons of the dispersion in Babylonia, and to our brethren in Media, and to all the dispersion of Israel" (Frankel, 'Monatsschrift,' 1853, p. 413). <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>; Clem., 'Rom,' l, &sect; 55; 'Prefer. Jacob.,' c.i.). Such expressions are important as tending to show that the Jews were regarded as representing, not simply the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, but the whole nation, including those so often spoken of as "the lost tribes" (cf. 1 Esdr. 7:8). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span>. The abstract put for the concrete. It is the word used by the LXX. for the "dispersion" (2 Macc. 1:27; Jud. 5:19; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, etc.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jews "so scattered among the nations as to become the seed of a future harvest" (Westcott on St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a>). (On the importance of the dispersion as preparing the way for Christianity, see the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 44:1.) It was divided into three great sections: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">Babylonian</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the original dispersion; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Syrian</span>, dating from the Greek conquests in Asia, Seleucus Nicator having transplanted largo bodies of Jews from Babylonia to the capitals of his Western provinces; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="accented">Egyptian</span>, the Jewish settlements in Alexandria, established by Alexander and Ptolemy I., and thence spreading along the north coast of Africa. To these we should, perhaps, add a fourth - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the <span class="accented">Roman</span>, consequent upon the occupation of Jerusalem by Pompey, <span class="date">B.C. 63</span>. All these four divisions were represented in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-8.htm">Acts 2:8-11</a>) - a fact which will help to account for St. James's letter. The whole expression, "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad," makes it perfectly clear that St. James is writing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Jews, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to those beyond the borders of Palestine. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.</body></html>
