Do we not pray in our Saviour's words, "Lead us not into temptation"? (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>, and Note there.) Yet a little consideration will open out the teaching of Holy Scripture very plainly. The Apostle here is following the same line of thought as that expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>. By use (or <span class= "ital">habit, </span>more properly) our senses may be exercised to the discernment of good and evil. The grace of God given to the soul is capable of growth and enlargement, like the powers of body and mind. If either be unemployed, weakness must supervene, and eventually decay and death. And just as the veteran who has proved his armour well, and learned to face habitual danger as a duty, is more trustworthy than a raw recruit, however large of limb and stout of heart, so with the Christian soldier. He must learn to "endure hardness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2Timothy 2:3</a>), and bear meekly and even gladly all the trials which are to strengthen him for the holy war. Innocence is a grace indeed, and yet there is a higher stage of the same virtue, viz., the purity which has been won by long and often bitter conflict with the thousand suggestions of evil from without, stirring up the natural impurity within. Temptation is not sin. "You cannot," says the old German divine, "prevent the birds flying over your head, but you can from making nests in your hair;" and the soul victorious over some such trying onset is by that very triumph stronger and better able to undergo the next assault, The act of virtue has, in truth, helped to build up the habit, from which, when it is perfected, a happy life cannot fail to spring. The interpretation of our Lord's prayer is rather the cry for help to God our Father in the trial, than for actual escape from it: Lead us not, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, where we in our free will may choose the wrong and perish. And there is a strangely sweet joy to be snatched from the most grievous temptation in the remembrance that "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-18.</span> - THE SUBJECT OF TEMPTATION. This section may be subdivided as follows: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The value of temptation (vers. 2-4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Digression suggested by the thought 'of perfection (vers. 5-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Return to the subject of temptation (vers. 12-18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> <span class="accented">- The value of temptation.</span> Considered as an <span class="accented">opportunity</span>, it is a cause for joy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My brethren</span>. A favorite expression with St. James, occurring no less than fifteen times in the compass of this short Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Count it all joy</span>, etc.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6</a>, "Wherein ye greatly <span class="accented">rejoice</span>, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief <span class="accented">in manifold temptations</span>, that the <span class="accented">proof of your faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)... might be found unto praise," etc. The coincidence is too close to be accidental, although the shade of meaning given to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is slightly different, if indeed it has any right in the text in St. Peter (see Herr, vol. it. p. 102). Here it has its proper force, and signifies <span class="accented">that by which the faith is tried</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the instrument of trial rather than the process of trial. Thus the passage in ver. 3 becomes parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>, "tribulation worketh patience." With regard to the sentiments of ver. 2, "Count it all joy," etc., contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>. Experience, however, shows that the two are compatible. It is quite possible to shrink beforehand from temptation, and pray with intense earnestness, "Lead us not into temptation," and yet, when the temptation comes, to meet it joyfully, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The use of this word implies that the temptations of which St. James is thinking are <span class="accented">external</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30</a>, where the same word is used of the man <span class="accented">who fell among</span> thieves). <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32, 33</a> will show the trials to which believing Jews were subject. But the epithet "manifold" would indicate that we should not confine the word here to trials such as those. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.</body></html>
