The earnest student of the Scriptures stoops down in humility of body and mind to learn what the will of their Author may be. He reads, as it were, upon his knees; and if he finds therein a law, it is one of liberty and not slavery, life and not death--although, as Dean Alford observes here, "not in contrast with a former law of bondage, but as viewed on the side of its being the law of the new life and birth, with all its spontaneous and free development of obedience."<p><span class= "bld">Not a forgetful hearer . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">not a hearer of forgetfulness, but a doer of work.</span> Thus rendered, the words of the sentence balance each other, and comment is needless.<p><span class= "bld">This man shall be blessed in his deed.</span>--Or, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">doing.</span> A return perhaps in thought to the Beatitudes, and the close of that Sermon on the Mount, of which they were the opening words. The blessedness of this humbly active Christian is like that of the wise man there spoken of "which built his house upon a rock" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:">Matthew 7:24-25</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- Application of the illustration in the form of a contrast.</span> Looketh into (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). For the literal sense of the word, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>. The figurative meaning occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>. Properly it signifies to "peep into." See its use in the LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6</a>; Ecclus. 21:23. When used figuratively, it conveys the idea of looking into, but scarcely with that <span class="accented">intensive</span> force which is often given to it and for which <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> would be required (see Dr. Field's 'Otium Norvicense,' p. 147). Its use in St. Peter, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, is easy enough to explain. Angels desire even a glimpse of the mysteries. But what are we to say of its use hero? Is it that, though the man took a good look at himself in the glass (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, consider, <span class="accented">is</span> a very strong word; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>), yet he forgot what he was like, while the man who only peeps into the law of liberty is led on to abide (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) and so to act? <span class="cmt_word">The perfect law of liberty</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the perfect law</span>, <span class="accented">even the law of liberty</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. The substantive is anarthrous, yet the attributive has the article. This construction serves to give greater prominence to the attributive, and requires the rendering given above (see Winer, &sect; 20:4). The conception of the gospel as a "law" is characteristic of St. James (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-8.htm">James 2:8</a>, "the royal law," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-11.htm">James 4:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A forgetful hearer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hearer characterized by forgetfulness, contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> doer characterized by <span class="accented">work.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:22-25 If we heard a sermon every day of the week, and an angel from heaven were the preacher, yet, if we rested in hearing only, it would never bring us to heaven. Mere hearers are self-deceivers; and self-deceit will be found the worst deceit at last. If we flatter ourselves, it is our own fault; the truth, as it is in Jesus, flatters no man. Let the word of truth be carefully attended to, and it will set before us the corruption of our nature, the disorders of our hearts and lives; and it will tell us plainly what we are. Our sins are the spots the law discovers: Christ's blood is the laver the gospel shows. But in vain do we hear God's word, and look into the gospel glass, if we go away, and forget our spots, instead of washing them off; and forget our remedy, instead of applying to it. This is the case with those who do not hear the word as they ought. In hearing the word, we look into it for counsel and direction, and when we study it, it turns to our spiritual life. Those who keep in the law and word of God, are, and shall be, blessed in all their ways. His gracious recompence hereafter, would be connected with his present peace and comfort. Every part of Divine revelation has its use, in bringing the sinner to Christ for salvation, and in directing and encouraging him to walk at liberty, by the Spirit of adoption, according to the holy commands of God. And mark the distinctness, it is not for his deeds, that any man is blessed, but in his deed. It is not talking, but walking, that will bring us to heaven. Christ will become more precious to the believer's soul, which by his grace will become more fitted for the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
