Two words are translated by our one "gift"; the first is rather the act of giving, the second the gift itself, and the effect of both together is a climax to the statement of God's benevolence. The difference between the two is observed in the Genevan version of 1557. "There are diversities of gifts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:4</a>), even as "one star differeth from another star in glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-41.htm" title="There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differs from another star in glory.">1Corinthians 15:41</a>), but "the same Spirit" is the giver of all. Where in St. John's Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-1.htm" title="There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:">John 3:1</a>) we read, "Except a man be born again," the most probable meaning is "from above," expressed exactly as in the present case; and thus we know whence is the true birth of the soul.<p><span class= "bld">Cometh down from the Father of lights.</span>--Great difference of opinion is found concerning these "lights," whether the term be figurative, as of goodness or wisdom; or a reference to the mysterious Urim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) which flamed on the breast of Aaron; or spiritual, as of grace and glory; or material, viz., the "lights" set "in the firmament of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-14.htm" title="And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:">Genesis 1:14-15</a>) "when the morning stars sang together" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a>). It were not amiss to take the whole of these interpretations, for they, and perhaps others, the purport of which we as yet can barely guess, are included in this Scripture. "God," remarks Bishop Wordsworth, "is the Father of all lights--the light of the natural world, the sun, the moon, and stars, shining in the heavens; the light of reason and conscience; the light of His Law; the light of prophecy, shining in a dark place; the light of the gospel shining throughout the world; the light of apostles, confessors, martyrs, bishops, and priests, preaching that gospel to all nations; the light of the Holy Ghost shining in our hearts; the light of the heavenly city; God is the Father of them all. He is the everlasting Father of the everlasting Son, who is the Light of the world." But that the mind of the sacred writer was mainly on the lights of the material universe may be seen from his next thought.<p><span class= "bld">With whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</span>--The phraseology is almost scientific. There are changes, literally "parallaxes," of the heavenly bodies themselves, and eclipses one of another by shadows projected through space, but no such variableness with God, nor changing of faintest shade. And even further, the greatest and most marvellous of His works on high "must be dissolved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-11.htm" title="Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness,">2Peter 3:11</a>), "the sun darkened, the moon not give her light, the stars fall from heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>), and the heavens themselves "be rolled together as a scroll" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>). But if "the things which are seen are temporal, the things which are not seen are eternal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.">2Corinthians 4:18</a>). "I am the Lord," is the burden of His latest prophet; "I change not" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm" title="For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed.">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every good gift</span>, etc. The words form a hexameter verse, though this is probably accidental, and no sign that they are a quotation. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> should be distinguished. "Every kind of gift that is good, and every one that is perfect in its kind" (Dean Scott). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> occur together in the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>. They are expressly distinguished by Philo, who says that the latter involves the idea of magnitude and fullness, which is wanting to the former (see Lightfoot on 'Revision,' p. 77) "Every good gift and every perfect boon, R.V. <span class="cmt_word">The Father of lights</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The word must refer to the heavenly bodies, of which God may be said to be the Father, in that he is their Creator (for "Father," in the sense of Creator, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-28.htm">Job 38:28</a>). From him who "made the stars also" comes down every good and perfect gift, and with him "there can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning." These last words appear to fix the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span> is used in the LXX. as in classical writers for the changes of the heavenly bodies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-33.htm">Job 38:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-14.htm">Deuteronomy 33:14</a>; Wisd. 7:18). <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, "there is no room for." It negatives, not only the fact, but the possibility also (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 It is not every man who suffers, that is blessed; but he who with patience and constancy goes through all difficulties in the way of duty. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.</body></html>
