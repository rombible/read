There is wide misapprehension of our state of trial: the poor and humble are apt to forget the honour thus vouchsafed to them, worthier in truth than the wealth of this world, which quickly fades away; and the rich and noble are often unmindful of the true source of their dignity, and that "unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-48.htm" title="But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted</span> (or, better, <span class= "ital">in his exaltation</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--There is no praise from the plain St. James for the pride which apes humility, nor the affectation which loves to be despised. If it please God to "exalt," as of old, "the humble and meek," then anew should be sung a <span class= "ital">magnificat</span> to Him. The lowly-minded doubt of the Virgin Mary, "How shall this be?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-24.htm" title="And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,">Luke 1:24</a>), was not reproved by the angel; while the question of blunt incredulity on the part of Zacharias was severely punished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm" title="And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.">Luke 1:20</a>), and this diverse treatment thus experienced was deserved in either case. Both doubted, yet quite differently, and she of the lower degree rejoiced most in God her Saviour for regarding the lowliness of His handmaiden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-47.htm" title="And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.">Luke 1:47-48</a>). Willingness thus for Christ's service, whether it be great or little, is the right condition of mind for all disciples, and specially the young, with readiness, nay gladness, for "duty in that state of life unto which it <span class= "ital">shall</span> please God to call them." Pleasure will be naturally felt by most at the prospect of a rise in the world; but there are some finer spirits who fain would shrink from anything like exaltation; and to these the kindly Apostle writes that they may take heart, and not fear the greater dangers which of necessity accompany a higher call.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - A very difficult passage, three interpretations of which are given, none of them entirely satisfactory or free from difficulties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his Christian dignity]; but let the rich [brother glory] in his humiliation" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in being poor of spirit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "But let the brother," etc. (as before); "but the rich man [rejoices] in his humiliation" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in what is really his degradation; cf. "whose glory is in their shame," <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "But let the brother,... but let the rich [grieve] in his humiliation." The ellipse of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span> in this last is <span class="accented">very</span> harsh and unexampled, so that the choice really lies between (1) and (2). And against (1) it may be urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that the "rich" are never elsewhere spoken of as "brothers" in this Epistle. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-1.htm">James 5:1</a>, and cf. the way in which they are spoken of in other parts of the New Testament (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-24.htm">Luke 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-23.htm">Matthew 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a>); and in Ecclus. 13:3; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that in ver. 11 the thought is, not of <span class="accented">riches</span> which make to themselves wings and fly away, but of the <span class="accented">rich man himself</span>, who fades away; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is elsewhere always used for external lowness of condition, not for the Christian virtue of humility (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-33.htm">Acts 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>). On the whole, therefore, it is best to adopt (2) and to supply the indicative: "but the rich man [not ' brother'] glories in his humiliation;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he glories in what is really lowering. Because as the flower, etc. A clear reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>, which is also quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-24.htm">1 Peter 1:24</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.</body></html>
