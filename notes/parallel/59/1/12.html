Such a one has a blessedness, greater infinitely than any earthly happiness, already in possession, and the promise of a future beyond all comparison.<p>It may be well to point out in this place that the idea of blessedness with regard to man is conveyed to us in the New Testament by a different word from that which expresses the like concerning God. The force of this may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-61.htm" title="But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?">Mark 14:61</a>, where the high priest asks our Lord, "Art Thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Blessed God, to show which the adjective is rightly printed with a capital letter. The word applied to God--as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>--may be almost called a Christian one; at least, it is not found in much earlier writings, whereas the other term descriptive of man's blessedness (or rather, happiness) is ancient and classical. Only in one passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1Timothy 1:11</a>) is there an exception to this remarkable distinction; and such may well be considered, as it is by the German critic De Wette, <span class= "ital">un-pauline, </span>though on no such a single instance, or even several such, could the superstructure be built that has been raised up by those who deny the genuineness of the Pastoral Epistles.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation.</span>--Surely the Apostle links such blessedness with the nine Beatitudes, heard in the happy days gone by upon the Mount with Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3-11</a>). The words he uses in the original are the same as those which are expressed above, in our second, third, and fourth verses, by "patience" and "trials," and mean a firm endurance, steadfastness, tenacity of purpose, and quenchless enthusiasm, such as men of Teutonic blood can appreciate perhaps even better than could either Greek or Jew.<p><span class= "bld">For when he is tried</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">proved, </span>or <span class= "ital">tested, and found worthy</span>) <span class= "bld">he shall receive the crown of life, </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., the life</span>) <span class= "bld">which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</span>--"Lord" is not found in the best MSS., but of course is required by the sense of the passage. Probably in this case, as in so many others, a little note--or "gloss," as it is called--was made on the margin of an early manuscript, and included unwittingly in the text by some later copyist.<p>The "pride" and "beauty" of the worldling are as "a fading flower" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm" title="Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!">Isaiah 28:1</a>) under the scorching sun; but the unfading, ever-living crown is for the spiritual, the true lovers of their Lord: blessed in truth are they who thus endure the trial. "Therefore," says the Book of Wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm" title="Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.">James 5:16</a>), "shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord's hand." "The righteous live for evermore" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-15.htm" title="But the righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High.">Wisdom Of Solomon 5:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - <span class="accented">Return to the subject of temptation.</span> Ver. 2 taught that temptation regarded as an <span class="accented">opportunity</span> should be a cause for joy. Ver. 12 teaches that the <span class="accented">endurance</span> of temptation brings a blessing from God, even the crown of life. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>, the only other place in the New Testament where the "crown of life" is mentioned; and there also it stands in close connection with the endurance of temptation. Elsewhere we read of the "crown of righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>), and the "crown of glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>). The genitive (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) is probably the gen. epex.," the crown, which is life." <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Received Text has but slight authority. It is wanting in A, B, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, ff, and is deleted by the Revisers, following all recent editors. Render, <span class="accented">which he promised</span>, etc. The subject is easily understood, and therefore, as frequently in Jewish writings (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> 1 Maccabees), omitted from motives of reverence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 It is not every man who suffers, that is blessed; but he who with patience and constancy goes through all difficulties in the way of duty. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.</body></html>
