"If any man . . . seem"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to himself, and not to others merely; the warning is not to the hypocrite, but the self-deceived. A Christian may have, or rather cannot help having, the feeling that he is a religious man; and so far well. But if such a one deceive his own heart, as confessedly he may, and give to those around him the proof of his self-delusion in not curbing his tongue, vain and useless is all his religious service. Just as some mistakenly suppose there can be a religion of hearing without acting, so others rest satisfied "in outward acts of worship, or exactness of ritual." "But," remarks Bishop Moberly on this passage, and his voice may win an audience where another's would not, "if a man think himself a true worshipper because he conforms to outward services, while he lets his tongue loose in untruth or unkindness or other unseemliness, he deceives himself." The first mark of true religion is gentleness of tongue, just as the contrary, blasphemy, is the most damning fault of all. Our Lord directly says, "By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a>). The text, however, is more a guide for self-examination than a stone to be cast at a neighbour; and "well is" it indeed for "him that hath not slipped with his tongue" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/25-8.htm" title="Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself:">Ecclesiasticus 25:8</a>).<p>The Apostle returns to this subject, though from a different point of view, in James 3, which compare with the above. The best commentary on the whole is Bishop Butler's Sermon, No. IV., "Upon the Government of the Tongue."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); seems to himself rather than to others; translate, with R.V., <span class="accented">thinketh himself to be.</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Si quis Putat se esse. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Religious</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). It is difficult to find an English word which exactly answers to the Greek. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> refers properly to the <span class="accented">external rites</span> of religion, and so gets to signify an over-scrupulous devotion to external forms (Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>); almost "ritualism." It is the ceremonial service of religion, the external forms, a body of which <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is the informing soul. Thus the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (the word apparently only occurs here in the whole range of Greek literature) is the diligent performer of Divine offices, of the <span class="accented">outward</span> service of God, but not necessarily anything more. This depreciatory sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> well seen in a passage of Philo ('Quod Det. Pot. 'Jus.,' 7), where, after speaking of some who would fain be counted among the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> on the score of diverse washings or costly offerings to the temple, he proceeds: <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> Trench on 'Synonyms,' from whom the reference is here taken). "How delicate and fine, then, St. James's choice of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>! 'If any man,' he would say, 'seem to himself to be <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a diligent observer of the offices of religion, if any man would render a pure and undefiled <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to God, let him know that this <span class="accented">consists</span>, not in outward lustrations or ceremonial observances; nay, that there is a better <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> than thousands of rams and rivers of oil, namely, to do justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7, 8</a>); or, according to his own words, ' to visit the widows and orphans in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world'" (Trench on 'Synonyms,' p. 170: the whole passage will well repay study. Reference should also be made to Coleridge, 'Aids to Reflection,' p. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Bridleth not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). The thought is developed more fully afterwards (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>, etc., and for the word, cf. Polyc., 'Ad Philippians,' c.v.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26,27 When men take more pains to seem religious than really to be so, it is a sign their religion is in vain. The not bridling the tongue, readiness to speak of the faults of others, or to lessen their wisdom and piety, are signs of a vain religion. The man who has a slandering tongue, cannot have a truly humble, gracious heart. False religious may be known by their impurity and uncharitableness. True religion teaches us to do every thing as in the presence of God. An unspotted life must go with unfeigned love and charity. Our true religion is equal to the measure in which these things have place in our hearts and conduct. And let us remember, that nothing avails in Christ Jesus, but faith that worketh by love, purifies the heart, subdues carnal lusts, and obeys God's commands.</body></html>
