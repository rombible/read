Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a>), or to suppose for one moment that God, and therefore power invincible, is drawing him from righteousness. Almost every reflection upon the nature of sin leads up to an inquiry as to its cause; and the enigma will hardly be solved in this life. The very facts of the presence of evil amongst God's creatures, and its continual attraction even for the best, have often driven men to doubt His supremacy. Sadly--how can we of charity think otherwise?--some have felt the pain, but not the purpose of the world. At times they cannot see in nature "the work of a Being at once good and omnipotent," and prefer to doubt the latter quality sooner than the former.<span class= "note">[14]</span> But this nineteenth-century conclusion is no advance beyond the dual system of the Persians, or rather, of Manes, who corrupted with his Indian fancies the faith of Zoroaster. The Manichees settled the difficulty better than our Deists by declaring the existence of a good God and a bad one; and appealed to the daily strife between virtue and vice, nay, life and death, in witness of their simple creed. Thanks to the gospel, a nobler theology is our Christian heritage, whereby we are persuaded that good will triumph at the last, and by which we are taught humility withal to own that God's ways in so permitting and overworking evil are beyond man's comprehension. And a better scepticism remains for us than that of the Theist, or Agnostic either; a disbelief more vehement that here can be the end, since in this life we experience in no sense the rewards of just and unjust to the full.<p><span class= "note">[14] Specially see J. S. Mill's "Three Essays on Religion." <span class= "ital">Nature, </span>p. 38.</span><p><span class= "bld">For God cannot be tempted with evil.</span>--We can see here a good instance of the excellence of the old Geneva Bible, "the first on several occasions to seize the exact meaning of a passage which all the preceding versions had missed." Our present rendering follows the Genevan exactly, rejecting those of Wiclif. "God is not a tempter of yuell things"; Tyndale, "God tempteth not vnto evyll"; and Cranmer, "God cannot tempte vnto euyll."<p><span class= "bld">Neither tempteth he any man.</span>--The trial comes of Him, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Tempter is allowed; but so far, and no further. God Himself is "unversed of evils," and no possibility of temptation remains with Him. Into the unseen splendour of His fulness no thought of wrong can enter; no foul thing wing its silent flight. It were blasphemy, perilously near that of the Pharisees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.">Matthew 12:22-37</a>) to think God's kingdom could be so divided against itself, that He, directly or indirectly, should seduce His subjects into the revolt of sin. No; if we have one golden clue by which we may feel our erring way out of the labyrinth of this lower world into the belief and trust in God our Father for the life to come, it is this: trials and temptations are permitted to strengthen us--if we will--for His mightier service. And, as compulsory homage would be worthless to the loving Lord of all, voluntary must be found instead, and proved and perfected. Herein is the Christian conflict, and the secret of God's ways with man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - God is not the author of temptation; cf.

Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.</body></html>
