Emotion and sentiment may have their place in the beginning of a Christian career, but the end thereof is not yet. Until the soul be quite unmoved by any attack of Satan, the work cannot be deemed "perfect." The doctrine is not mere quietism, much less one of apathy, but rather this, that the conscious strength of patient trust in God is able to say at all times (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-8.htm" title="My soul follows hard after you: your right hand upholds me.">Psalm 63:8</a>)--<p>"My soul hath followed hard on Thee;<p>Thy right hand hath upholden me."<p>And if in this patience we can learn to possess our souls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>) the perfect work of God will be wrought within us.<p><span class= "bld">That ye may be perfect and entire</span> (or, <span class= "ital">complete</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--A special proof herein for religious people may be taken with regard to temper. Few trials are harder; and sweetness of disposition often melts away from physical causes, such as ill-health or fatigue. But the great test remains; and it is one which the world will ever apply with scorn to the nominally Christian, refusing to admit the claims of saintliness on the part of any whose religion is not of the household as well as the Church. The entirety and completeness of the life hidden with Christ in God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>) are manifested most by self-restraint.<p><span class= "bld">Wanting nothing.</span>--The older version, "lacking," found in Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan Bible seems decidedly better. Here is no wish that the faithful should be free from care, heeding nothing; but rather that their whole lives might be without fault or flaw: a perfect sacrifice, as it were, offered up to God. And this idea is confirmed by reflecting on the original meaning of the word translated "entire" above in the Authorised version=complete, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as an offering, with no blemish.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Patience alone is not sufficient.

The figure, however, is probably rather that of the <span class="accented">full-grown</span> man. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, equivalent to "grown men" as opposed to children; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, sound in every part and limb (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-16.htm">Acts 3:16</a>).

The whole passage before us (vers. 2-6) affords a most remarkable instance of the figure called by grammarians anadiplosis, the repetition of a marked word at the close of one clause and beginning of another. "The trial of your faith worketh <span class="accented">patience</span>; but let <span class="accented">patience</span> have her <span class="accented">perfect</span> work, that ye may be <span class="accented">perfect</span> and entire, <span class="accented">lacking</span> in nothing. But if any man <span class="accented">lack</span> wisdom, let him <span class="accented">ask</span> of the <span class="accented">giving</span> God... and it shall be <span class="accented">given</span> him; but let him <span class="accented">ask</span> in faith, nothing <span class="accented">doubting</span>, for he that <span class="accented">doubteth</span>," etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.</body></html>
