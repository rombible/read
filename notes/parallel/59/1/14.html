From without come the whispers of Satan, by himself or his legionaries, skilled in all that may entice and delude the unwary soul. And if the doctrine be true that to every one a guardian angel is appointed, so also would seem to be the opposite idea, that each has some demon of the pit watching him incessantly, and commissioned specially for his utter destruction. How terrible must be the skill of such assailants, experienced in the arts which have deceived mankind since the first fatal day. But there is the limit of external power in this matter; the ablest and subtlest fiend can but guess what is passing in its victim's mind, and shape its snares accordingly. God only is the discerner of hearts, and the "spirit of man which is in him" alone, with its Maker, "knoweth the things of a man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.">1Corinthians 2:11</a>). The Holy Spirit "searcheth all things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-10.htm" title="But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.">James 1:10</a>), and all are manifest in His sight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm" title="Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.">Hebrews 4:13</a>), but to no less than His own omniscience. Satan, therefore, can merely act on his general knowledge of human nature, aided by particular guesses at the individual before him, whom he fain would destroy. He has learned too well the deep corruption of the heart, and knows what gaudy bait will most attract the longing and licentious eyes.<p><span class= "bld">Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of </span>(or, <span class= "ital">by</span>)<span class= "bld"> his own lust, and enticed.</span>--Evil humanity thrills responsive as a harp played by a cunning hand; but no power of hell can force its way through the barriers which God the Holy Ghost erects around the faithful and confiding soul: only by treason of the man himself can the great enemy enter in and reign.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14</span> states the true origin of temptation. While the <span class="accented">occasion</span> might be of God "in the order of his providence and of our spiritual training," the <span class="accented">inclination is</span> not of him. Compare with this verse the description of the harlot in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6-27</a>. Here lust is personified, and represented as a seducing harlot, to whose embraces man yields, and the result is the birth of sin, which in its turn gives birth to death. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 It is not every man who suffers, that is blessed; but he who with patience and constancy goes through all difficulties in the way of duty. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.</body></html>
