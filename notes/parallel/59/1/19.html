Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!">James 3:5</a>). And what have we at all to do with wrath, much less that our whole life--as unhappily it often is--should be wasted with such bitterness? Anger, no doubt, is a wholesome tonic for some minds, and certain weaknesses; but "he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-32.htm" title="He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that rules his spirit than he that takes a city.">Proverbs 16:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-27.</span> - EXHORTATION <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> TO HEAR RATHER THAN TO SPEAK, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> NOT ONLY TO HEAR, BUT ALSO TO DO. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The text requires correction.

"<span class="accented">Ye</span> know this, my beloved brethren. But let every man," etc. The verse gives us St. James's version of the proverb, "Speech is silver. Silence is golden." Similar maxims were not infrequent among the Jews. So in Ecclus. 5:11, "<span class="accented">Be</span> swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer;" cf. 4:29, "Be not hasty in thy tongue, and in thy deeds slack and remiss." In the rabbinical work, 'Pirqe Aboth,' 1. 12, we have the following saying of Rabbi Simeon, the son of Gamaliel (who must, therefore, have been a contemporary of St. James): "All my days I have grown up amongst the wise, and have not found ought good for a man but silence; not learning but doing is the groundwork; and whoso multiplies words occasions sin." This passage is curiously like the one before us, both in the thoughts and in the expressions used. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-21 Instead of blaming God under our trials, let us open our ears and hearts to learn what he teaches by them. And if men would govern their tongues, they must govern their passions. The worst thing we can bring to any dispute, is anger. Here is an exhortation to lay apart, and to cast off as a filthy garment, all sinful practices. This must reach to sins of thought and affection, as well as of speech and practice; to every thing corrupt and sinful. We must yield ourselves to the word of God, with humble and teachable minds. Being willing to hear of our faults, taking it not only patiently, but thankfully. It is the design of the word of God to make us wise to salvation; and those who propose any mean or low ends in attending upon it, dishonour the gospel, and disappoint their own souls.</body></html>
