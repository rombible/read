It is again brought forward by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.">1Peter 5:5</a>), and seems to have been a common saying--"a maxim of the wise that had become, as it were, a law of life."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God resisteth the proud.</span> The connection of this with ver. 4 is very close, and is favorable to the view taken above as to the meaning of the first clause of ver. 5, as the words appear to be cited in support of the statement that whosoever would be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. The quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>, LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. St. James's version agrees with this exactly, except that it has <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (the Hebrew has simply "he," ran). The passage is also quoted in precisely the same form by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>), and with <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> by St. Clement of Rome. In St. Peter the quotation is followed by the injunction, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God .... Your adversary <span class="accented">the devil</span>, as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: <span class="accented">whom withstand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) steadfast in the faith." There is clearly a connection between this passage and the one before us in St. James, which proceeds, "Be subject therefore unto God; but <span class="accented">resist the devil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>), and he will flee from you." This passage, it will be felt, is the simpler, and therefore, probably, the earlier of the two (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 Since all wars and fightings come from the corruptions of our own hearts, it is right to mortify those lusts that war in the members. Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow content or satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and the working of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do not abuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heart when prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often ask with wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires beg denials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the language of lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decided warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world. Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion in things of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than lose its friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at all events to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy of God. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, think the Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or does the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature which he creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself by envying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out for ourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches us to be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace of God will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where he gives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proud resist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; in their will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resist the providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud. How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will give more grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray for it are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, ver. 7. Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your wills to the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submit yourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let sinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resisting the devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or, hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfort one who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himself before him.</body></html>
