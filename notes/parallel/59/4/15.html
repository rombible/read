In fact, it is a thing of the past, not of time, but completed action on the part of God--"If the Lord <span class= "ital">have willed</span> it, we shall both live and do this or that." Such is far, be it noted, from Fatalism, in even its best form, as under the teaching of Islam. The sovereignty of God is acknowledged, but with it is plainly recognised the existence of man's free will, dependent, however, on the permission of the Most High for its fleeting duration and power. St. Paul speaks in similar tone of coming to Corinth, "if the Lord will" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-19.htm" title="But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.">1Corinthians 4:19</a>); and "God willing" (D.V.), "the reference of all the contingencies of the future to One supremely wise and loving Will, has been in all ages of Christendom the stay and strength of devout souls."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For that ye ought to say</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">instead of your saying</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, with the infinitive, "saepe apud Graecos" (Grimm). This verse follows in thought on ver. 13, ver. 14 having been parenthetical. "Go to now, ye that say... instead of your saying (as ye ought), If the Lord will," etc. Once more the text requires correction, as the futures <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> should be read (with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B), instead of the subjunctives of the Received Text. It is generally agreed now that the verse should be rendered," If the Lord will, we shall both live and do this or that." But it is possible to divide it differently, and to render as follows: "If the Lord will, and we live, we shall also do this or that." Vulgate, <span class="accented">si Dominus voluerit et si</span> [omit <span class="accented">si</span>, Codex Amiat.] <span class="accented">vixerimus</span>, <span class="accented">faciemus</span>, etc. (cf. Winer, 'Grammar of N.T. Greek,' p. 357). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:11-17 Our lips must be governed by the law of kindness, as well as truth and justice. Christians are brethren. And to break God's commands, is to speak evil of them, and to judge them, as if they laid too great a restraint upon us. We have the law of God, which is a rule to all; let us not presume to set up our own notions and opinions as a rule to those about us, and let us be careful that we be not condemned of the Lord. Go to now, is a call to any one to consider his conduct as being wrong. How apt worldly and contriving men are to leave God out of their plans! How vain it is to look for any thing good without God's blessing and guidance! The frailty, shortness, and uncertainty of life, ought to check the vanity and presumptuous confidence of all projects for futurity. We can fix the hour and minute of the sun's rising and setting to-morrow, but we cannot fix the certain time of a vapour being scattered. So short, unreal, and fading is human life, and all the prosperity or enjoyment that attends it; though bliss or woe for ever must be according to our conduct during this fleeting moment. We are always to depend on the will of God. Our times are not in our own hands, but at the disposal of God. Our heads may be filled with cares and contrivances for ourselves, or our families, or our friends; but Providence often throws our plans into confusion. All we design, and all we do, should be with submissive dependence on God. It is foolish, and it is hurtful, to boast of worldly things and aspiring projects; it will bring great disappointment, and will prove destruction in the end. Omissions are sins which will be brought into judgment, as well as commissions. He that does not the good he knows should be done, as well as he who does the evil he knows should not be done, will be condemned. Oh that we were as careful not to omit prayer, and not to neglect to meditate and examine our consciences, as we are not to commit gross outward vices against light!</body></html>
