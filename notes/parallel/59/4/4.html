Renunciation of the world, in the Christian promise, is not forsaking it when tired and clogged with its delights, but the earliest severance from it; to break this vow, or not to have made it, is to belong to the foes of God, and not merely to be out of covenant with Him. The forces of good and evil divide the land so sharply that there is no debatable ground, nor even halting-place between. And if God be just, so also is He jealous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>).<p>"Let us not weakly slide into the treason:<p>Yielding another what we owe to Him."<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever therefore will be</span> (or, <span class= "ital">wills to be</span>) <span class= "bld">a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</span>--The choice is open; here is no iron fate, no dread necessity: but the wrong determination of the soul constitutes it henceforth as an ally of Satan. "Woe unto you, when all men speak well of you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-26.htm" title="Woe to you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.">Luke 6:26</a>), for the world, as our Lord has taught us, must "love its own" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-19.htm" title="If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.">John 15:19</a>). And the sooner the soldier of Christ learns to expect its animosity, the better will he give himself up to the battle. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.

Omit <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B. The Vulgate has simply <span class="accented">adulteri</span>; the Old Latin (ff), <span class="accented">fornicatores.</span> Similarly the Syriae. Very strange is this sudden exclamation, "<span class="accented">ye</span> adulteresses!" and very difficult to explain. The same word (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) is used as a feminine adjective by our Lord in the expression, "<span class="accented">an</span> evil and adulterous generation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>); and in this possibly lies the explanation of St. James's use of the term. More probably, however, it should be accounted for as a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-45.htm">Ezekiel 23:45</a>, where we read of Samaria and Jerusalem under the titles of Aholah and Aholibah: "The righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; <span class="accented">because they are adulteresses</span>, and blood is in their <span class="accented">hands."</span> It is remarkable too that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a> the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, although the Hebrew has the masculine, and <span class="accented">men</span> are evidently referred to. If, then, in the Old Testament the Jewish communities were personified as adulteresses, it is not unnatural for St. James to transfer the epithet to those Judaeo-Christian communities to which he was writing; and the word should probably be taken, just as in the Old Testament, of spiritual fornication, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apostasy from God, shown in this case, not by actual idolatry, but by that "<span class="accented">friendship</span> of the world" which is "enmity with God," and by "<span class="accented">covetous</span>ness which is idolatry." <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The word occurs here only in the New Testament. With the thought of this verse, compare our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18, 19</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 Since all wars and fightings come from the corruptions of our own hearts, it is right to mortify those lusts that war in the members. Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow content or satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and the working of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do not abuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heart when prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often ask with wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires beg denials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the language of lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decided warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world. Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion in things of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than lose its friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at all events to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy of God. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, think the Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or does the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature which he creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself by envying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out for ourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches us to be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace of God will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where he gives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proud resist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; in their will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resist the providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud. How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will give more grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray for it are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, ver. 7. Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your wills to the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submit yourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let sinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resisting the devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or, hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfort one who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himself before him.</body></html>
