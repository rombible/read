The perfect peace above, capable, moreover, in some ways, of commencement here below, dwelt upon at the close of James 3, has by inevitable reaction led the Apostle to speak suddenly, almost fiercely, of the existing state of things. He traces the conflict raging around him to the fount and origin of evil within.<p><span class= "bld">Come they not . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">come they not hence, even from your lusts warring in your members</span>? The term is really <span class= "ital">pleasures, </span>but in an evil sense, and therefore "lusts." "The desires of various sorts of pleasures are," says Bishop Moberly, "like soldiers in the devil's army, posted and picketed all over us, in the hope of winning our members, and so ourselves, back to his allegiance, which we have renounced in our baptism." St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>) thus writes in the same strain of "fleshly lusts, which war against the soul"; and St. Paul knew also of this bitter strife in man, if not actually in himself, and could "see another law" in his members--the natural tendency of the flesh--"warring against the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin which is in his members" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>). See also Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>.<p>Happily the Christian philosopher understands this; and with the very cry of wretchedness, "Who shall deliver me?" can answer, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24-25</a>). But the burden of this hateful depravity drove of old men like Lucretius to suicide rather than endurance; and its mantle of despair is on all the religions of India at the present time--matter itself being held to be evil, and eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - REBUKE OF QUARRELS ARISING FROM PRIDE AND GREED.

There is then no need to seek an explanation of the passage in the outbreaks and insurrections which were so painfully common among the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Lusts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); R.V., "pleasures." "An unusual sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, hardly distinguishable from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in fact taken up by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (Alford). With the expression, "that war in your members," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, "<span class="accented">Abstain</span> from fleshly lusts which war against the soul." Ver. <span class="cmt_sub_title">2 gives us an insight into the terrible difficulties with which the apostles</span> had to contend. Those to whom St. James was writing were guilty of lust, which actually led to murder. So the charge in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-15.htm">1 Peter 4:15</a> evidently presupposes the possibility of a professing Christian suffering as a murderer or thief. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kill</span>. The marginal rendering "<span class="accented">envy"</span> supplies a remarkable instance of a false reading once widely adopted, although resting simply on conjecture. There is no variation in the manuscripts or ancient versions. All alike have <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But, owing to the startling character of the expression in an address to Christians, Erasmus suggested that perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye envy," was the original reading, and actually inserted it in the second edition of his Greek Testament (1519). In his third edition (1522) he wisely returned to the true reading, although, strangely enough, he retained the false one, "<span class="accented">invidetis</span>," in his Latin version, whence it passed into that of Beza and others. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> appears, however, in a few later editions, e.g. three editions published at Basle, 1524 (Bebelius), 1546 (Herwagius), and 1553 (Beyling), in that of Henry Stephens, 1576; and even so late as 1705 is found in an edition of Oritius. In England the reading obtained a wide currency, being actually adopted in all the versions in general use previous to that of 1611, viz. those of Tyndale, Coverdale, Taverner, the Bishops Bible, and the Geneva Version. The Authorized Version relegated it to the margin, from which it has been happily excluded by the Revisers, and thus, it is to be hoped, it has finally disappeared. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kill, and desire to have.</span> The combination is certainly strange. Dean Scott sees in the terms a possible allusion to "the well-known politico-religious party of the zealots," and <span class="accented">suggests</span> the rendering, "<span class="accented">ye</span> play the murderers and zealots." It is, perhaps, more probable that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> simply refers to covetousness; cf. the use of the word (although with a better meaning) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1, 39</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 Since all wars and fightings come from the corruptions of our own hearts, it is right to mortify those lusts that war in the members. Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow content or satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and the working of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do not abuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heart when prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often ask with wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires beg denials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the language of lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decided warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world. Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion in things of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than lose its friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at all events to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy of God. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, think the Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or does the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature which he creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself by envying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out for ourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches us to be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace of God will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where he gives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proud resist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; in their will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resist the providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud. How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will give more grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray for it are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, ver. 7. Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your wills to the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submit yourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let sinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resisting the devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or, hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfort one who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himself before him.</body></html>
