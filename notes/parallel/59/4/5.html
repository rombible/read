It were well that the unfaithful, addressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>, should bear the general sentiment of this verse in mind, and not fancy such warnings of holy writ were uttered <span class= "ital">emptily, in vain.</span><p>Many commentators have been puzzled to say whence the words came which are quoted as authoritative by St. James. Surely the substance was sufficient for him, as for other inspired writers, without a slavish adherence to the form: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a> for the inbreathing of the Spirit, with any such chapter as Deuteronomy 32 for His jealous inquisition. It must, however, be noted that a slightly varied punctuation of the verse will give quite another sense to its questioning. (See Wordsworth.) <span class= "ital">Suppose ye that the Scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the Spirit, which took up His abode in you, lust to envy?</span> And defensible or not as this translation may be, at least it escapes some of the difficulties of the foregoing. (Exhaustive notes, with references to most authorities, are in Alford; or an easy summary of the matter may be read in Plumptre's <span class= "ital">St. James.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - The difficulty of the passage is well shown by the hesitation of the Revisers. The first clause is rendered, "<span class="accented">Or</span> think ye that the Scripture speaketh in vain?" but as an alternative there is suggested in the margin, "Or think ye that the Scripture saith in vain?" as if the following clause were a quotation from Scripture. And of this following clause three possible renderings are suggested. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">In the text</span>: "Doth the Spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying? But he giveth more grace.

But he giveth," etc. Further, it is noted in the margin that some ancient authorities read "dwelleth in us," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which is the reading of the Received Text, and so of the A.V. resting upon K, L; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and B being the primary authorities for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. With regard to the first clause, the rendering of the R.V., "speaketh," may be justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>. It is possible that St. James was intending to quote <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a> immediately, but after the introductory formula, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, he interposes with the emphatic question, "Is it to <span class="accented">envy</span>," etc.? and does not arrive at the quotation till ver. 6, when he introduces it with a fresh formula of quotation, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, a looseness of construction which is quite natural in a Hebrew. Other views, for which it is believed there is less to be urged, are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., are a quotation from some (now lost) early Christian writing. On this view the passage is parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>, where a portion of a Christian hymn is introduced by the words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That St. James is referring to the general drift rather than to the exact words of several passages of the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10, 19</a>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That the allusion is to some passage of the New Testament, either <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, etc. Passing on to the translation of the second clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., it must be noted that <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is never used elsewhere in the New Testament or in the LXX. (Wisd. 6:25; 1 Macc. 8:16) or in the apostolic Fathers except in a bad sense. True that <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a> teaches us that God is a "<span class="accented">jealous God</span>," but there the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span> by the far nobler word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. Wolf, 'Curae Philippians Crit.,' p. 64, where it is noted that, while <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is <span class="accented">a vex media</span>, the same cannot be said of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which is always <span class="accented">vitiosa</span>, and is never used by the LXX. <span class="accented">ubi vox Hebraica</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5ea;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5de;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5e6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5da;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span> This seems to be a fatal objection to the marginal readings of the Revised Version, and to compel us to rest content with that adopted in the text, "Doth the Spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?" or rather, "Is it to <span class="accented">envying</span> that the Spirit... longs?" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> being placed for emphasis at the beginning of the sentence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 Since all wars and fightings come from the corruptions of our own hearts, it is right to mortify those lusts that war in the members. Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow content or satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and the working of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do not abuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heart when prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often ask with wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires beg denials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the language of lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decided warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world. Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion in things of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than lose its friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at all events to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy of God. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, think the Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or does the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature which he creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself by envying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out for ourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches us to be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace of God will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where he gives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proud resist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; in their will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resist the providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud. How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will give more grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray for it are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, ver. 7. Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your wills to the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submit yourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on the whole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Let sinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resisting the devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or, hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfort one who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himself before him.</body></html>
