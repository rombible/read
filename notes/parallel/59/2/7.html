"Into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>) had all been baptised who were thus addressed; but most probably the Second Person of the Trinity is referred to here. And it was the scorn and contempt visited upon His Name, which changed the mere abuse and ribaldry into a perilous likeness to the deadliest sin. Most commentators thus restrict the Name here to that of Christ. If their view be correct, the blasphemy would probably be linked with that epithet of "Christian"--then so dishonourable--coined, we are told, first in Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>). But there were far more insulting terms found for the poor and struggling believer--"Nazarene," "Atheist," and even worse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That worthy Name</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">the honorable Name</span>; probably the Name of Christ, by which the disciples were known (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>), and for which they suffered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-14.htm">1 Peter 5:14</a>-16). <span class="cmt_word">By the which ye are called</span>; literally, <span class="accented">which was called upon you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>). A similar expression is found in St. James's speech in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-17.htm">Acts 15:17</a>, in a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.</body></html>
