The pitiless are usually cowards, and may well be moved by fear, if they will not by love: "I will repay, saith the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</span>--There can hardly be a fitter comment on this text than that which must be present in every reader's mind--the speech of Portia in <span class= "ital">The Merchant of Venice, </span><p>"The quality of mercy is not strained;" &c.<p>--(Acts 4 scene 1.)<p>But let the words of the Greek, John the Golden Mouthed, be added, for their exceeding beauty also. "Mercy is dear to God, and intercedes for the sinner, and breaks his chains, and dissipates the darkness, and quenches the fire of hell, and destroys the worm, and rescues from the gnashing of teeth. To her the gates of Heaven are opened. She is the queen of virtues, and makes men like to God, for it is written, 'Be ye merciful as your Father also is merciful' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-36.htm" title="Be you therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.">Luke 6:36</a>). She has silver wings like the dove, and feathers of gold, and soars aloft, and is clothed with divine glory, and stands by the throne of God; when we are in danger of being condemned she rises up and pleads for us, and covers us with her defence, and enfolds us in her wings. God loves mercy more than sacrifice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - A clear reminiscence of our Lord's teaching in the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1</a>, etc.; Matthew 5:7): <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is certainly the right form of the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, K), not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (Receptus with L), and the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> of the Textus Receptus is entirely wanting in manuscript authority, and should be deleted. The subject is ended by the abrupt declaration, almost like a cry of triumph, "Mercy glorieth against judgment." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.</body></html>
