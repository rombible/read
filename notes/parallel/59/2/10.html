The Law was express on the need of keeping <span class="accented">all</span> the commandments; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-37.htm">Leviticus 19:37</a> (the same chapter to which St. James has already referred), <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He is guilty of all.</span> The very same thought is found in rabbinical writers (Talmud, 'Schabbath,' fol. 70); a saying of R. Johanan: "Quodsi racist omnia unum vero omitter omnium est singulorum reus." Other passages to the same effect may be seen in Schottgen, 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. 1. p. 1017, etc.; and cf., 'Pirqe Aboth,' 4:15. Was it a false inference from St. James's teaching in this verso that led the Judaizers of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. to lay down the law "<span class="accented">Except</span> ye be circumcised after the customs of Moses ye cannot be saved"? "<span class="accented">Whosoever</span> shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of <span class="accented">all</span>," might seem to suggest such an inference: "<span class="accented">To</span> whom," says St. James himself, "<span class="accented">we</span> gave no commandment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm">Acts 15:24</a>). (On the teaching of this tenth verse there is an interesting letter of Augustine's to Jerome, which well repays study: 'Ep.' 167.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.</body></html>
