(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm" title="These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.">Jude 1:16</a>.) The lesson is distinctly addressed to believers, and its severity appears to be caused by the Apostle's unhappy consciousness of its need. What were endurable in a heathen, or an alien, or even a Jew, ceased to be so in a professed follower of the lowly Jesus. And this seems to be a further reason for the indignant expostulation and condemnation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">James 2:14</a>. Thus the whole chapter may really be considered as dealing with Faith; and it flows naturally from the foregoing thoughts upon Religion--or, as we interpreted their subject-matter, Religious Service.<p><span class= "bld">Have</span> (or, <span class= "ital">hold</span>) <span class= "bld">not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with (or, <span class= "ital">in</span>) respect of persons.</span>--"Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ," wrote St. Paul to the proud and wealthy men of Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.">2Corinthians 8:9</a>), "that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich;" and, with more cogent an appeal, to the Philippians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/2-4.htm" title="Are you not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?">James 2:4-7</a>), "In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves: look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: <span class= "ital">Who, being in the form of God"</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Very God, and not appearance merely--nevertheless "<span class= "ital">thought not His equality with God a thing to be always grasped at,"</span> as it were some booty or prize, "<span class= "ital">but emptied Himself</span>" of His glory, "<span class= "ital">and took upon Him the shape of a slave."</span> Were these central, nay initial, facts of the faith believed then; or are they now? If they were in truth, how could there be such folly and shame as "acceptance of persons" according to the dictates of fashionable society and the world? "Honour," indeed, "to whom honour" is due (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-7.htm" title="Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.">Romans 13:7</a>). The Christian religion allows not that contempt for even earthly dignities--affected by some of her followers, but springing more from envy and unruliness than aught besides. True reverence and submission are in no way condemned by this scripture: but their excess and gross extreme, the preference for vulgar wealth, the adulation of success, the worship, in short, of some new golden calf.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - WARNING AGAINST RESPECT OF PERSONS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The translation is doubtful, two renderings being possible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That of the A.V. and R.V., "Hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of the R.V. margin and Westcott and Hort, "Do ye, in accepting persons, hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory?"

"The faith" here may be either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> objective (<span class="accented">tides quae creditur</span>), as in the Epistle of St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3, 20</a>; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> subjective (<span class="accented">tides qua creditur</span>), "Have the faith which believes in," etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Our Lord Jesus Christ</span>. Exactly the same title occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-26.htm">Acts 15:26</a>, in the letter written from the Apostolic Council to the Syrian Churches - a letter which was probably drawn up by St. James himself. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord of glory</span>. The same title is given to our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>, and seems to be founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7</a>, etc. The genitive, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, must depend on <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in spite of the intervening <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. Similar trajections occur elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> depend, on <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and, according to a <span class="accented">possible</span> view, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a> (see Hort's 'Greek Testament,' vol. 2, appendix, p. 56). Bengel's view, that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is in apposition with <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> can scarcely be maintained, in the absence of any parallel expression elsewhere. Respect of persons (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) literally, <span class="accented">reception</span> of <span class="accented">faces.</span> The substantive is found here and three times in St. Paul's Epistles - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>; the verb (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) only here in ver. 9; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-31.htm">Acts 10:31</a>. None of them occur in the LXX., where, however, we find <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-9.htm">Malachi 2:9</a>, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-21.htm">Luke 20:21</a>), for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Bishop Lightfoot has pointed out ('Galatians,' p. 108) that, in the Old Testament, the expression is a neutral one, not necessarily involving any idea of partiality, and more often used in a good than in a bad sense. "When it becomes an independent Greek phrase, however, the bad sense attaches to <span class="accented">it</span>, owing to the secondary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as a mask,' so that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> signifies 'to regard the external circumstances of a man' - his rank, wealth, etc. - as opposed to his real intrinsic character. Thus in the New Testament it has always a bad sense." It is exactly this <span class="accented">regard to external circumstances</span> against which St. James is warning his readers; and the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ had himself been known, when on earth, as no respecter of persons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-21.htm">Luke 20:21</a>), would give point to his warning. The plural (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is perhaps used to include the different kinds of manifestations of the sin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.</body></html>
