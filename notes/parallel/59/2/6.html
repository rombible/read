No body of laws could on the whole be more equitable than the Roman, but their administration in the provinces was frequently in venal hands; and besides, the large fees demanded by the <span class= "ital">juris-consulti</span>--"the learned in the law"--quite barred the way of the poorer suitors, such as, for the most part, were the Christians to whom this Letter was written.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - You have dishonored by your treatment the poor man, whom God chose; while those rich men to whom ye pay such honor are just the very persons who <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> oppress you and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> blaspheme God and Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Poor... rich.</span> In the Old Testament we occasionally find the term "poor" parallel to "righteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>); and "<span class="accented">rich"</span> to "wicked" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). St. James's use here is somewhat similar (see on James 1:9, etc.). "Christiani multi ex pauperibus erant: pauci ex divitibus" (Bengel). The "rich men" here alluded to are evidently such as was the Apostle Paul before his conversion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They dragged the poor Christians before the judgment-seat (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). So Saul, "haling (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) men and women, committed them to prison" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They blasphemed the honorable Name by which Christians were called. So Saul thought that he ought to do many things contrary to the <span class="accented">Name</span> of Jesus of Nazareth, and strove to make them blaspheme (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-9.htm">Acts 26:9-11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> All this they did <span class="accented">in person</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); "themselves," just as Saul did. No difficulty need be felt about the presence of these rich men in the synagogues of the Christians (see Introduction, p. 8.). It will be noticed that St. James <span class="accented">never</span> calls them "<span class="accented">brethren."</span> Further, it must be remembered that, at this early date, the Church had not yet learnt by bitter experience the need for that secrecy with which in later days she shrouded her worship. At this time the Christian assemblies were open to any who chose to find their way in. All were welcome, as we see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm">1 Corinthians 14:23</a>, etc., where the chance entry of "<span class="accented">men</span> unlearned or unbelieving" is contemplated as likely to happen. Hence there is no sort of difficulty in the presence of the "rich man" here, who might be eagerly welcomed, and repay his welcome by dragging them to the judgment-seat. <span class="cmt_word">Draw you before the judgment-seats.</span> The account given by Josephus of the death of St, James himself affords a good illustration of the manner in which Christians were liable to this (see Introduction, p. 6.). But the tribunals need not be confined to Jewish ones. Other instances of similar treatment, illustrating the thoughts and language of the passage before us, may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>. Litigation of an entirely different character between Christians themselves is alluded to and condemned by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6.htm">1 Corinthians 6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.</body></html>
