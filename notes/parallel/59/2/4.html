Did you not lose the idea of brotherhood, and become contentious as to supremacy of self and place--serving yourselves while prepared for the service of Christ? The Lord Jesus thought not His equality with God a thing ever to be grasped at, if work for man could be done by self-humiliation. Therefore, although being 'equal to the Father, as touching His Godhead,' He became 'inferior . . . as touching His Manhood.' And none may turn unmoved from that picture of sublime condescension to the petty strifes of quality and position which profane the Christian sanctuary. Most sadly true is it that in making distinctions such as these between rich and poor, we 'become of the number of those who doubt respecting their faith;' for, while it abolishes such altogether in the presence of God, we set them up of our own arrogance and pride. 'We draw nigh unto Him with our mouth, and honour Him with our lips, but our heart is far from Him; and our worship therefore vain.'" (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-31.htm" title="And they come to you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness.">Ezekiel 33:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-8.htm" title="This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.">Matthew 15:8-9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The copula (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) of the Received Text is certainly spurious. It is found in K, L, but is wanting in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic. B also omits the negative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> (so Westcott and Herr margin). If this manuscript is followed, the sentence must be read as a direct statement, and not as interrogative. But if (with most manuscripts and editions) the interrogative be retained, the translation is still doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> may mean: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Are ye not divided in your own mind?" so the Syriac and R.V., which would imply that this respect of persons showed that they were halting between God and the world - in fact, double-minded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Do ye not make distinctions among yourselves?" R.V. margin; this gives an excellent sense, but is wanting in authority, as there appears to be no other instance forthcoming of the passive with this meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Did you not doubt among yourselves?" this (doubt) is the almost invariable meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the New Testament, and the word has already been used in this sense by St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>). Hence this rendering is to be preferred. So Huther, Plumptre, and Farrar, the latter of whom explains the passage as follows: "It shows <span class="accented">doubt to</span> act as though Christ had never promised his kingdom to the poor, rich in faith; and <span class="accented">wicked reasonings</span> to argue mentally that the poor <span class="accented">must</span> be less worthy of honor than the rich." Judges of evil thoughts (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">sc.</span> their own (thoughts), which caused them to respect persons. Thus the phrase is equivalent to "evil-thinking judges." (On the genitive, see Winer, 'Gram. of N. T. Greek,' p. 233; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.</body></html>
