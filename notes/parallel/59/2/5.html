It were folly to deny it. But this passage, like so many others, gives the reason for that choice. "The poor of this world" are His chosen; not merely for their poverty, although it may have been the air, so to speak, in which the virtues which endeared them to Him have flourished most. And these are rich for present and for future. They know Him "now by faith," and "after this life have the fruition of His glorious Godhead." "Blessed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>). The way thereto for them is nearer and less cumbered than for the rich, if only they fulfil the Scripture (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-3.htm" title="But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:">Matthew 6:3</a>), and be poor "in spirit:" then, indeed, are they "heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him." The world must always measure by its own standard, and consider poverty a curse, just as it looks on pain and trouble as evil. But the teaching of God, declared most eloquently in the life of His blessed Son, is the direct opposite to this. In a worship which demands of its votaries costly gifts and offerings--and every religion tends downwards to such desires--the rich man has a golden pavement to his future bliss. No wonder, therefore, that again and again the voice of the Spirit of God has pointed out the narrow way, and the eternal excellency of truth, and faith, and love, the riches easiest of acquisition by the poor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> <span class="accented">- Proof of the sinfulness of respect of persons.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). This has been noticed as a coincidence with the speech of St. James in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>. It is, however, too slight to be worth much (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1</a>).

These God chose (to be) rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom</span>; mentioned here only by St. James (and even here, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); cf. <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">Which he hath promised.</span> As Dean Plumptre has pointed out, "it is scarcely possible to exclude a direct reference to the words of Christ, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-31.htm">Luke 12:31, 32</a>; and so we get indirect proof of a current knowledge, at the early period at which St. James wrote, of teaching which was afterwards recorded in the written Gospels." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must not respect persons on account of mere outward circumstances and appearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of being disciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.</body></html>
