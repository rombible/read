Some copies have a word which means idle, fruitless, workless, in place of that translated "dead"; but the sense is the same either way. "If," says Bishop Beveridge, "I see fruit growing upon a tree, I know what tree it is upon which such fruit grows. And so, if I saw how a man lives, I know how he believes. If his faith be good, his works cannot but be good too; and if his works be bad, his faith cannot but be bad too: for, wheresoever there is a justifying faith, there are also good works; and wheresoever there are no good works, there is no justifying faith." Works are the natural fruit of faith; and without them it is evident the tree is dead, perhaps at the very roots, ready to be cut down and cast into the fire.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-24.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Third point</span>: Proof from the example of Abraham that a man is justified by works and not by faith only. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a> we read of Abraham that "he believed in the Lord; and he accounted it to him for righteousness" (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, quoted by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6</a>). But years after this we find that God "tested Abraham" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>). To this trial St. James refers as that by which Abraham's faith was "perfected" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>), and by which the saying of earlier years found a more complete realization (cf. Ecclus. 44:20, 21, "Abraham... kept the Law of the Most High, and was in covenant with him... and when he was proved, he was found faithful. Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed," etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Faith without works is dead</span>. The Received Text, followed by the A.V., reads <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, C3, K, L, Syriac, Vulgate (Clementine). The Revisers, following B, C1, if, read <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>, "barren" (so Vulgate Amiat. by a correction, <span class="accented">otiosa</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-26 Those are wrong who put a mere notional belief of the gospel for the whole of evangelical religion, as many now do. No doubt, true faith alone, whereby men have part in Christ's righteousness, atonement, and grace, saves their souls; but it produces holy fruits, and is shown to be real by its effect on their works; while mere assent to any form of doctrine, or mere historical belief of any facts, wholly differs from this saving faith. A bare profession may gain the good opinion of pious people; and it may procure, in some cases, worldly good things; but what profit will it be, for any to gain the whole world, and to lose their souls? Can this faith save him? All things should be accounted profitable or unprofitable to us, as they tend to forward or hinder the salvation of our souls. This place of Scripture plainly shows that an opinion, or assent to the gospel, without works, is not faith. There is no way to show we really believe in Christ, but by being diligent in good works, from gospel motives, and for gospel purposes. Men may boast to others, and be conceited of that which they really have not. There is not only to be assent in faith, but consent; not only an assent to the truth of the word, but a consent to take Christ. True believing is not an act of the understanding only, but a work of the whole heart. That a justifying faith cannot be without works, is shown from two examples, Abraham and Rahab. Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. Faith, producing such works, advanced him to peculiar favours. We see then, ver. 24, how that by works a man is justified, not by a bare opinion or profession, or believing without obeying; but by having such faith as produces good works. And to have to deny his own reason, affections, and interests, is an action fit to try a believer. Observe here, the wonderful power of faith in changing sinners. Rahab's conduct proved her faith to be living, or having power; it showed that she believed with her heart, not merely by an assent of the understanding. Let us then take heed, for the best works, without faith, are dead; they want root and principle. By faith any thing we do is really good; as done in obedience to God, and aiming at his acceptance: the root is as though it were dead, when there is no fruit. Faith is the root, good works are the fruits; and we must see to it that we have both. This is the grace of God wherein we stand, and we should stand to it. There is no middle state. Every one must either live God's friend, or God's enemy. Living to God, as it is the consequence of faith, which justifies and will save, obliges us to do nothing against him, but every thing for him and to him.</body></html>
