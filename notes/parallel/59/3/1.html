The condemnation is of those who appoint themselves, and are as "blind leaders of the blind" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-14.htm" title="Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.">Matthew 15:14</a>). No man had a right to exercise the sacred functions of the appointed masters in Israel (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a master of Israel, and know not these things?">John 3:10</a>), and none might take the honour of the priesthood unto himself, "but he that was called of God, as was Aaron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-4.htm" title="And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.">Hebrews 5:4</a>). Whereas we know from our Lord's own words that the Scribes and Pharisees loved respectful "greetings in the markets, and to be called of men 'Rabbi, Rabbi'" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-1.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,">Matthew 23:1-12</a>). Nevertheless His disciples were not to be acknowledged thus: for "one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren." The neglect of this wholesome caution perplexed the early Church, as much as the later branches thereof. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation.

Nay--"who is sufficient for these things?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2Corinthians 2:6</a>.) The test of all ministry must come at last in the day of trial and fiery inquisition of God; this and not the world's opinion will be the real approval (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-11.htm" title="For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.">1Corinthians 3:11-15</a>). If the work of any teacher abide. his reward will be exceeding great; if it "be burned," woe to him! "He himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire," scathed by that which shall consume the rubbish he has raked together; the faith which prompted such a man shall save him, but no reward can follow useless teaching; nor can there be escape for his own soul, except he wrought honestly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - WARNING AGAINST OVER-READINESS TO TEACH, LEADING TO A DISCOURSE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT OF THE TONGUE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Warning</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Be not many teachers</span>.

The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.</body></html>
