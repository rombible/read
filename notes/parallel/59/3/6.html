"</span>The course of Nature" is literally the "wheel," the "orb of creation." The Jewish word for the place of torment, the accursed side of Hades, should be thus preserved: whence it was that the rich man of the parable prayed for water to cool his tongue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-24.htm" title="And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.">Luke 16:24</a>).<p>"Speech is silver; silence, gold." But even the Christian world will not endure overmuch the godly discipline of silence. Three temptations "to smite with the tongue" are specially powerful of evil: viz., as a relief from passion, as a gratification of spite, as revenge for wrong. The first is experienced by hot tempered folk; the second yielded to by the malicious; the third welcomed by the otherwise weak and defenceless; and all of us at times are in each of these divisions. Then, again, there are the "foolish talkings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-4.htm" title="Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.">Ephesians 5:4</a>), and worse, the jestings at holy things, and misquotations of Scripture: all to be avoided as not becoming saints. If then we would "walk in love" we must curb the tongue; but, better still, strive to cleanse the heart, and so be quite determined that nothing shall go forth but words of meekness and affection. Nay, if we be truly Christ's, though "reviled" by the unruly tongues of others, we shall, like Him, "revile not again" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a>). And as the whole body is the Lord's to be sanctified to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>so particularly must the tongue be kept from "evil-speaking, lying, and slandering," and used rightly for the service of God. Thus may we truly offer "the calves of our lips" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm" title="Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say to him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.">Hosea 14:2</a>), more acceptable than the blood of victims slain on a thousand altars, "than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-23.htm" title="In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.">Mark 12:23</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented"> - Application of illustration</span> The translation is doubtful, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of the Received Text must certainly be deleted.

A fourth rendering, which is wholly untenable, deserves notice for its antiquity, viz. that of the Syriac, "The tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity (is the forest)." <span class="cmt_word">The world of iniquity</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The tongue is thus characterized, because it leads to and embraces all kinds of wickednesses. As Bishop Wordsworth points out, it contains within itself the elements of all mischief. A somewhat similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is found in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "The whole world of wealth is for the faithful: for the faithless not a penny." <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: "is set" or "<span class="accented">has</span> its place," and so simply "<span class="accented">is."</span> The tongue <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> defiles the whole body, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> sets on fire <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the wheel of birth" or "of nature" - a very strange expression, and one almost without parallel. (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> only here in the New Testament. There is, however, no doubt about its meaning "wheel." The A.V., which took it as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "course," is universally given up (see Winer, 'Gram. of N. T.,' p. 62). For <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23</a>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">retain nativitatis nostrae.</span>) Alford translates the phrase, "the orb of the creation," and in favor of this the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77.htm">Psalm 77</a>. (76.) 19 may be appealed to. But more natural is the interpretation of Dean Plumptre, who takes it as "a figure for the whole of life from birth, the wheel which then begins to roll on its course and continues rolling until death." So Huther and Dean Scott in the ' Speaker's Commentary.' This view has the support of the Syriac Version: "The course of our generations which run as a wheel;" and is implied in the (false) reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, (compare the Vulgate). It should also be noticed that life is compared to a wheel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And is set on fire.</span> The tongue has already been called a fire. It is now shown how that fire is kindled - kern beneath, kern Gehenna. A similar expression is found in the Targum on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a>, "Lingua dolosa ... cum carbonibus juniperi, qui incensi sunt in Gehenna interne." Gehenna, here personified, is mentioned also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22, 29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-9.htm">Matthew 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43, 45, 47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-5.htm">Luke 12:5</a>. Thus the passage before us is the <span class="accented">only one</span> in the New Testament where the word is used except, by our Lord himself. The word itself is simply a Graecised form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "<span class="accented">valley</span> of <span class="accented">Hinnom</span>," or fully, "<span class="accented">valley</span> of the sons of Hinnom" (variously rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>). This valley, from its associations, became a type of hell; and hence its name was taken by the Jews to denote the place of torment. In this sense it occurs in the New Testament, and frequently in Jewish writings (see Buxtorf, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub verb.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), and it is said that the later rabbis actually fixed upon this valley as the mouth of hell. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-12 We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils. The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.</body></html>
