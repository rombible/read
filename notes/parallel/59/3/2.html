The very human weakness of Peter, and Paul, and James, endears them to us; for so we know assuredly that they were "men of like passions" with ourselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm" title="And saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:">Acts 14:15</a>), and, where they succeeded, we, by the like grace of God, may also win the crown.<p><span class= "bld">If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man.</span>--If <span class= "ital">any</span> man: much more one who fain would teach his fellows. To "offend" means to stumble over something, and fall, and in this sense we get the exact meaning of "offending" by an unguarded allusion to a subject painful in the mind of another. "A constant governance of our speech, according to duty and reason, is a high instance, and a special argument of a thoroughly sincere and solid goodness," says Isaac Barrow; but the meekest of men failed once, and blessed indeed is he who takes heed to his ways that he sins not with his tongue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm" title="I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.">Psalm 39:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Able also to bridle the whole body.</span>--Not that if the tongue be stilled all the members of the body are consequently in peace; but, because the work of ruling the one rebel is so great, that a much less corresponding effort will keep the others in subjection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> gives the reason for this <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. We shall be judged because in many things we all stumble, and it is implied that teachers are in danger of greater condemnation, because it is almost impossible to govern the tongue completely. With the thought comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>, "There is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> is adverbial, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>, and may be either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "in many things," or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "oft." <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>.

"Control of speech is named, not as in itself constituting perfection, but as a crucial test indicating whether the man has or has not attained unto it" (Plumptre). <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-4.htm">James 1:4</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>). It is only found in these two passages; never in the LXX. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-12 We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils. The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.</body></html>
