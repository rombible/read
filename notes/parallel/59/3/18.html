Their fruit is hidden in the precious seed, but "the times of refreshing shall come," and the glorious plant bring forth her flower, and bear the golden fruit for the blessed ones to eat in the fadeless paradise of God. As "whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.">Galatians 6:7</a>)--here is a harvest laid up for the righteous to enjoy for ever; and (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm" title="Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them which are exercised thereby.">Hebrews 12:11</a>) God's chastening of the truly penitent yields with it a like promise afterwards of "the peaceable fruit of righteousness"--so, in the tender mercy of our Saviour, "they that sow in tears shall reap in joy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-6.htm" title="He that goes forth and weeps, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.">Psalm 126:6</a>).

He who thinks well, or he who talks well, is not wise in the sense of the Scripture, if he does not live and act well. True wisdom may be know by the meekness of the spirit and temper. Those who live in malice, envy, and contention, live in confusion; and are liable to be provoked and hurried to any evil work. Such wisdom comes not down from above, but springs up from earthly principles, acts on earthly motives, and is intent on serving earthly purposes. Those who are lifted up with such wisdom, described by the apostle James, is near to the Christian love, described by the apostle Paul; and both are so described that every man may fully prove the reality of his attainments in them. It has no disguise or deceit. It cannot fall in with those managements the world counts wise, which are crafty and guileful; but it is sincere, and open, and steady, and uniform, and consistent with itself. May the purity, peace, gentleness, teachableness, and mercy shown in all our actions, and the fruits of righteousness abounding in our lives, prove that God has bestowed upon us this excellent gift.</body></html>
