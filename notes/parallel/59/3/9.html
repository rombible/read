In the first clause we should read <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, Coptic, Syriac, ff, and some manuscripts of the Vulgate) for <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (Receptus, with K, L, and Vulgate). <span class="cmt_word">Made after the similitude of God</span>; better, <span class="accented">likeness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>).

Theologically they are important, as showing that the "likeness of God" in man (in whatever it may consist) was not entirely obliterated by the Fall. St. James's words would be meaningless if only Adam had been created in the image and likeness of God. So St. Paul speaks of fallen man as still "the image (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>) and glory of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-12 We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils. The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.</body></html>
