If there be wrath laid up in store for the oppressor, great is the coming peace of the oppressed.<p><span class= "bld">The husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it . . . Be ye also patient</span>.--It becomes you, the just, to bear with the unjust till God work the end of your trial, and prove them at the same time. Again and again, through several verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">James 5:7-11</a>), St. James repeats his advice, emphasising it with various reasons: the nearness of deliverance; the Judge standing at the gate; the example of the prophets--persecuted by men, and therefore blessed of God; the hope of those who endure--Job for example: the very faithfulness and tender mercy of the Lord, bringing all things to a perfect end. Few ideas are more startling (is a reflection of Dr. Evans) than those produced by the strange combinations in Scripture. Matters are joined there which we mostly put asunder here, speaking of them, at least, as apart. And thus we read in the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-9.htm" title="Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:">James 1:9</a>) of the <span class= "ital">kingdom and patience</span> of Jesus Christ. But all Christians are citizens of a patient kingdom; the King thereof is more patient, as He hath greater need of patience than His subjects, and He is patient, because He is strong. Impatience is a sign of weakness. God can afford to wait, for His time is eternity. And we can be strong in His strength, and wait also in patience. In so far as St. James's hearers were earthly minded, they could not learn this lesson; so often with ourselves we would have our wrong righted instantly, and to the full. Only one view of life can alter this, viz., the lifting of our gaze from earth to heaven, remembering that "the time is short" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;">1Corinthians 7:29</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The early and latter rain.</span>--It is, perhaps, just as well to recollect there were only two seasons of rainfall in the Holy Land, and, if long delayed, famine was a certain result. With the change of the Israelites from pastoral life to agricultural, the malignity of these dearths was lessened; but they were and are still severe. The Bible mentions many such--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the days of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-10.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.">Genesis 12:10</a>), Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-1.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.">Genesis 26:1</a>), Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-2.htm" title="And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die.">Genesis 42:2</a>), Ruth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a>), Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2Samuel 21:1</a>), Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-2.htm" title="And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.">1Kings 18:2</a>). The "early rain" fell during the autumn sowing--in October, November, and December; "the latter" in March and April. By many versions the word "rain" is omitted, but, of course, was always intended.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-20.</span> - CONCLUDING EXHORTATIONS <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> TO PATIENCE (vers. 7-11); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> AGAINST SWEARING (ver. 12); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> TO PRACTICAL CONDUCT IN HEALTH AND IN SICKNESS (ver. 13, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortation to patience.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be patient therefore</span>. In his concluding remarks St. James reverts to the point from which he started (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3, 4</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is here given a wider meaning than that which generally attaches to it. As was pointed out in the notes on James 1:3, it ordinarily refers to patience in respect of persons. Here, however, it certainly includes endurance in respect of things, so that the husbandman is said <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> where we should rather have expected <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the coming of the Lord</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">usque ad adventure Domiai.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;</span> been used by our Lord himself of his return to judge, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3, 27, 37, 39</a>. It is also found in St. Paul's writings, only, however (in this sense), in Thessalonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1, 8</a>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>. St. Peter uses it in his Second Epistle (2 Peter 1:16; 3:4, 12), as does St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the husbandman</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Consideration</span>, <span class="accented">exciting to patience</span>, <span class="accented">drawn from an example before the eyes of all. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Until he receive</span>; better, taking <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> as the subject of the verb, <span class="accented">until it receive. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The early and the latter rain</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> of the Received Text has the authority of A, K, L, and the Syriac Versions; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> (with which agree the Coptic and Old Latin, if), <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>.

(For "<span class="accented">the</span> early and the latter rain," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>.) "The first showers of autumn which revived the parched and thirsty soil and prepared it for the seed; and the later showers of spring which continued to refresh and forward both the ripening crops and the vernal products of the field" (Robinson, quoted in 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 2:994). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-11 Consider him that waits for a crop of corn; and will not you wait for a crown of glory? If you should be called to wait longer than the husbandman, is not there something more worth waiting for? In every sense the coming of the Lord drew nigh, and all his people's losses, hardships, and sufferings, would be repaid. Men count time long, because they measure it by their own lives; but all time is as nothing to God; it is as a moment. To short-lived creatures a few years seem an age; but Scripture, measuring all things by the existence of God, reckons thousands of years but so many days. God brought about things in Job's case, so as plainly to prove that he is very pitiful and of tender mercy. This did not appear during his troubles, but was seen in the event, and believers now will find a happy end to their trials. Let us serve our God, and bear our trials, as those who believe that the end will crown all. Our eternal happiness is safe if we trust to him: all else is mere vanity, which soon will be done with for ever.</body></html>
