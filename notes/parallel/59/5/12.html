The text, taken as it stands, would support the views of the Essenes, and many of the Paulicians, and other ancient sectaries. With equal force it might be urged by the followers of Peter Waldo, or the Unitas Fratrum (the Moravians), or the Society of Friends.<p><span class= "bld">Swear not.</span>--The words are put quite distinctly in Greek and English--<span class= "ital">neither by the heaven, nor by the earth.</span> And it sounds like special pleading, worthy of a rabbi, to hear such a divine as Huther say that "swearing by the name of God is not mentioned," nor accordingly is such an oath prohibited. "We must not imagine," he continues (and his argument had best be fairly given), "that this is included in the last member of the clause, the Apostle evidently intending by it (<span class= "ital">i.e., '</span>neither by any other oath') to point only at certain formulae, of which several are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-34.htm" title="But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:">Matthew 5:34-37</a>. Had he intended to forbid swearing by the name of God he would most certainly have mentioned it expressly; for not only is it in the Law, in contradistinction to other oaths, commanded (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you hold, and swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm" title="But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.">Psalm 63:11</a>), but in the prophets is announced as a token of the future turning of men to God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the middle of my people.">Jeremiah 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-7.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>). There were, we learn, many subtle distinctions in Jewish oaths; and the unlucky foreigner who trusted in an apparently firm one, too often found out his mistake. Certainly all such subterfuges are utterly condemned; and further, every word which breaks the letter or spirit of God's Third Commandment. As to the higher judicial forms of oaths, remembering that our Lord answered such before Caiaphas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63-64</a>), we can fearlessly conclude, with the 39th Article of Religion, that "a man may swear, when the magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the prophet's teaching--in justice, judgment, and truth."<p><span class= "bld">Let your yea be yea . . .</span>--Your word be as your bond, needing no strengthening by any invocation of God, or holy things, "lest ye fall into <span class= "ital">judgment</span>"--not "condemnation," though certainly such might follow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortation against swearing</span>, founded on our Lord's teaching in the sermon on the mount, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a> - a passage which was evidently present to St. James's thoughts. He, like his Master, "lays down rules and maxims and principles without specifying the limitations and exceptions." The sermon on the mount, as interpreted by our Lord's own actions, is a clear witness that this formed <span class="accented">Ms</span> method of teaching. If, then, his words do not touch the case of oaths solemnly tendered to men in a court of justice (and his own acceptance of an adjuration on his trial shows that they do <span class="accented">not</span>), no more do St. James's. Both our Lord and his apostle had probably in view "only those profane adjurations with which men who have no deep-seated fear of God garnish their common talk" (see Sadler's 'Commentary on St. Matthew,' p. 66). The special oaths mentioned were those in vogue among the Jews, and just the very ones which our Lord himself had specified (comp. Lightfoot's 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. 2. p. 127, edit. Gandell). On the need of such teaching as this, see Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 190: "This people are fearfully profane. Everybody curses and swears when in a passion. No people that I have ever known can compare with these Orientals for profaneness in the use of the names and attributes of God. The evil habit seems inveterate and universal. When Peter, therefore, 'began to curse and to swear' on that dismal night of temptation, we are not to suppose that it was something foreign to his former habits. He merely relapsed, under high excitement, into what, as a sailor and a fisherman, he had been accustomed to all his life. The people now use the very same sort of oaths that are mentioned and condemned by our Lord. They swear by the head, by their life, by heaven, by the temple, or what is in its place, the church. The forms of cursing and swearing, however, are almost infinite, and fall on the pained ear all day long." So, too, Aben Ezra speaks of the practice of swearing as almost universal in his day, so that he says, "men swear daily countless times, and then swear that they have not sworn!" With regard to the translation of the verse, two renderings are possible: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of the A.V. and of the R.V. (text), "Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of the R.V. margin, "Let yours be the yea, yea, and the nay, nay;" viz. those enjoined by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>), "Let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." On behalf of this latter rendering, may be pleaded <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the clearness of the reference to our Lord's teaching; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the fact that this is the interpretation given to the clause in the two leading versions of antiquity, the Syriac and the Vulgate, both of which have exactly the same words here and in St. Matthew. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sit autem sermo vester est est</span>, <span class="accented">non non. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Lest ye fall into condemnation</span>. Happily the A.V. here follows the text of the Elzevirs, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, Latt., Syriac, Coptic), and so avoids the erroneous reading of Stephens, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (K, L). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-18 The sin of swearing is condemned; but how many make light of common profane swearing! Such swearing expressly throws contempt upon God's name and authority. This sin brings neither gain, nor pleasure, nor reputation, but is showing enmity to God without occasion and without advantage It shows a man to be an enemy to God, however he pretends to call himself by his name, or sometimes joins in acts of worship. But the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. In a day of affliction nothing is more seasonable than prayer. The spirit is then most humble, and the heart is broken and tender. It is necessary to exercise faith and hope under afflictions; and prayer is the appointed means for obtaining and increasing these graces. Observe, that the saving of the sick is not ascribed to the anointing with oil, but to prayer. In a time of sickness it is not cold and formal prayer that is effectual, but the prayer of faith. The great thing we should beg of God for ourselves and others in the time of sickness is, the pardon of sin. Let nothing be done to encourage any to delay, under the mistaken fancy that a confession, a prayer, a minister's absolution and exhortation, or the sacrament, will set all right at last, where the duties of a godly life have been disregarded. To acknowledge our faults to each other, will tend greatly to peace and brotherly love. And when a righteous person, a true believer, justified in Christ, and by his grace walking before God in holy obedience, presents an effectual fervent prayer, wrought in his heart by the power of the Holy Spirit, raising holy affections and believing expectations and so leading earnestly to plead the promises of God at his mercy-seat, it avails much. The power of prayer is proved from the history of Elijah. In prayer we must not look to the merit of man, but to the grace of God. It is not enough to say a prayer, but we must pray in prayer. Thoughts must be fixed, desires must be firm and ardent, and graces exercised. This instance of the power of prayer, encourages every Christian to be earnest in prayer. God never says to any of the seed of Jacob, Seek my face in vain. Where there may not be so much of miracle in God's answering our prayers, yet there may be as much of grace.</body></html>
