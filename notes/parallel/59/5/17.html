In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>, the prophet simply and sternly tells Ahab "there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word." Further on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/18-41.htm" title="And Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.">1Kings 18:41-46</a>) "there is a sound of abundance of rain." In our Epistle we read that Elias "prayed earnestly"--literally, <span class= "ital">prayed in his prayer, </span>a Hebraistic form of emphasis (see margin). He asked for drought, and it lasted three years and a half, so that "there was a sore famine in Samaria." He prayed once more, and "the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain," and thus again "the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man." Yet Elijah was no demi-god; we even learn how he shrank from his prophet's yoke, and longed to die. No one therefore may despair in his petitions but rather let his "requests be made known unto God;" for "men ought always to pray, and not to faint" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-1.htm" title="And he spoke a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;">Luke 18:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">It rained not on the earth.</span>--This Orientalism need not be a snare to the most literal of readers. The punishment, because of Ahab and Jezebel, fell on their own kingdom, and not the whole world. In a similar hyperbole Obadiah told Elijah, concerning this very famine, "there is no nation, or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-10.htm" title="As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you not.">1Kings 18:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - Illustration of the last statement of ver. 16, from the case of Elijah, "a righteous man" under the old covenant, but one "of like passions with us," and therefore one from whose case it is lawful to argue to our own. <span class="cmt_word">Subject to like passions as we are</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>: simply "of like passions with us;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>, where it is used in just the same way.

Winer, p. 584). For the incident alluded to by St. James, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>; but note <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that we are never told that the famine was in consequence of Elijah's prayer; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> nothing is said of the duration of time (three years and a half) during which it rained not upon the earth. All we read is that "after many days the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year;" but there is no clear indication from what period this "third year" is dated. With regard to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, it may have been St. James's own inference from the narrative, or may have been due to tradition. With regard to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, the very same time is mentioned by our Lord in his allusion to the same incident (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25</a>), "<span class="accented">the</span> heaven was shut up three years and six months." And as the same period is said to be given in the Yalkut Shimeoni on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16.htm">1 Kings 16</a>, it was probably the time handed down by tradition, being taken by the Jews as a symbol of times of tribulation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-18 The sin of swearing is condemned; but how many make light of common profane swearing! Such swearing expressly throws contempt upon God's name and authority. This sin brings neither gain, nor pleasure, nor reputation, but is showing enmity to God without occasion and without advantage It shows a man to be an enemy to God, however he pretends to call himself by his name, or sometimes joins in acts of worship. But the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. In a day of affliction nothing is more seasonable than prayer. The spirit is then most humble, and the heart is broken and tender. It is necessary to exercise faith and hope under afflictions; and prayer is the appointed means for obtaining and increasing these graces. Observe, that the saving of the sick is not ascribed to the anointing with oil, but to prayer. In a time of sickness it is not cold and formal prayer that is effectual, but the prayer of faith. The great thing we should beg of God for ourselves and others in the time of sickness is, the pardon of sin. Let nothing be done to encourage any to delay, under the mistaken fancy that a confession, a prayer, a minister's absolution and exhortation, or the sacrament, will set all right at last, where the duties of a godly life have been disregarded. To acknowledge our faults to each other, will tend greatly to peace and brotherly love. And when a righteous person, a true believer, justified in Christ, and by his grace walking before God in holy obedience, presents an effectual fervent prayer, wrought in his heart by the power of the Holy Spirit, raising holy affections and believing expectations and so leading earnestly to plead the promises of God at his mercy-seat, it avails much. The power of prayer is proved from the history of Elijah. In prayer we must not look to the merit of man, but to the grace of God. It is not enough to say a prayer, but we must pray in prayer. Thoughts must be fixed, desires must be firm and ardent, and graces exercised. This instance of the power of prayer, encourages every Christian to be earnest in prayer. God never says to any of the seed of Jacob, Seek my face in vain. Where there may not be so much of miracle in God's answering our prayers, yet there may be as much of grace.</body></html>
