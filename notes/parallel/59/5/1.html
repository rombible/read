Calvin and others of his school fail to see in this passage an exhortation of the rich to penitence, but only a denunciation of woe upon them; in the sense, however, that all prophecy, whether evil or good, is conditional, there is sufficient room to believe that no irrevocable doom was pronounced by "a Christian Jeremiah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - DENUNCIATION OF THE RICH FOR <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> GRINDING DOWN THE POOR AND KEEPING BACK THEIR WAGES; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> LUXURY; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> MURDER. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The whole section resembles nothing so much as an utterance of one of the old Jewish prophets.

All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up in judgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding and oppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid us to use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinful pleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfit themselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodily appetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such suffer by oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, the Jews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them, even Jesus Christ the righteous.</body></html>
