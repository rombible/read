"We have," observes Alford, "<span class= "ital">a general injunction</span> arising out of a circumstance necessarily to be inferred in the preceding example (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-14.htm" title="Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:">James 5:14-15</a>). There, the sin would of necessity have been confessed to the elders, before the prayer of faith could deal with it. And seeing the blessed consequences in that case 'generally,' says the Apostle, in all similar cases, and 'one to another universally, pursue the same salutary practice of confessing your sins . . .' <span class= "ital">Confess therefore one to another</span>--not only to the elders (<span class= "ital">presbyters</span>) in the case supposed, but to one another generally--<span class= "ital">your transgressions, and pray for one another that ye may be healed, </span>in case of sickness, as above. The context here forbids any wider meaning . . . and it might appear astonishing, were it not notorious, that on this passage, among others, is built the Romish doctrine of the necessity of confessing sins to a priest."<p>Not that all Roman Catholic divines, indeed, have thus read the injunction. Some of the ablest and greatest have admitted "that we cannot certainly affirm sacramental confession to have been meant or spoken of in this place" (Hooker). How then did the gradual perversion take hold of men's minds? The most laborious investigation of history and theology will alone answer the question properly; and here only a brief <span class= "ital">resume</span> is possible. There can be little doubt that, strictly consonant with the apostolic charge, open confession was the custom of old. Offenders hastened to some minister of God, and in words, by which all present in the congregation might take notice of the fault, declared their guilt; convenient remedies were as publicly prescribed, and then all present joined in prayer to God. But after awhile, for many patent reasons, this plain talk about sins was rightly judged to be a cause of mischief to the young and innocent; and such confessions were relegated to a private hearing. The change was in most ways beneficial, and hardly suspected of being a step in a completely new doctrine. It needed years--centuries, in fact--to develop into the hard system of compulsory individual bondage which cost Europe untold blood and treasure to break asunder. A salutary practice in the case of some unhappy creatures, weakened by their vices into a habit of continual sin, was scarcely to be conceived as a rule thrust upon all the Christian world. Yet such it was, and "at length auricular confession, followed by absolution and satisfaction, was elevated to the full dignity of a necessary sacrament. The Council of Trent anathematises all who deny it to be truly and properly a sacrament instituted by Christ Himself, and necessary to salvation (<span class= "ital">jure divino</span>); or who say that the method of confessing secretly to the priest alone . . . is alien to Christ's institution, and of human invention" (Harold Browne). Marvellous perversity of acute brains and worthy sentiment, showing only how steep is the way of error; and how for Christian as for Jew the danger of tradition is perilous indeed. "To conclude," in the words of Hooker, "we everywhere find the use of confession, especially public, allowed of, and commended by the fathers; but that extreme and rigorous necessity of auricular and private confession, which is at this day so mightily upheld by the Church of Rome, we find not. It was not then the faith and doctrine of God's Church, as of the Papacy at this present--(1) that the only remedy for sin after baptism is sacramental penitency; (2) that confession in secret is an essential part thereof; (3) that God Himself cannot now forgive sins without the priest; (4) that because forgiveness at the hands of the priests must arise from confession in the offender, therefore to confess unto him is a matter of such necessity as, being not either in deed, or, at the least, in desire, performed, excludeth utterly from all pardon, and must consequently in Scripture be commanded wheresoever any promise of forgiveness is made. No, no; these opinions have youth in their countenance. Antiquity knew them not; it never thought nor dreamed of them" (<span class= "ital">E. P</span>., vi. iv. 14).<p>"As for private confession," says Jewel in his <span class= "ital">Apology, "</span>abuses and errors set apart, we condemn it not, but leave it at liberty." Such must be the teaching of any Church which, in the epigram of Bishop Ken, "stands distinguished from all papal and puritan innovations," resting upon God's Word, and the earliest, holiest, simplest, best traditions of the Apostles of His dear Son. And if an ancient custom has become a universal practice in the Latin communion, presumed to be of sacramental virtue, scholars will tell us that the notion has never been absent altogether from any branch of the Catholic Church; and that in some shape or form, it lives in most of those societies which sprang into existence at the Reformation largely from abhorrence of the tyranny and misuse of confession.<p><span class= "bld">The effectual fervent prayer . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">The prayer of a righteous man availeth much in its working.</span> It moves the hand of Him Who moves the world.<p>"What are men better than sheep, or goats,<p>That nourish a blind life within the brain,<p>If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer--<p>Both for themselves, and those who call them friend?<p>For so the whole round earth is, every way,<p>Bound by gold chains about the feet of God."<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-2.htm" title="And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Matthew 14:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm" title="And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Mark 6:14</a>, we read of John the Baptist, that "mighty works do <span class= "ital">show forth</span> themselves in him." A nearer approach to the sense would be "they work"--<span class= "ital">energise, </span>if we might coin a word; and such is also the meaning of the present passage--the prayer of the just, pleading, striving fervently, hath power with God, even like Israel of old, and shall prevail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm" title="And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.">Genesis 32:28</a>). Some divines trace a literal force in the passage, finding in it an allusion to the Energumens of the first century (the "mediums" of that age), who were possessed by demons; that, just as these unhappy beings strove in their bondage, so equally--nay, infinitely more--should Christians "wrestle with the Lord."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Confess therefore your sins, etc. The authority for the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> (omitted in the Received Text) is overwhelming (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, K, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic), as is also that for the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, which includes the three oldest manuscripts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, the two latter of which also read <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>. It is difficult to know exactly what to make of this injunction to confess "one to another," which is stated in the form of an inference from the preceding. The form of the expression, "one to another," and the perfectly general term, "a righteous man," forbid us to see in it a direct injunction to confess to the clergy, and to the clergy only. But on the other hand, it is unfair to lose sight of the fact that it is directly connected with the charge to send for the elders of the Church. Marshall, in his' Penitential Discipline,' is perfectly justified in saying that St. James "hath plainly supposed the presence of the elders of the Church, and their intercession to God for the sick penitent, and then recommended the confession of his faults in that presence, where two or three assembled together in the Name of Christ might constitute a Church for that purpose" ('Penit. Discipline,' p. 80). We may, perhaps, be content with saying, with Bishop Jeremy Taylor, "When St. James exhorts all Christians to confess their sins one to another, certainly it is more agreeable to all spiritual ends that this be done rather to the curate of souls than to the ordinary brethren" ('Dissuasive from Popery,' II. 1:11; cf. Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 6. 4:5, 7). <span class="cmt_word">The effectual fervent prayer</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">the petition of a righteous man availeth much in its working.</span> On the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> the narrower, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> the wider word, see Trench on ' Synonyms,' p. 179. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-18 The sin of swearing is condemned; but how many make light of common profane swearing! Such swearing expressly throws contempt upon God's name and authority. This sin brings neither gain, nor pleasure, nor reputation, but is showing enmity to God without occasion and without advantage It shows a man to be an enemy to God, however he pretends to call himself by his name, or sometimes joins in acts of worship. But the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. In a day of affliction nothing is more seasonable than prayer. The spirit is then most humble, and the heart is broken and tender. It is necessary to exercise faith and hope under afflictions; and prayer is the appointed means for obtaining and increasing these graces. Observe, that the saving of the sick is not ascribed to the anointing with oil, but to prayer. In a time of sickness it is not cold and formal prayer that is effectual, but the prayer of faith. The great thing we should beg of God for ourselves and others in the time of sickness is, the pardon of sin. Let nothing be done to encourage any to delay, under the mistaken fancy that a confession, a prayer, a minister's absolution and exhortation, or the sacrament, will set all right at last, where the duties of a godly life have been disregarded. To acknowledge our faults to each other, will tend greatly to peace and brotherly love. And when a righteous person, a true believer, justified in Christ, and by his grace walking before God in holy obedience, presents an effectual fervent prayer, wrought in his heart by the power of the Holy Spirit, raising holy affections and believing expectations and so leading earnestly to plead the promises of God at his mercy-seat, it avails much. The power of prayer is proved from the history of Elijah. In prayer we must not look to the merit of man, but to the grace of God. It is not enough to say a prayer, but we must pray in prayer. Thoughts must be fixed, desires must be firm and ardent, and graces exercised. This instance of the power of prayer, encourages every Christian to be earnest in prayer. God never says to any of the seed of Jacob, Seek my face in vain. Where there may not be so much of miracle in God's answering our prayers, yet there may be as much of grace.</body></html>
