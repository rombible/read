The heathen philosopher Solon called no one "happy" upon earth; but, with the mystery of pain around him, cried sadly, "Look to the end." And the sated and weary soul of Solomon had no better thought than to praise "the dead which are already dead, more than the living" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm" title="Why I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>). How different the teaching of St. James, himself taught by the example of the suffering Christ: verily, "he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than" the greatest and the wisest who know not of its light and peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-11.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.">Matthew 11:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The patience of</span> <span class= "bld">Job.</span>--The earliest notions current in the world were, doubtless, that on the whole prosperity came to those who lived morally and physically well, while adversity in body or mind followed closely on the wicked and improvident. It is easy to see how these opinions, even among the happier races who had not wandered far from God, gradually hardened into stern rules of judgment, by which each man saw in the chances and calamities of life an immediate effort of an avenging Deity. This was ages before a pious Asaph (Psalms 73) could reflect on the contradiction of experience in this matter, and be troubled at the "prosperity" of the wicked; or before the wise king could notice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm" title="All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm" title="There is a vanity which is done on the earth; that there be just men, to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>) the just man perishing "in his righteousness," and the unjust prolonging "his days in wickedness"; "the fishes taken in an evil net," and "the birds caught in the snare" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm" title="For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>). It was ages earlier still than the presence of that Wiser than Solomon, who spoke of the hapless "eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell"--"Think ye that they were sinners above all?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/13-4.htm" title="Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?">Luke 13:4-5</a>). Job's friends were so certain of his misdeeds, that they would not hear his self-defence; if God tried his endurance, man surely afflicted his patience. We can hear the three in council against him, becoming more zealous as they believe themselves the defenders of God's justice. (See Job 4-22) They are shocked at Job's obstinacy, and annoyed into vehement accusation against him, because he will "hold fast" to his "integrity." It is a damning proof to them of his guilt. Not only had he been wicked, but now actually he is impious and rebellious; such conduct is not to be borne. "Is not thy wickedness great?" says Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm" title="Is not your wickedness great? and your iniquities infinite?">Job 22:5</a>). Thou must have--nay, "thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing;" thou couldst not--nay, "thou hast not given water to the weary, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry:" truly thine iniquities are infinite." Now, we know Job was innocent; God Himself bears witness to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil?">Job 1:8</a>). And finally the suffering, patient, righteous man was declared to have spoken wisely: as Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar the contrary. They--types of a censorious piety--had conceived of God by their own faulty notions of religion, and fondly deemed they could enter into the motives of the Most High. Job for awhile had seemed to cloud his own belief with baser attributes, as (Job 16 <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) to a God who causelessly dealt in cruelty and pain; but through such fleeting mistakes he rose at last to the full conviction of His perfect truth and justice. It might be that He gave happiness to those who sought Him; it might be He allowed them misery--as the world would call it; but this nor that had part in the matter at issue. Earthly blessings "He gives to whom He wills, or leaves to the powers of nature to distribute among those who fulfil the laws" thereof; but "to serve him and love Him is higher and better than any mundane welfare, though it be with wounded feet and bleeding forehead, or an ash-heap and filthy sores" (Froude). This was the faith to which Job attained: higher, "clearer, purer, there is not possible to man." In such like "patience" it were well for us that we should "possess our souls" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And have seen</span> <span class= "bld">the end of the Lord.</span>--Better thus, <span class= "ital">Ye have heard</span> . . . <span class= "ital">see also the end of the Lord.</span> The reference is at once past and future: consider, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>what God wrought in the end of trial, on the faithful of old time, like Job; learn from it how great a deliverance He will also work for you. But "if ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-9.htm" title="And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.">Isaiah 7:9</a>). It is a mistake to understand here any allusion to the death of Christ, as if the Apostle spoke to those who witnessed it.<p><span class= "bld">That the Lord is very pitiful.</span>--St. James, in the fulness of his gratitude, seems to have coined a word for this single place. "Great-hearted" would be close to its meaning; but originally the <span class= "ital">bowels</span> were thought to be the seat of the affections, and hence such terms of expression: as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-30.htm" title="And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn on his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.">Genesis 43:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-26.htm" title="Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king, for her bowels yearned on her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither my nor yours, but divide it.">1Kings 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm" title="Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where is your zeal and your strength, the sounding of your bowels and of your mercies toward me? are they restrained?">Isaiah 63:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-20.htm" title="Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.">Lamentations 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1John 3:17</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span><p>"The Lord" here is Jehovah: under which name the Lord spake and wrought before He was made man.

The "end of the Lord (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)" cannot possibly be interpreted of the death and resurrection of our Savior. The whole context is against this, and <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> would certainly require the article. The Syriac Version rightly interprets the clause, "the end which the Lord wrought for him." It dearly refers to the end which God brought about in the case of Job, whose "latter end the Lord blessed more than his beginning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>; cf. Winer, 'Grammar of New Testament Greek,' p. 309). <span class="cmt_word">That the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy,</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: here only; never in the LXX, but equivalent to Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>.

If you should be called to wait longer than the husbandman, is not there something more worth waiting for? In every sense the coming of the Lord drew nigh, and all his people's losses, hardships, and sufferings, would be repaid. Men count time long, because they measure it by their own lives; but all time is as nothing to God; it is as a moment. To short-lived creatures a few years seem an age; but Scripture, measuring all things by the existence of God, reckons thousands of years but so many days. God brought about things in Job's case, so as plainly to prove that he is very pitiful and of tender mercy. This did not appear during his troubles, but was seen in the event, and believers now will find a happy end to their trials. Let us serve our God, and bear our trials, as those who believe that the end will crown all. Our eternal happiness is safe if we trust to him: all else is mere vanity, which soon will be done with for ever.</body></html>
