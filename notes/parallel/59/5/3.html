But there was no mistake on the part of the inspired. writers; freedom from error in their Sacred office must be vindicated, or who shall sever the false gospel from the true? The simple explanation is an old one--the <span class= "ital">potential</span> nearness of Christ, as it is called. In many ways He has been ever near each individual, as by affliction, or death, or judgment; but His actual return was probably nearer in the first ages of faith than in the brutality of the tenth century, or the splendid atheism of the fifteenth, or the intellectual pride of the nineteenth. His advent is helped or hindered by the state of Christendom itself: "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a>), there is: neither past nor future in His sight; only the presence of His own determination: and nought retards Christ's Second Coming so much as the false and feeble Christianity which prays "Thy kingdom come" in frequent words, but waits not as the handmaid of her Lord, with "loins girded about and lights burning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35</a>), "until the day dawn, and the day star arise" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - With this and the preceding verse contrast our Lord's words of treasure laid up in heaven, "where moth and rust do not corrupt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Cankered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); better, <span class="accented">rusted.</span> Only here in the New Testament; never in the LXX. except Ecclus. 12:11. <span class="cmt_word">The rust of them.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: used here for "rust" as in the LXX. in Ezekiel's parable of the boiling pot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-6.htm">Ezekiel 24:6</a>, etc.) - a passage which (according to one interpretation) may have suggested the following clause, "and shall eat your flesh," etc. (see vers. 9-12). <span class="cmt_word">Shall he a witness against you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). The rendering of the A.V. is quite defensible (see Winer, p. 265), but it is equally possible to take the words as the R.V. margin," for a testimony <span class="accented">unto</span> you." "The rust of them," says Alford, "is a token of what shall happen to yourselves; in the consuming of your wealth you see depicted your own." Two interpretations of the latter part of the verse are possible, depending on the punctuation adopted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As the A.V. and R.V., putting the stop after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>: "Their rust... shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days." The "fire," if this rendering be adopted, may be explained from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-9.htm">Ezekiel 24:9</a>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Putting the stop after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and before <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>: "Their rust... shall eat your flesh. Ye have heaped up as it were fire in the last days." This has the support of the Syriac ("Ye have gathered fire for you for the last days"), and is adopted by Drs. Westcott and Herr. The "fire" will, of course, be the fire of judgment; and the expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may easily have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>. The whole form of expression also reminds us of St. Paul's "treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>), to which it is exactly parallel, the "wrath in the day of wrath" there answering to the "fire in the last days" here. (The rendering of the Vulgate is evidently influenced by this parallel, as it has <span class="accented">thesaurizastis tram.</span>) For the last days; rather, <span class="accented">in the last days</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>. If the words are connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> as suggested above, there is no difficulty in them. If the punctuation of the A.V. be retained, we must suppose that the writer is speaking from the point of view of the last day of all. "When the end came it found them heaping up treasures which they could never use" (Dean Scott). But the other view, though not so generally adopted, seems fat' preferable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Public troubles are most grievous to those who live in pleasure, and are secure and sensual, though all ranks suffer deeply at such times. All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up in judgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding and oppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid us to use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinful pleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfit themselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodily appetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such suffer by oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, the Jews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them, even Jesus Christ the righteous.</body></html>
