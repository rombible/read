In the one Christ lingers mercifully outside the door that "loves its hinge"; fain would He enter and abide. In the other He sounds a note of alarm; men are "waked in the night, not girding their loins for a journey, but in vague wonder at uncertain noise, who may turn again to their slumber," or in wistful listening wait in vain for the voice of mercy which shall plead with them no more for ever (Ruskin).<p>One of the mocking questions put to St. James by his enemies, as they hurried him to death, was, "Which is the <span class= "ital">door</span> of Jesus?" And failing to receive an answer to their mind, they said, "Let us stone this James the Just!" which they did, after they had cast him over the Temple wall.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grudge not, brethren</span>; better, with R.V., <span class="accented">murmur not -</span> a meaning which "grudge" had in the seventeenth century; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a> (Prayer-book version), "They will run here and there for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied." What is the connection of this verse with the preceding? "Murmuring" implies sitting in judgment upon others, which has been expressly forbidden by the Lord himself. It is also the opposite to that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to which St. James has been exhorting his readers. <span class="cmt_word">Lest ye be condemned</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that ye be not judged. </span> <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1</a>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> of the Received Text has absolutely no authority, nor has the omission of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> in the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Judge</span>, etc. The nearness of the judgment is expressed by saying that the Judge is actually standing "before the doors (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." So also our Lord, in his great discourse on the judgment, says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-33.htm">Matthew 24:33</a>), "When ye see all these things, know that he is nigh, <span class="accented">even at the doors</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>);" and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where he <span class="accented">says</span>, "Behold, I stand at the door (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), and knock." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-11 Consider him that waits for a crop of corn; and will not you wait for a crown of glory? If you should be called to wait longer than the husbandman, is not there something more worth waiting for? In every sense the coming of the Lord drew nigh, and all his people's losses, hardships, and sufferings, would be repaid. Men count time long, because they measure it by their own lives; but all time is as nothing to God; it is as a moment. To short-lived creatures a few years seem an age; but Scripture, measuring all things by the existence of God, reckons thousands of years but so many days. God brought about things in Job's case, so as plainly to prove that he is very pitiful and of tender mercy. This did not appear during his troubles, but was seen in the event, and believers now will find a happy end to their trials. Let us serve our God, and bear our trials, as those who believe that the end will crown all. Our eternal happiness is safe if we trust to him: all else is mere vanity, which soon will be done with for ever.</body></html>
