Prayer is to be the refuge of one, praise the safeguard of another; the whole life is to revolve, as it were, around the throne of God, whether in the night of grief or day of joy.<p><span class= "bld">Let him pray.</span>--No worthier comment can be found than Montgomery's hymn--<p>"Prayer is the burden of a sigh,<p>The falling of a tear,<p>The upward glancing of an eye,<p>When none but God is near."<p>Long petitions, or many, cannot be always made; mind and body may be too weak and ill; but ejaculations--"Arrows of the Lord's deliverance," as Augustine called them, "shot out with a sudden quickness"--these are ever in the power of the beleaguered Christian. And--<p>"More things are wrought by prayer<p>Than this world dreams of."<p><span class= "bld">Let him sing</span>.--The word originally applied to instrumental music, the Eastern accompaniment of "psalms." Praise, like prayer, ought to be individual as well as congregational. Hymns might be used by all in their devotions, and could not fail to be a blessing; while for those who have God's great gift of music, it were surely better to sing--as the Apostle urges--than to say. There is a sadness latent in the most jubilant of earthly tunes, but not so with the heavenly; and quiring angels do not scorn to catch our humblest notes, and weave them in their endless song, if they be raised in thankfulness to Him Whom they and all creation praise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-20.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortations with respect to practical conduct in health and sickness.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Is any among you suffering? let him pray. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Is any cheerful? let him sing praise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Prayer in the narrower sense of <span class="accented">petition</span> is rather for sufferers, who need to have their wants supplied and their sorrows removed. Praise, the highest form of prayer, is to spring up from the grateful heart of the cheerful. <span class="greek">&#x3a8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-18 The sin of swearing is condemned; but how many make light of common profane swearing! Such swearing expressly throws contempt upon God's name and authority. This sin brings neither gain, nor pleasure, nor reputation, but is showing enmity to God without occasion and without advantage It shows a man to be an enemy to God, however he pretends to call himself by his name, or sometimes joins in acts of worship. But the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. In a day of affliction nothing is more seasonable than prayer. The spirit is then most humble, and the heart is broken and tender. It is necessary to exercise faith and hope under afflictions; and prayer is the appointed means for obtaining and increasing these graces. Observe, that the saving of the sick is not ascribed to the anointing with oil, but to prayer. In a time of sickness it is not cold and formal prayer that is effectual, but the prayer of faith. The great thing we should beg of God for ourselves and others in the time of sickness is, the pardon of sin. Let nothing be done to encourage any to delay, under the mistaken fancy that a confession, a prayer, a minister's absolution and exhortation, or the sacrament, will set all right at last, where the duties of a godly life have been disregarded. To acknowledge our faults to each other, will tend greatly to peace and brotherly love. And when a righteous person, a true believer, justified in Christ, and by his grace walking before God in holy obedience, presents an effectual fervent prayer, wrought in his heart by the power of the Holy Spirit, raising holy affections and believing expectations and so leading earnestly to plead the promises of God at his mercy-seat, it avails much. The power of prayer is proved from the history of Elijah. In prayer we must not look to the merit of man, but to the grace of God. It is not enough to say a prayer, but we must pray in prayer. Thoughts must be fixed, desires must be firm and ardent, and graces exercised. This instance of the power of prayer, encourages every Christian to be earnest in prayer. God never says to any of the seed of Jacob, Seek my face in vain. Where there may not be so much of miracle in God's answering our prayers, yet there may be as much of grace.</body></html>
