Such a reference, however, has been disallowed by some commentators, as conveying too harsh an accusation against the whole Jewish people<span class= "ital">;</span> and besides, it being unfair to forget that St. James was writing to Christian Jews, as well as to the anti-Christian. But, in a manner, all wrong and oppression tend towards the murder of the Just One, as every falsehood (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-13.htm" title="Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.">James 3:13</a>) is an attack on the Truth. And far beyond this, in the present case our Lord is rightly to be considered the victim of the Jews. His blood is on them and on their children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-25.htm" title="Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.">Matthew 27:25</a>); they filled up "the measure of their fathers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-32.htm" title="Fill you up then the measure of your fathers.">Matthew 23:32</a>), that "the blood of all the righteous" might come upon them, from Abel to Zacharias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>): the one crowning sin made them guilty of all. And not only is this backward participation true, but there is a forward one as well. Christ Himself was persecuted by Saul in the afflictions of His servants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4-5</a>), and so onward ever till the martyr-roll be full.<p>It is of strange significance that in this verse--<span class= "ital">ye condemned, ye slew the just</span>--James the Just prophetically described his own murderers. The last words, moreover, of the Scripture, simply record the behaviour of himself, as of every real witness for Christ: <span class= "ital">He doth not resist. </span>No: "the servant of the Lord must not strive" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-24.htm" title="And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,">2Timothy 2:24</a>) even in death; and by such meekness and resignation is best seen the likeness to the divine Master, Who "was brought as a lamb to the slaughter" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-10.htm" title="Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.">Wisdom Of Solomon 2:10-20</a> for a striking parallel, on the oppression of the righteous, which would not inaptly describe <span class= "ital">the </span>"just man," <span class= "ital">the </span>"Son of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The <span class="accented">climax of their sin. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous one.</span> Does this allude to the death of our Lord? At first sight it may well seem so. Compare St. Peter's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>, "Ye denied the Holy One and the Just (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>);" St. Stephen's in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>, "the coming of the Just One (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>);" and St. Paul's in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>, "to see the Just One (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)." But this view is dispelled when we remember how throughout this whole passage the ideas and expressions are borrowed from the Old Testament, and when we find that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a> (LXX.) the wicked are represented as saying, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> passage which lies at the root of the remarkable section in Wisd. 2, "Let us oppress the poor righteous man .... Let us condemn him with a shameful death." It is probable, then, that passages such as these were in St. James's mind, and suggested the words, and thus that there is no direct allusion to the Crucifixion (which, indeed, could scarcely be laid to the charge of his readers), but that the singular <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used to denote the class collectively (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>). It is a remarkable coincidence, pointed out by most commentators, that he who wrote these verses, himself styled <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> by the Jews, suffered death at their hands a very few years afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">He doth not resist you.</span> According to the view commonly adopted, St. James simply means to say that the righteous man suffered this evil at their hands without resistance. Another interpretation seems more possible, taking the clause as interrogative, "Does he not resist you?" the subject, implied but not expressed, being God; as if he would say, "Is not God against you? " - that God of whom it has already been said that he <span class="accented">resists</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the proud (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-6.htm">Hosea 1:6</a>, "I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, but I will utterly take them away (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>)") <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Public troubles are most grievous to those who live in pleasure, and are secure and sensual, though all ranks suffer deeply at such times. All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up in judgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding and oppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid us to use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinful pleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfit themselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodily appetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such suffer by oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, the Jews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them, even Jesus Christ the righteous.</body></html>
