The day being the Preparation, the Jews were anxious to satisfy the letter of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>), and that, more especially, because the coming sabbath was a "high day." So they had gone early to Pilate to obtain permission to accelerate the deaths of the sufferers by the terrible additional punishment called <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This violence was not inflicted upon our Lord, because he was already dead; and so another Scripture was fulfilled, "A bone of him shall not be broken." But it was necessary that Pilate should be assured of the fact that death had taken place before he gave up the body; and thus, in the providence of God, another evidence was given of the reality of Christ's death. Joseph asked for the body (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). Then Pilate asked the centurion "whether he had been any while dead." The verb here is in the aorist, and the adverb means "formerly" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">if he died some time ago.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:42-47 We are here attending the burial of our Lord Jesus. Oh that we may by grace be planted in the likeness of it! Joseph of Arimathea was one who waited for the kingdom of God. Those who hope for a share in its privileges, must own Christ's cause, when it seems to be crushed. This man God raised up for his service. There was a special providence, that Pilate should be so strict in his inquiry, that there might be no pretence to say Jesus was alive. Pilate gave Joseph leave to take down the body, and do what he pleased with it. Some of the women beheld where Jesus was laid, that they might come after the sabbath to anoint the dead body, because they had not time to do it before. Special notice was taken of Christ's sepulchre, because he was to rise again. And he will not forsake those who trust in him, and call upon him. Death, deprived of its sting, will soon end the believer's sorrows, as it ended those of the Saviour.</body></html>
