It appears from these words that Joseph himself, assisted probably by Nicodemus and others, actually took the body of our Lord down from the cross. wrapped the <span class="accented">sindon</span> round him, and laid him in his own new tomb, which had been hewn out of the rock. The word rendered "tomb" is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as being intended to be a memorial of the departed. <span class="cmt_word">And he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span> The door here means "the opening," or "entrance." Thus, while our Lord died with the wicked, he was with the rich in his death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:42-47 We are here attending the burial of our Lord Jesus. Oh that we may by grace be planted in the likeness of it! Joseph of Arimathea was one who waited for the kingdom of God. Those who hope for a share in its privileges, must own Christ's cause, when it seems to be crushed. This man God raised up for his service. There was a special providence, that Pilate should be so strict in his inquiry, that there might be no pretence to say Jesus was alive. Pilate gave Joseph leave to take down the body, and do what he pleased with it. Some of the women beheld where Jesus was laid, that they might come after the sabbath to anoint the dead body, because they had not time to do it before. Special notice was taken of Christ's sepulchre, because he was to rise again. And he will not forsake those who trust in him, and call upon him. Death, deprived of its sting, will soon end the believer's sorrows, as it ended those of the Saviour.</body></html>
