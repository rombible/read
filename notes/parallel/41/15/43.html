St. Jerome says that this city was called Ramathaim-Zophim (the lofty place), where dwelt Elkanah and Hannah of old, and where Samuel was born. Joseph was most probably a native of Arimathaea; but he was now a citizen and counsellor of Jerusalem. He was an honorable counsellor (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented">a councillor of honorable estate</span> (Revised Version). St. Matthew says he was a rich man. It is evident that he regarded himself as a settled inhabitant of Jerusalem, since he had thus provided himself with a place of sepulture. <span class="cmt_word">He was waiting for</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> literally, <span class="accented">looking for - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the kingdom of God</span>. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a>) says that he was a disciple of Jesus. These circumstances explain his desire to bury our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">He boldly went in</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">he took courage and went in - <span class="cmt_word"></span>unto</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Pilate,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> A poor man would not have dared to approach Pilate for such a purpose as this. St. Chrysostom says, "The courage of Joseph is greatly to be admired, in that, for the love of Christ, he exposed himself to the danger of death." The fact that he was "looking for the kingdom of God" explains his conduct. It shows that he believed in Christ, and through his grace hoped for everlasting salvation; and in this hope he thought little of shelving his reverence for Christ, and so" boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:42-47 We are here attending the burial of our Lord Jesus. Oh that we may by grace be planted in the likeness of it! Joseph of Arimathea was one who waited for the kingdom of God. Those who hope for a share in its privileges, must own Christ's cause, when it seems to be crushed. This man God raised up for his service. There was a special providence, that Pilate should be so strict in his inquiry, that there might be no pretence to say Jesus was alive. Pilate gave Joseph leave to take down the body, and do what he pleased with it. Some of the women beheld where Jesus was laid, that they might come after the sabbath to anoint the dead body, because they had not time to do it before. Special notice was taken of Christ's sepulchre, because he was to rise again. And he will not forsake those who trust in him, and call upon him. Death, deprived of its sting, will soon end the believer's sorrows, as it ended those of the Saviour.</body></html>
