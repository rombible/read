So also says St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>). St. Matthew says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-28.htm">Matthew 27:28</a>), "They put on him a scarlet robe (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>)." Purple and scarlet are not such very dissimilar colors. Purple is a royal color; and the <span class="accented">chlamys</span> of St. Matthew was a short military cloak of scarlet, intended to be a kind of royal livery. St. Cyril says that the purple cloak symbolized the kingdom of the whole world, which Christ was about to receive, and which he was to obtain by the shedding of his most precious blood. It was designed in mockery of his claim to be a King, and it probably bad a reference to his supposed insurrection against Caesar. All this was permitted by Pilate, in order that he might the more easily, after this ignominious treatment, deliver Christ from the extreme sentence. <span class="accented">And plaiting a crown of thorns</span>, <span class="accented">they put it on him.</span> The crown of thorns was in all probability woven from the <span class="accented">Zizyphus spina Christi</span> (the <span class="accented">nabk</span> of the Arabs), which grows abundantly in Palestine, fringing the banks of the Jordan. This plant would be very suitable for the purpose, having flexible branches, with leaves very much resembling the ivy leaf in their color, and with many sharp thorns. The pain arising from the pressure of these sharp thorns upon the head must have been excruciating. <span class="accented">And they began to salute him</span>, <span class="accented">Hail</span>, <span class="accented">King of the Jews!</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). This word, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>, was an ancient form of salutation; here used by the soldiers in bitter mockery of his claim to be a king. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:15-21 Christ met death in its greatest terror. It was the death of the vilest malefactors. Thus the cross and the shame are put together. God having been dishonoured by the sin of man, Christ made satisfaction by submitting to the greatest disgrace human nature could be loaded with. It was a cursed death; thus it was branded by the Jewish law, De 21:23. The Roman soldiers mocked our Lord Jesus as a King; thus in the high priest's hall the servants had mocked him as a Prophet and Saviour. Shall a purple or scarlet robe be matter of pride to a Christian, which was matter of reproach and shame to Christ? He wore the crown of thorns which we deserved, that we might wear the crown of glory which he merited. We were by sin liable to everlasting shame and contempt; to deliver us, our Lord Jesus submitted to shame and contempt. He was led forth with the workers of iniquity, though he did no sin. The sufferings of the meek and holy Redeemer, are ever a source of instruction to the believer, of which, in his best hours, he cannot be weary. Did Jesus thus suffer, and shall I, a vile sinner, fret or repine? Shall I indulge anger, or utter reproaches and threats because of troubles and injuries?</body></html>
