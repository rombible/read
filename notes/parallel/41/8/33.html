Then he singles out Peter, and addresses to him, in their presence, the severe rebuke, <span class="cmt_word">Get thee behind me, Satan:</span> <span class="cmt_word">for thou savourest not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">thou mindest not</span> -<span class="cmt_word">the things of God, but the</span> <span class="cmt_word">things of men</span>. The form of words is the same as that used by our Lord to Satan himself, when he was tempted by him in the wilderness. It reminded him of that great conflict. The visions of worldly glory again floated before him. The crown without the cross was again held out to him. This explains his language. Peter was indeed rebuked; but the rebuke was aimed through him at the arch adversary who was addressing him through Peter. Here is the striking significance of his "turning about." Peter was for the moment doing the tempter's work, and in "turning about" our Lord was again putting Satan behind him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:27-33 These things are written, that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. These miracles of our Lord assure us that he was not conquered, but a Conqueror. Now the disciples are convinced that Jesus is the Christ; they may bear to hear of his sufferings, of which Christ here begins to give them notice. He sees that amiss in what we say and do, of which we ourselves are not aware, and knows what manner of spirit we are of, when we ourselves do not. The wisdom of man is folly, when it pretends to limit the Divine counsels. Peter did not rightly understand the nature of Christ's kingdom.</body></html>
