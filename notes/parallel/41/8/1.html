The word here rendered "very great" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, a word not to be found anywhere else in the New Testament. But according to the best authorities, the true reading is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; so that the words would run, <span class="accented">when there was again a great multitude.</span> It has been supposed with some reason that, as an old ecclesiastical Lection began with this chapter, this may have led to the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, in order to make the Lection more complete in itself, avoiding this reference to the context. In the original Greek construction the word <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in the singular, is disintegrated in the next clause by a passage into the plural (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). This is properly marked in the Revised Version by the words, <span class="cmt_word">a great multitude,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and they had nothing to eat.</span> Our Lord has compassion on them. He desires not only to heal the sick, but to feed the hungry. We may here notice the burning zeal of the multitude. They were so intent upon hearing Christ, that they forgot to provide themselves with the necessaries of life. They continued with him for three days and had nothing to eat. Whatever small supplies they might have Brought with them at first were now exhausted; and still they remained, "esteeming his words to be more than their necessary food." Our Lord on his part was so. full of zeal for their good, that during all that time, with little interval, he had been preaching to them, denying himself rest, refreshment, and sleep. So true were those words of his, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-10 Our Lord Jesus encouraged the meanest to come to him for life and grace. Christ knows and considers our frames. The bounty of Christ is always ready; to show that, he repeated this miracle. His favours are renewed, as our wants and necessities are. And those need not fear want, who have Christ to live upon by faith, and do so with thanksgiving.</body></html>
