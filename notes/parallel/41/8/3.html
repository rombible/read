But the correct rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, is not "came," but have come, or rather, are come and instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> at the beginning of the clause, the more correct reading is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span>. This change makes the clause almost of necessity to be a part of our Lord's own words going before. It was not until the third day that our Lord interposed with a miracle, when the people were absolutely without food, and would therefore feel more sensibly the blessing as well as the greatness of the miracle. Their extremity was his opportunity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-10 Our Lord Jesus encouraged the meanest to come to him for life and grace.

And those need not fear want, who have Christ to live upon by faith, and do so with thanksgiving.</body></html>
