The points peculiar to St. Mark are, (1) that our Lord "spake that saying openly"--the absence of any reticence in this announcement of apparent failure was what startled the disciples; and (2) the graphic touch that as He rebuked Peter, He turned and looked, not on that Apostle only, but on the whole company of the disciples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things,</span> etc. In St. Matthew's narrative he says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>), "From that time began Jesus to show unto his disciples," etc. - from the time, that is, of this great confession; from the time when he had openly acknowledged to his disciples the truth of his essential Divinity; from that time he began to instruct them as to his passion and his death. There are two great principles of faith, namely, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Divinity and the humanity of Christ, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his cross and passion, whereby he has redeemed the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And it was necessary that the disciples should be thus instructed in his amazing dignity as the Son of God, lest, when they saw him put to death, they might doubt as to his Godhead. And after three days rise again. St. Matthew and St. Luke say, "on the third day" - the day of his death counting for one, and the day of his resurrection for another, with one clear day intervening. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:27-33 These things are written, that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. These miracles of our Lord assure us that he was not conquered, but a Conqueror. Now the disciples are convinced that Jesus is the Christ; they may bear to hear of his sufferings, of which Christ here begins to give them notice. He sees that amiss in what we say and do, of which we ourselves are not aware, and knows what manner of spirit we are of, when we ourselves do not. The wisdom of man is folly, when it pretends to limit the Divine counsels. Peter did not rightly understand the nature of Christ's kingdom.</body></html>
