It is obvious that general as the words are, they had a special bearing on those who, like Peter, and probably the other disciples, had shown that they were "ashamed" of the words which had just been spoken.<p><span class= "bld">This adulterous and sinful generation.</span>--The words are not found in St. Luke's report, but they agree with language which our Lord had used before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm" title="A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.">Matthew 16:4</a>). Their force here lies in the contrast drawn between those from whose frown or scorn the disciples were now shrinking, and the bright hosts in whose presence the faithless should be put to shame when the Son of Man should come in His glory. They were to look on this picture and on that, and ask themselves which ordeal was the most terrible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - Our Lord here looks onward to the day of judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever shall be ashamed of me</span>. "Whosoever:" the word includes all, whatever their position or circumstances may be. "Shall be ashamed of me;" that is, shall deny my faith, or blush to confess me here. <span class="cmt_word">Of him shall the Son of man be ashamed</span>; that is, Christ will despise him, when he shall appear with power and great glory, in that sublime majesty which he gained by his death upon the cross. <span class="cmt_word">In this adulterous and sinful</span> <span class="cmt_word">generation.</span> It adds to the disgrace of being ashamed of Christ that the shame is manifested in the presence of the base and the worthless; and therefore our Lord exhibits the contrast between the mean and contemptible people in the presence of whom men are ashamed of him here, and the magnificent assemblage in whose presence he will be ashamed of them hereafter. The cross of Christ appeared to the great body of mankind to be shameful and contemptible. To the Jews it was a stumbling-block, and to the Greek's foolishness. Hence vast numbers, whether through shame or fear, did not dare to confess it, and still less to preach it. And therefore it is that St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>:l6), "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:34-38 Frequent notice is taken of the great flocking there was to Christ for help in various cases. All are concerned to know this, if they expect him to heal their souls. They must not indulge the ease of the body. As the happiness of heaven with Christ, is enough to make up for the loss of life itself for him, so the gain of all the world in sin, will not make up for the ruin of the soul by sin. And there is a day coming, when the cause of Christ will appear as glorious, as some now think it mean and contemptible. May we think of that season, and view every earthly object as we shall do at that great day.</body></html>
