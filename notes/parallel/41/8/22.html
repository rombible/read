Judging by the localities named previously, Dalmanutha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-10.htm" title="And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.">Mark 8:10</a>), the passage across the lake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-13.htm" title="And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.">Mark 8:13</a>), and afterwards "the villages of Caesarea Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-27.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Whom do men say that I am?">Mark 8:27</a>), it is probable that this was the Bethsaida on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - This miracle is recorded by St. Mark alone. <span class="cmt_word">And he cometh to Bethsaida</span>.

It seems most probable that it was Bethsaida Julias. This Bethsaida was in the tetrarchy of Philip, who improved and adorned it, and named it Julias, in honor of the emperor's daughter Julia. A reference to Ver. 27 seems to make it quite clear that it must have been this Bethsaida, and not the Galilean Bethsaida on the other side of the lake. It is not surprising that there should have been, adjoining this great lake, more than one place called Beth-saida, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "place of fish." <span class="cmt_word">And they bring a blind man unto him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and besought</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> literally, <span class="accented">beseech -</span> him to touch him. St. Mark is fond of the graphic present. There is here, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-32.htm">Mark 7:32</a>, something almost like dictating the mode of cure. They seem to have imagined that the healing virtue could not go forth from Christ except by actual contact. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-26 Here is a blind man brought to Christ by his friends. Therein appeared the faith of those that brought him. If those who are spiritually blind, do not pray for themselves, yet their friends and relations should pray for them, that Christ would be pleased to touch them. The cure was wrought gradually, which was not usual in our Lord's miracles. Christ showed in what method those commonly are healed by his grace, who by nature are spiritually blind. At first, their knowledge is confused; but, like the light of the morning, it shines more and more to the perfect day, and then they see all things clearly. Slighting Christ's favours is forfeiting them; and he will make those who do so know the worth of privileges by the want of them.</body></html>
