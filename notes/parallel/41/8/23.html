As far as the first three Gospels are concerned, these are the two instances of the "spitting" here recorded, but it is one of the links that connect St. Mark with the fourth Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm" title="When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,">John 9:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">If he saw ought.</span>--The better MSS. give the very words, "Dost thou see ought?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">took hold of - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the blind man by the hand, and led him</span> - this is the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>; but a great weight of manuscript authority points to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as the better reading, <span class="accented">brought him - <span class="cmt_word"></span>out of the village</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). This Bethsaida was a village; but Philip had raised it to the rank of a city (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), though it still seems to have retained its old appellation. Our Lord "led" or "brought" the blind man out of Beth-saida, for the same reason that he led the deaf and dumb man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>) away from the multitude: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for the sake of prayer, that he might collect his mind, and unite himself more closely to God, and pray more intently and earnestly; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he might shun vain-glory and human praise, and teach us to shun it also. <span class="cmt_word">And when he had spit on his eyes</span> - this act had a mystical meaning; it was the instrument by which his Deity operated - <span class="cmt_word">and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught?</span> Here were three acts - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the spitting, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the laying of the hands on him, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the questioning of him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We gather from ver. 25 that our Lord's hands were applied to the blind man's eyes. From the analogy of the miracle in the last chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>), we may perhaps infer that our Lord touched the man's eyes with saliva on his finger, and that the hands were withdrawn before he asked him if he saw aught. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-26 Here is a blind man brought to Christ by his friends. Therein appeared the faith of those that brought him. If those who are spiritually blind, do not pray for themselves, yet their friends and relations should pray for them, that Christ would be pleased to touch them. The cure was wrought gradually, which was not usual in our Lord's miracles. Christ showed in what method those commonly are healed by his grace, who by nature are spiritually blind. At first, their knowledge is confused; but, like the light of the morning, it shines more and more to the perfect day, and then they see all things clearly. Slighting Christ's favours is forfeiting them; and he will make those who do so know the worth of privileges by the want of them.</body></html>
