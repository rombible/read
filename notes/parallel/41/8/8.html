Wycliffe renders it, "were fulfilled;" according to the original meaning of "to fulfill," namely, "to fill full." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets</span> - as many as there were loaves. In the record of the other similar miracle, the number of baskets corresponded to the number of the disciples. Here, as in the former miracle, far more food remained after all were fed than the original supply on which our Lord exercised his miraculous power; for each basket would contain much more than one loaf. The Greek word here rendered "basket" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) is a different word from that used for "basket" in the record of the other miracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-43.htm">Mark 6:43</a>). There it is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was a hand-basket of stout wicker-work. The was a much larger basket, made of a more flexible material, perhaps "rushes," like our "frail." It was by means of such a basket, called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>, that St. Paul was let down through a window at Damascus. This supplies another evidence, if it were needed, that these two recorded miracles took place on different occasions. Cornelius a Lapido mentions an opinion that the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> was double the size of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a large basket carried by two. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-10 Our Lord Jesus encouraged the meanest to come to him for life and grace. Christ knows and considers our frames. The bounty of Christ is always ready; to show that, he repeated this miracle. His favours are renewed, as our wants and necessities are. And those need not fear want, who have Christ to live upon by faith, and do so with thanksgiving.</body></html>
