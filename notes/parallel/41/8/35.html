Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.">John 18:37</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - Because the cross is sharp and afflicting, our Lord animates his followers to bear it by the thought of its great and everlasting rewards. The meaning of the verse is this: he who by trying to shun the cross and to escape self-denial would save his life here, will lose it hereafter. But he who loses his life here for the sake of Christ, either by dying in his cause or by denying and mortifying his lusts out of love for him, he in the life to come shall find his life in the bosom of Christ and in eternal joy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:34-38 Frequent notice is taken of the great flocking there was to Christ for help in various cases. All are concerned to know this, if they expect him to heal their souls. They must not indulge the ease of the body. As the happiness of heaven with Christ, is enough to make up for the loss of life itself for him, so the gain of all the world in sin, will not make up for the ruin of the soul by sin. And there is a day coming, when the cause of Christ will appear as glorious, as some now think it mean and contemptible. May we think of that season, and view every earthly object as we shall do at that great day.</body></html>
