It seems to have been interpolated to help the construction. St. Mark explains the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> (literally, common), by the word (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) "unwashen." The disciples, doubtless, washed their hands, but they abstained from the multiplied ceremonial washings of the Pharisees, which they had received by tradition and punctiliously observed. The scribes and Pharisees, who had come from Jerusalem, were doubtless sent as spies, to watch and to report in no friendly spirit the proceedings of the great Prophet of Nazareth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 One great design of Christ's coming was, to set aside the ceremonial law; and to make way for this, he rejects the ceremonies men added to the law of God's making. Those clean hands and that pure heart which Christ bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are very different from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees of every age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. It is clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, to relieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to die that curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if a man conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a device to free him from the claim of this duty.</body></html>
