The latter city lay about twenty miles to the north. Accepting this reading, it marks the extreme limit of our Lord's journeyings--we can hardly say of His ministry, for there is no indication that He went there as a preacher of the Kingdom. We may however, perhaps, trace the feeling which prompted the visit in the words, "It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-14.htm" title="But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.">Luke 10:14</a>, and in the "Other sheep, not of this fold," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Decapolis.</span>--Another instance of St. Mark's use of a Roman nomenclature. St. Matthew says simply, "He departed thence, and came by the Sea of Galilee." For Decapolis, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-25.htm" title="And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.">Matthew 4:25</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - According to the most approved authorities this verse should be read thus: <span class="cmt_word">And again he went out from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.</span> St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-29.htm">Matthew 15:29</a>) simply says that he "departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee." But from the more full statement of St. Mark we learn that he made a circuit, going first northwards through Phoenicia, with Galilee on his right, as far as Sidon; and thence probably over the spurs of Libanus to Damascus, mentioned by Pliny as one of the cities of the Decapolis. This would bring him probably through Caesarea Philippi to the eastern coast of the Sea of Galilee. Here, according to St. Matthew, he remained for a time in the mountainous district above the plain; choosing this position apparently for the sake of quiet and retirement, as also that, being conspicuous to all from the mountain, he might there await the multitude coming to him, whether for instruction or for healing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:31-37 Here is a cure of one that was deaf and dumb. Those who brought this poor man to Christ, besought him to observe the case, and put forth his power. Our Lord used more outward actions in the doing of this cure than usual. These were only signs of Christ's power to cure the man, to encourage his faith, and theirs that brought him. Though we find great variety in the cases and manner of relief of those who applied to Christ, yet all obtained the relief they sought. Thus it still is in the great concerns of our souls.</body></html>
