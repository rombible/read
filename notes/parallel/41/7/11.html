It occurs frequently in Leviticus and Numbers (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-5.htm" title="And if your oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.">Leviticus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-3.htm" title="And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.">Numbers 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-5.htm" title="Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.">Numbers 7:5</a>), and is translated generally by "offering," sometimes by "oblation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-13.htm" title="And every oblation of your meat offering shall you season with salt; neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meat offering: with all your offerings you shall offer salt.">Leviticus 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-1.htm" title="And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.">Leviticus 3:1</a>), but elsewhere in the Old Testament it only appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm" title="For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet smell, and poured out there their drink offerings.">Ezekiel 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-43.htm" title="And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.">Ezekiel 40:43</a>. It had come to be applied specifically (as in the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-6.htm" title="And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.">Matthew 27:6</a>; Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> ii. 9, ? 4) to the sacred treasure of the Temple.<p><span class= "bld">He shall be free.</span>--The words, as the italics show, have nothing corresponding to them in the Greek, nor are they needed, if only, with some MSS., we strike out the conjunction "and" from the next verse. So the sentence runs, <span class= "ital">"If a man shall say . . . ye suffer him no more</span> . . ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God</span> - these words, "that is to say, Given to God," are St. Mark's explanation of "corban" <span class="cmt_word">- ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother; making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered</span>. Now, this the scribes and Pharisees did for their own covetous ends. For most of them were priests, who received offerings made to God as his ministers, and then converted them to their own uses. In this they greatly erred; because the obligation of piety by which children are bound to support their parents when they need it, is a part of the law of nature, to which every vow, every oblation, ought to yield. Thus, if any one had devoted his goods to God, and his father or his mother became needy, those goods ought to be given to his parents and not to the temple. The word "corban" is a Hebrew word, meaning "that which is brought near," "a gift or offering to God." Hence, figuratively, the place where these offerings were deposited was called the "corbanas," or, "sacred treasury" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-6.htm">Matthew 27:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>). Hence to say of anything, "It is Corban," was to say that it had a prior and more sacred destination. And when it was something that a parent might need, to say, "It is Corban," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is already appropriated to another purpose, was simply to refuse his request and to deny him assistance, and so to break one of the first of the Divine commandments. Thus the son, by crying "Corban" to his needy parents, shut their mouths, by opposing to them a scruple of conscience, and suggesting to them a superstitious fear. It was as much as to say, "That which you ask of me is a sacred thing which I have devoted to God. Beware, therefore, lest you, by asking this of me, commit sacrilege by converting it to your own uses." Thus the parents would be silenced and alarmed, choosing rather to perish of hunger than to rob God. To such extremities did these covetous scribes and Pharisees drive their victims, compelling a son to abstain from any kind offices for his father or his mother. St. Ambrose says, "God does not seek a gift wrung out of the necessities of parents." <span class="accented">Making void</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">depriving it of its authority</span>, <span class="accented">annulling.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a> the same word is rendered "disannul." <span class="accented">By your traditions</span>; the traditions, that is, by which they taught children to say "Corban" to their parents. Observe the words, "your tradition" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); your tradition, as opposed to those Divine traditions which God has sanctified, and his Church has handed down from the beginning. <span class="cmt_word">And many such like things ye do</span>. This is added by St. Mark to fill up the outline, and to show that this was only a sample of the many ways in which the commandment of God was twisted, distorted, and annulled by these rabbinical traditions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 One great design of Christ's coming was, to set aside the ceremonial law; and to make way for this, he rejects the ceremonies men added to the law of God's making. Those clean hands and that pure heart which Christ bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are very different from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees of every age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. It is clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, to relieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to die that curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if a man conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a device to free him from the claim of this duty.</body></html>
