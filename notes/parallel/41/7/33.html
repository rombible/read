(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-29.htm" title="Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you.">Matthew 9:29</a>.) Here the man could not find in the pitying tones of the voice of the Healer that on which his faith could fasten, and the act came in to fill up the void.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took him aside from the multitude privately</span>. This was done, no doubt, to fix the attention of the afflicted man upon himself, and upon the fact that he was about to act upon his ears and his tongue. <span class="cmt_word">And he put</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>) - literally, cast or <span class="accented">thrust - <span class="cmt_word"></span>his fingers into his</span> <span class="cmt_word">ears.</span> The action was very significant. It was as though he said, "I am about to open a passage for hearing through these ears." <span class="cmt_word">And he spat, and touched his tongue;</span> that is, he touched his tongue with saliva from his own sacred lips. These symbolical actions must have had a great meaning for the afflicted man. They were a <span class="accented">tableau vivant</span>, an acted metaphor, teaching him what he might expect from the mercy of Christ. The analogy of the miracle recorded in St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6</a>) should be noticed here. It is an interesting circumstance (noticed in the 'Speaker's Commentary') that, in the Latin Church, the officiating priest touches the nostrils and ears of those who are to be baptized, with saliva from his own mouth. We may be assured that, in the case before us, these signs used by our Lord were intended to awaken the afflicted man's faith, and to stir up in him the lively expectation of a blessing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:31-37 Here is a cure of one that was deaf and dumb. Those who brought this poor man to Christ, besought him to observe the case, and put forth his power. Our Lord used more outward actions in the doing of this cure than usual. These were only signs of Christ's power to cure the man, to encourage his faith, and theirs that brought him. Though we find great variety in the cases and manner of relief of those who applied to Christ, yet all obtained the relief they sought. Thus it still is in the great concerns of our souls.</body></html>
