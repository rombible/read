These also had to be scrupulously washed, because it was possible that a heathen might have lain on them. The word is, perhaps, used in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm" title="And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?">Mark 4:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they come from the market</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">and from the market-place</span>; there is no verb in the principal manuscripts, although the Cambridge Codex has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the old Latin gives <span class="accented">redeuntes.</span> In the market-place there would be every kind of men and things, clean and unclean, by contact with which they feared that they might be polluted; and so they considered that they had need to cleanse themselves from this impurity by a more careful and complete ablution. Another Greek word is used here, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. In the former verse the word is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, a more partial and superficial kind of washing than that implied in <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>. It should, however, be added that two of the great uncials, Vatican and Sinaitic, have <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "sprinkle themselves," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x28;</span> an authority sufficient to justify the Revisers of 1881 in putting it into the margin. <span class="cmt_word">The washing of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels, and of tables</span>. The words (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) wrongly rendered, "and of tables" - because they could only mean "couches" - have not sufficient authority to be retained in the text. "Cups" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) mean "drinking vessels." The "pot" (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>) is a Roman word, <span class="accented">sextarius</span>, a small liquid measure, the sixth part of a <span class="accented">congius</span>, corresponding nearly to the English gallon, so that <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> would be rather more than a pint measure. Brasen v<span class="accented">essels.</span> These would probably be copper vessels, such as are still used in Syria for cooking purposes. These are particularly mentioned. Earthenware vessels would be broken. <span class="cmt_word">Which they have received to hold</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">which they received to hold</span>: observe the aorist. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 One great design of Christ's coming was, to set aside the ceremonial law; and to make way for this, he rejects the ceremonies men added to the law of God's making. Those clean hands and that pure heart which Christ bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are very different from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees of every age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. It is clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, to relieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to die that curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if a man conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a device to free him from the claim of this duty.</body></html>
