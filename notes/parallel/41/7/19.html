The "heart" is, after the common Hebrew idiom, the symbol of the mind as well as the affections. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm" title="And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,">Proverbs 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm" title="Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,">Proverbs 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm" title="Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: and as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,">Proverbs 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm" title="In the lips of him that has understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.">Proverbs 10:13</a>, in all of which "understanding" stands for the Hebrew of "heart.")<p><span class= "bld">Purging all meats.</span>--This also is peculiar to St. Mark, and presents some difficulties. In the commonly received text, the participle is in the neuter nominative, agreeing with the nominative to the verb "goeth out." But in this construction it is difficult to see in what sense that which goeth into the mouth--itself an article of food, with no special character--can be said to purge or cleanse all other forms of food. The better MSS., however, give the participle in the masculine. This has been explained by many as a grammatical anomaly, and the participle being treated as if it agreed (though in a different case) with the word "draught" or "cesspool," the latter is said to cleanse all meats, as removing the <span class= "ital">excreta,</span> or impure parts, from them, and leaving only that which nourishes the body. A far better construction, both as to grammar and meaning, is found by making the word "purging," or better, <span class= "ital">cleansing,</span> agree with the subject of the verb "He saith," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-18.htm" title="And he said to them, Are you so without understanding also? Do you not perceive, that whatever thing from without enters into the man, it cannot defile him;">Mark 7:18</a>--"He saith this . . . and in so saying, cleanseth all meats." So taken, the words anticipate, in almost the same terms, the truth of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 10:15</a>, "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common." The construction is tenable grammatically, has the support of high authority both ancient and modern, and obviously gives a much better sense. It is a possible conjecture that the words "cleansing all meats" may have been, at first, a marginal note (like the addition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-16.htm" title="If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.">Mark 7:16</a>), attached to "He saith," and have afterwards found their way into the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-23 Our wicked thoughts and affections, words and actions, defile us, and these only. As a corrupt fountain sends forth corrupt streams, so does a corrupt heart send forth corrupt reasonings, corrupt appetites and passions, and all the wicked words and actions that come from them. A spiritual understanding of the law of God, and a sense of the evil of sin, will cause a man to seek for the grace of the Holy Spirit, to keep down the evil thoughts and affections that work within.</body></html>
