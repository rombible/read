In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?">1Samuel 21:1</a>, Ahimelech is named as exercising the high priest's office in the Tabernacle at Nob. He is slain by Doeg, at the command of Saul, and his son Abiathar joins David at the cave of Adullam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm" title="And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.">1Samuel 22:20</a>), and continues to act as high priest till his deposition by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm" title="And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.">1Kings 2:26</a>). Two conjectural explanations suggest themselves as probable: (1) that St. Mark, or that our Lord, may have given the name of the more famous priest of the two, who, though not then high-priest, was at the Tabernacle at the time referred to; (2) that he might have acted then as a coadjutor to his father, as Eli's sons seem to have done to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm" title="So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.">1Samuel 4:4</a>), and being, as his flight showed, of David's party, was the chief agent in allowing him to take the shew-bread.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:23-28 The sabbath is a sacred and Divine institution; a privilege and benefit, not a task and drudgery. God never designed it to be a burden to us, therefore we must not make it so to ourselves. The sabbath was instituted for the good of mankind, as living in society, having many wants and troubles, preparing for a state of happiness or misery. Man was not made for the sabbath, as if his keeping it could be of service to God, nor was he commanded to keep it outward observances to his real hurt. Every observance respecting it, is to be interpreted by the rule of mercy.</body></html>
