Galilee had been specially designated as the scene of the Divine manifestation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1, 2</a>). The land of Galilee, or of Zebulun and Naphtali, had the misfortune to be the first in the sad calamity which fell upon the Jewish nation through the Assyrian invasion; and, in order to console them under this grievious affliction, Isaiah assures them that, by way of recompense, they, above the rest of their brethren, should have the chief share in the presence and ministry of the future promised Messiah. It seems probable that our Lord remained some time in Judaea after his baptism. From thence he went, with Andrew and Peter, two of John's disciples, into Galilee, where he called Philip. And then it was that he turned the water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana. This was his first coming out of Judaea into Galilee, related by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>, etc.). But the Passover brought him back into Judaea, that he might present himself in the temple; and then occurred his first purging of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-14.htm">John 2:14</a>). Then came the visit of Nicedemus to him by night; and then he began openly to preach and to baptize (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>), and thus incurred the envy of the scribes and Pharisees. Therefore he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee; and this is the departure here recorded by St. Mark and by St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>). Hence it came to pass that it was in Galilee that Christ called to himself four fishermen - Andrew and Peter, James and John. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:14-22 Jesus began to preach in Galilee, after that John was put in prison. If some be laid aside, others shall be raised up, to carry on the same work. Observe the great truths Christ preached. By repentance we give glory to our Creator whom we have offended; by faith we give glory to our Redeemer who came to save us from our sins. Christ has joined these two together, and let no man think to put them asunder. Christ puts honour upon those who, though mean in this world, are diligent in their business and kind to one another. Industry and unity are good and pleasant, and the Lord Jesus commands a blessing on them. Those whom Christ calls, must leave all to follow him; and by his grace he makes them willing to do so. Not that we must needs go out of the world, but we must sit loose to the world; forsake every thing that is against our duty to Christ, and that cannot be kept without hurt to our souls. Jesus strictly kept the sabbath day, by applying himself unto, and abounding in the sabbath work, in order to which the sabbath rest was appointed. There is much in the doctrine of Christ that is astonishing; and the more we hear it, the more cause we see to admire it.</body></html>
