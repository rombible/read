The definite statement who they were that followed after Him is, however, peculiar to St. Mark; while St. Luke alone gives their motive: "they stayed Him that He should not depart from them." They would fain have kept Him at Capernaum, that He might teach them and heal their sick. This is to some extent, perhaps, implied in the words "All men seek for Thee."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> the word implies an "earnest pursuing." They that were with him would doubtless include Andrew and James and John, and probably others whose enthusiasm had been kindled by Simon Peter. St. Luke, in the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-42.htm">Luke 4:42</a>). tells us that "the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:29-39 Wherever Christ comes, he comes to do good. He cures, that we may minister to him, and to others who are his, and for his sake. Those kept from public ordinances by sickness or other real hinderances, may expect the Saviour's gracious presence; he will soothe their sorrows, and abate their pains. Observe how numerous the patients were. When others speed well with Christ, it should quicken us in seeking after him. Christ departed into a solitary place. Though he was in no danger of distraction, or of temptation to vain-glory, yet he retired. Those who have the most business in public, and of the best kind, must yet sometimes be alone with God.</body></html>
