This was a rough, coarse garment, characteristic of the doctrine which John taught, namely, penitence and contempt of the world. Camels abounded in Syria. <span class="cmt_word">And a leathern girdle about his loins</span>. Not only the prophets, but the Jews and the inhabitants of Syria generally, used a girdle to keep the long flowing garment more closely about them, so as to leave them more free for journeying or for labour. Thus our Lord says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>), "Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning." <span class="cmt_word">And he did eat locusts and wild</span> <span class="cmt_word">honey.</span> The insect called the locust (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>) was permitted to be eaten (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>). It was used as food by the common people in Judaea. The Arabs eat them to this day; but they are considered as a common and inferior kind of food. They are a sign of temperance, poverty, and penitence. The wild honey (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) was simply honey made by wild bees, either in the trees or in the hollows of the rocks. Isidorus says that it was of an inferior flavour. Both these kinds of food were consistent with the austere life and the solemn preaching of the Baptist. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8. Isaiah and Malachi each spake concerning the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, in the ministry of John. From these prophets we may observe, that Christ, in his gospel, comes among us, bringing with him a treasure of grace, and a sceptre of government. Such is the corruption of the world, that there is great opposition to his progress. When God sent his Son into the world, he took care, and when he sends him into the heart, he takes care, to prepare his way before him. John thinks himself unworthy of the meanest office about Christ. The most eminent saints have always been the most humble. They feel their need of Christ's atoning blood and sanctifying Spirit, more than others. The great promise Christ makes in his gospel to those who have repented, and have had their sins forgiven them, is, they shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost; shall be purified by his graces, and refreshed by his comforts. We use the ordinances, word, and sacraments without profit and comfort, for the most part, because we have not of that Divine light within us; and we have it not because we ask it not; for we have his word that cannot fail, that our heavenly Father will give this light, his Holy Spirit, to those that ask it.</body></html>
