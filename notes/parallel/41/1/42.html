There is no interval between the command and the work of Christ. "He spake, and it was done." His will is his omnipotence. By this act Christ showed that he came into the world as a great Physician, that he might cure all diseases, and cleanse us from all our defilements. The word "straightway" shows that Christ healed the leper, not by any natural means, but by a Divine power which works instantly. He is alike powerful both to commend and to do. St. Matthew says here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>) that straightway "his leprosy was cleansed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). There is here what is called a "hypallage," or inversion of the meaning, which is, of course, that "he was cleansed from his leprosy." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:40-45 We have here Christ's cleansing of a leper. It teaches us to apply to the Saviour with great humility, and with full submission to his will, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, without any doubt of Christ's readiness to help the distressed. See also what to expect from Christ; that according to our faith it shall be to us. The poor leper said, If thou wilt. Christ readily wills favours to those who readily refer themselves to his will. Christ would have nothing done that looked like seeking praise of the people. But no reasons now exist why we should hesitate to spread the praises of Christ.</body></html>
