The reproduction of the words which are recorded as having been spoken in the Sermon on the Mount, is very significant. The prayer even of intensest faith is not perfect, unless the temper of the worshipper is also that of the Charity which forgives offences. Such words exclude from the prayers of Christ's disciples wishes more or less vindictive, which, as in Psalms 69, 109, had seemed natural and right under a less perfect manifestation of the will and mind of the Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And wheresoever ye stand praying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). The ordinary attitude of Eastern nations in prayer is here indicated, namely, "standing," with the head, doubtless, bowed in reverence. The promise of this text is that requests offered in prayer by a faithful heart will be granted - granted as God knows best. The connection of these verses with the former is close. One great hindrance to the faith without which there can be no spiritual power, is the presence of angry and uncharitable feelings. These must all be put away if we would hope for a favorable answer from God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:19-26 The disciples could not think why that fig-tree should so soon wither away; but all wither who reject Christ; it represented the state of the Jewish church. We should rest in no religion that does not make us fruitful in good works. Christ taught them from hence to pray in faith. It may be applied to that mighty faith with which all true Christians are endued, and which does wonders in spiritual things. It justifies us, and so removes mountains of guilt, never to rise up in judgment against us. It purifies the heart, and so removes mountains of corruption, and makes them plain before the grace of God.
