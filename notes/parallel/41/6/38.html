St. John tells us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>) that the loaves were of barley, and that the fishes were small (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>); St. Mark says <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Barley bread was considered an inferior and homely kind of food, very inferior to bread made of wheat flour. The comparative value of the two kinds of bread is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>. "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny." The psalmist alludes to the greater excellence of wheat flour: "He would have fed them also with the finest wheat flour" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:30-44 Let not ministers do any thing or teach any thing, but what they are willing should be told to their Lord. Christ notices the frights of some, and the toils of others of his disciples, and provides rest for those that are tired, and refuge for those that are terrified. The people sought the spiritual food of Christ's word, and then he took care that they should not want bodily food. If Christ and his disciples put up with mean things, surely we may. And this miracle shows that Christ came into the world, not only to restore, but to preserve and nourish spiritual life; in him there is enough for all that come. None are sent empty away from Christ but those who come to him full of themselves. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he teaches us not to waste any of God's bounties, remembering how many are in want. We may, some time, need the fragments that we now throw away.</body></html>
