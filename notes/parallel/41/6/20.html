In English, however, to "keep" a man is ambiguous, and the "observed" of our version seems on the whole preferable to any other.<p><span class= "bld">He did many things.</span>--The better MSS. give, "he was much perplexed."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The words in the Authorized Version are, <span class="cmt_word">When he heard him, he did many things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and heard him gladly</span>. But according to the best authorities the reading should be (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), <span class="accented">he was much perplexed.</span> In St. Luke, as stated above, we have (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), "he was much perplexed." Nor is there any inconsistency in the next clause in St. Mark, if we accept this reading. Herod was not utterly depraved. There was to him a charm, not only in the character, but in the discourses of John the Baptist. But he was an inconsistent man, and was continually the victim of a conflict between the good and the evil within him, in which evil, alas! triumphed. Herodias, on the other hand, had always wished to get rid of John, as the stern and uncompromising reprover of her adultery and incest; and so at length she persuaded Herod to give way. "For," says Bede, "she feared lest Herod should at length repent, and yield to the exhortations of John, and dissolve this unreal marriage, and restore Herodias to her lawful husband." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:14-29 Herod feared John while he lived, and feared him still more when he was dead. Herod did many of those things which John in his preaching taught him; but it is not enough to do many things, we must have respect to all the commandments. Herod respected John, till he touched him in his Herodias. Thus many love good preaching, if it keep far away from their beloved sin. But it is better that sinners persecute ministers now for faithfulness, than curse them eternally for unfaithfulness. The ways of God are unsearchable; but we may be sure he never can be at a loss to repay his servants for what they endure or lose for his sake. Death could not come so as to surprise this holy man; and the triumph of the wicked was short.</body></html>
