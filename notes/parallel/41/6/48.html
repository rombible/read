The Greek is, according to the best readings <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> means more than "toiling;" it means literally, <span class="accented">tormented.</span> It is well rendered in the Revised Version by <span class="accented">distressed</span>. It was only by painful effort that they could make head against the driving storm blowing upon them from the west, that is, from the Mediterranean Sea. <span class="cmt_word">About the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea</span>. The Jews formerly divided the night into three watches; but when Judaea became a Roman province they adopted the Roman division. The Romans changed the watches every three hours, lest through too long watches the guards might slumber at their posts. These periods were called "watches." If the night was short, they divided it into three watches; if long, into four. Therefore the fourth watch began at the tenth hour of the night, that is, at three o'clock in the morning, and continued to the twelfth, that is, to six o'clock. It would seem, therefore, that this storm lasted for nine hours. During that time the disciples had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, that is about three Roman miles - eight furlongs - making a mile. The Sea of Galilee is not more than six miles broad at its widest part. They were therefore now (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) "in the midst of the sea," as St. Mark expresses it; so that, after rowing for nine hours, they had hardly crossed more than half over the sea. The Sea of Galilee is, speaking roughly, about twelve miles from north to south and six from east to west. It may be asked why our Lord suffered them to be tempest-tossed so long; and the answer is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It was a trial of their faith, so as to urge them to seek more earnestly the help of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It was a lesson to accustom them to endure bard-ness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It made the stilling of so tedious and dangerous a storm all the more grateful and welcome to them at last. The Fathers find a fine spiritual meaning in this. Jerome says, "The fourth watch is the <span class="accented">last."</span> So, too, St. Augustine, who adds that "he who has watched the ship of his Church will come at length at the fourth watch, at the end of the world, when the night of sin and evil is ended, to judge the quick and the dead." Theophylact says, "He allows his disciples to be tried by dangers, that they may be taught patience, and does not come to them till morning, that they may learn perseverance and faith." Hilary says, "The <span class="accented">first</span> watch was the age of the Law, the <span class="accented">second</span> of the prophets, the <span class="accented">third</span> of the gospel, the <span class="accented">fourth</span> of his glorious advent, when he will find her buffeted by the spirit of antichrist and by the storms of the world. And by his reception into the ship and the consequent calm is prefigured the eternal peace of the Church after his second coming" (see Wordsworth's 'New Testament:'St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14.htm">Matthew 14</a>). <span class="accented">He walked on the sea</span>. This he did by his Divine power, which he possessed as God, and which, when he pleased, he could assume as man. Infidelity is at fault here. Paulus the rationalist, revived the ridiculous idea that Christ walking on the sea merely meant Christ walking on the shore, elevated above the sea; but the interpretation was rightly denounced by Lavater as "a laughable insult on logic, hermeneutics, good sense, and honesty." Was it because our Lord simply walked on the shore that the disciples "cried out and were troubled"? Was it merely for this that they were "sore amazed at themselves beyond measure and wondered"? Yet such are the shifts to which unbelief is reduced when it ventures to measure itself against the acts of Omnipotence. <span class="cmt_word">He would have passed</span> <span class="cmt_word">by them.</span> An expression something like that in St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-28.htm">Luke 24:28</a>), "He made as though he would go further," although there the Greek in St. Luke is different (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Here it is <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">he wished to pass by them</span>; so at least it appeared to the disciples. It has been suggested that our Lord did this that the disciples might more clearly see how the wind was stilled in his presence. <span class="cmt_word">They supposed that it was an apparition</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a phantom.</span> Why did they suppose this? Partly from the idea that spectres appear in the night and in the darkness to terrify men, and partly because in the darkness they could not so readily recognize that it was Jesus. Then the fact that our Lord" would bare passed by them," flitting past them as though he eared nothing for them and had nothing to do with them, but was going elsewhere; this must have increased their terror. But now came the moment for him to calm their fears. Straightway he talked with them soothingly. <span class="cmt_word">Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid</span>. Now, Christ did this that he might teach his disciples to conquer fear and temptation, even when they are very great, and that so the deliverance and the consolation might impress them all the more powerfully and sweetly in proportion to their former terror. "'It is I' - I, your Lord and Master, whom you know so well, and of whose goodness and omnipotence you have already had so much experience; I, your Master, who do not come to mock you as a phantom, but to deliver you both from fear and from storm." It will be observed that St. Mark omits all mention of Peter's act of faith "in going down from the boat, and walking upon the waters to come to Jesus," as recorded by St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28</a>). Throughout this Gospel, as already noticed, St. Peter is kept in the background. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:45-56 The church is often like a ship at sea, tossed with tempests, and not comforted: we may have Christ for us, yet wind and tide against us; but it is a comfort to Christ's disciples in a storm, that their Master is in the heavenly mount, interceding for them. And no difficulties can hinder Christ's appearance for his people, when the set time is come. He silenced their fears, by making himself known to them. Our fears are soon satisfied, if our mistakes are set right, especially our mistakes as to Christ. Let the disciples have their Master with them, and all is well. It is for want of rightly understanding Christ's former works, that we view his present works as if there never were the like before. If Christ's ministers now could cure people's bodily diseases, what multitudes would flock after them! It is sad to think how much more most care about their bodies than about their souls.</body></html>
