In addition an interesting illustration of what is stated as to Herod's belief may be given from the Roman poet Persius. He is describing in one of his satires (v. 180-188) the effect of superstitious fear in marring all the pleasures of the pride of luxurious pomp, and this is the illustration which he chooses:--<p>"But when the feast of Herod's birthday comes,<p>And, through the window, smoke-besmeared, the lamps,<p>Set in due order, wreaths of violets round,<p>Pour out their oily fumes, and in the dish<p>Of red-clay porcelain tail of tunny swims,<p>And the white flagon bellies out with wine,<p>Thou mov'st thy lips, yet speak'st not, and in fear<p>Thou keep'st the Sabbath of the circumcised,<p>And then there rise dark spectres of the dead,<p>And the cracked egg-shell bodes of coming ill . . .<p>It is clear that a description so minute in its details must have been photographed, as it were, from some actual incident, and could not have been merely a general picture of the prevalence of Jewish superstition in Roman society. Commentators on the Roman poet have, however, failed to find any clue to the incident thus graphically related. Can we, starting from what the Gospels tell us as to the character of Antipas, picture to ourselves a scene that explains his strange mysterious hints? In A.D. 39 Herod Agrippa I., the nephew of the Tetrarch, obtained the title of king from the Emperor Caligula. Prompted by the ambition of Herodias, Antipas went with her to Rome, to seek, by lavish gifts and show of state, the same distinction. The emissaries of Agrippa, however, thwarted his schemes, and he was deposed and sent into exile at Lugdunum. May we not conjecture that the same superstitious terror which made him say that John the Baptist was risen from the dead followed him there also? "Herod's birthday" again comes round, and there is a great feast, and instead of the "lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee," senators and courtiers and philosophers are there, and, lo! there is a pause, and the Tetrarch rises in silent horror--as Macbeth at the apparition of Banquo's ghost--and he sees the dark form shaking its gory locks, and his lips move in speechless terror, and he "does many things" on the coming Sabbath, and the thing becomes a by-word and a proverb in the upper circles of Roman society, and is noted in the schools of the Stoics as an illustration of what superstition can effect. The view thus stated is, of course, not more than a conjecture, but it at least explains phenomena. Persius died, at the age of twenty-eight or thirty, in A.D. 62, and may well therefore have heard the matter talked of in his boyhood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - This Herod is called by St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>) "the tetrarch;" and so also by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7</a>); though it should be noticed that St. Matthew, in the same context, at Ver. 9, calls him "king." The word "tetrarch" properly means the sovereign or ruler of the fourth part of a territory. He is known as Herod Anti-pus, son of Herod the Great, who had appointed him "tetrarch" of Galilee and Peraea. Herod Antipas had married the daughter of Arctas, King of Arabia, but deserted her for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. <span class="cmt_word">John the Baptist is risen from the dead</span>; that is, "is risen in the person of Jesus Christ." St. Luke. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7</a>) says that at first Herod was "much perplexed (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)" "about him. At length, however, as he heard more and more of the fame of Christ's miracles, he came to the conclusion that our Lord was none other than John the Baptist risen again. Such is the opinion of St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and others. At that time the views of Pythagoras respecting the transmigration of souls were generally current, and probably influenced the troubled mind of Herod. He had put to death an innocent and holy man; and it is a high testimony to the worth of the Baptist that, under the reproaches of a guilty conscience, Herod should have come to the conclusion that he had risen from the dead, thus probably giving the lie to his own opinions as a Sadducee; and terrified lest the Baptist should now avenge his own murder. "What a great thing," exclaims St. Chrysostom," is virtue! for Herod fears him, even though dead." It should not be forgotten that this is the same Herod who set Jesus at nought and mocked him, when Pilate sent him to him, in the hope of relieving himself of the terrible responsibility of condemning one whom he knew to be innocent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:14-29 Herod feared John while he lived, and feared him still more when he was dead. Herod did many of those things which John in his preaching taught him; but it is not enough to do many things, we must have respect to all the commandments. Herod respected John, till he touched him in his Herodias. Thus many love good preaching, if it keep far away from their beloved sin. But it is better that sinners persecute ministers now for faithfulness, than curse them eternally for unfaithfulness. The ways of God are unsearchable; but we may be sure he never can be at a loss to repay his servants for what they endure or lose for his sake. Death could not come so as to surprise this holy man; and the triumph of the wicked was short.</body></html>
