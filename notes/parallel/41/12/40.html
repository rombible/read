The better MSS., indeed, omit it even there. The relative pronoun gives a wrong idea of the construction. We have really a new sentence. "They that devour . . . these shall receive . . ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - There is a change in the construction here, which is not marked in the Authorized Version. The sentence in this fortieth verse should stand alone, and be read thus: <span class="cmt_word">They which devour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation</span>. The sentence thus read is far more graphic. The statement thus becomes indeed more general, but the reference is still to the scribes who through their avarice swallowed up the property of helpless widows, and through their hypocrisy, in the hope of thus more effectually imposing upon their victims, lengthened out their prayers. <span class="accented">Greater condemnation.</span> The word in the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, that is, "judgment." A severer sentence would fall upon them in the day of judgment and a heavier condemnation, because, under the semblance of piety, they practiced iniquity, and indulged their avarice under the mask of religion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:35-40 When we attend to what the Scriptures declare, as to the person and offices of Christ, we shall be led to confess him as our Lord and God; to obey him as our exalted Redeemer. If the common people hear these things gladly, while the learned and distinguished oppose, the former are happy, and the latter to be pitied. And as sin, disguised with a show of piety, is double iniquity, so its doom will be doubly heavy.</body></html>
