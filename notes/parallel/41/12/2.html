St. Mark, characteristically, seizes on the most vivid presentation of the facts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard</span>. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-34.htm">Matthew 21:34</a>) says he sent "his servants." St. Mark mentions them in detail. These servants were the prophets, as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others, whom the Jews persecuted and slew in different ways, as the reprovers of their vices. But the mercy of God was long-suffering, and still triumphed over their wickedness. In his account of this parable St. Mark is very minute. The first servant that was sent received no fruit, and was beaten. The second received much worse usage. According to the Authorized Version the words are, <span class="cmt_word">At him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is, however, not to be found in the best authorities; and the right reading of the next word is apparently <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> a very unusual word; but the context makes it plain that it expresses some injury done to the head. The other form of the word is usual enough; but it ordinarily signifies "a summing up," "a gathering up into a head." <span class="accented">And handled shamefully</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">dishonored.</span> The third messenger they killed outright. The words run. <span class="cmt_word">And him they killed; and many others; beating some, and killing some</span>. The construction here is incomplete, although the meaning is plain. The complete sentence would be, "And him they killed; and they did violence to many others, beating some and killing some." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-12 Christ showed in parables, that he would lay aside the Jewish church. It is sad to think what base usage God's faithful ministers have met with in all ages, from those who have enjoyed the privileges of the church, but have not brought forth fruit answerable. God at length sent his Son, his Well-beloved; and it might be expected that he whom their Master loved, they also should respect and love; but instead of honouring him because he was the Son and Heir, they therefore hated him. But the exaltation of Christ was the Lord's doing; and it is his doing to exalt him in our hearts, and to set up his throne there; and if this be done, it cannot but be marvellous in our eyes. The Scriptures, and faithful preachers, and the coming of Christ in the flesh, call on us to render due praise to God in our lives. Let sinners beware of a proud, carnal spirit; if they revile or despise the preachers of Christ, they would have done so their Master, had they lived when he was upon earth.</body></html>
