Their absence, seeming, as they do, essential to the meaning of the sentence, is singular. A possible explanation is, that we have an imperfect fragmentary report, as from a note taken at the time, of that which appears, in a developed form, as the parable of the Talents in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-14.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.">Matthew 25:14-30</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And commanded the porter to watch.</span>--This feature is unique in our Lord's parables, and, as such, seems to call for a special interpretation. The "servants" we accept at once as the disciples, and we understand generally what was the authority and the work assigned to them. But who was specifically the "gate-keeper" or "porter"? The answer appears to be found in the promise of the keys of the kingdom that had been made to St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-19.htm" title="And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.">Matthew 16:19</a>). It was his work to open the door of that kingdom wide, to be ready for his Lord's coming in any of those manifold senses which experience would unfold to him. We may accordingly venture to trace in St. Mark's record, here as elsewhere, the influence of the Apostle. That word "the porter" was, he felt, meant for him, and this he remembered when much that had been recorded by others had faded from his recollection. If we adopt this application of the word here, it throws light on the somewhat difficult reference to the "porter" of the sheep-fold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:28-37 We have the application of this prophetic sermon. As to the destruction of Jerusalem, expect it to come very shortly. As to the end of the world, do not inquire when it will come, for of that day and that hour knoweth no man. Christ, as God, could not be ignorant of anything; but the Divine wisdom which dwelt in our Saviour, communicated itself to his human soul according to the Divine pleasure. As to both, our duty is to watch and pray. Our Lord Jesus, when he ascended on high, left something for all his servants to do. We ought to be always upon our watch, in expectation of his return. This applies to Christ's coming to us at our death, as well as to the general judgment. We know not whether our Master will come in the days of youth, or middle age, or old age; but, as soon as we are born, we begin to die, and therefore we must expect death. Our great care must be, that, whenever our Lord comes, he may not find us secure, indulging in ease and sloth, mindless of our work and duty. He says to all, Watch, that you may be found in peace, without spot, and blameless.</body></html>
