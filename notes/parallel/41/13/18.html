According to the best authorities, "your flight" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is omitted, but the meaning remains very much the same. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-20.htm">Matthew 24:20</a>) adds, "neither on a sabbath." But this would be comparatively of little interest to those to whom St. Mark was writing. Our Lord thus specifies the winter, because at that season, on account of the cold and snow, flight would be attended with special difficulty and hardship, and would be almost impossible for the aged and infirm. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:14-23 The Jews in rebelling against the Romans, and in persecuting the Christians, hastened their own ruin apace. Here we have a prediction of that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this. Such destruction and desolation, that the like cannot be found in any history. Promises of power to persevere, and cautions against falling away, well agree with each other. But the more we consider these things, the more we shall see abundant cause to flee without delay for refuge to Christ, and to renounce every earthly object, for the salvation of our souls.</body></html>
