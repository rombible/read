The same fact accounts, perhaps, for the omission by both of the name of Caiaphas as the chief mover in the scheme.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now after two days was the feast</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the passover and the unleavened bread;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the passover and the unleavened</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It was one and the same festival. The killing of the Paschal lamb took place on the first of the seven days during which the festival lasted, and during the whole of which they used unleavened bread. Josephus describes it as "the festival of the unleavened, called <span class="accented">Phaska</span> by the Jews." <span class="cmt_word">The chief priests and the scribes.</span> St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3</a>) says, "The chief priests and the elders of the people." The two classes in the Sanhedrim who actually combined to put our Lord to death were those here mentioned by St. Mark. <span class="cmt_word">They sought how they might take him with subtlety</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and kill him</span>. It is, literally, <span class="accented">they were seeking</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>). The verb with its tense implies continuous and eager desire. They used subtlety, because they feared lest he should escape out of their hands. Moreover they feared the people, lest they should fight for him, and not suffer him to be taken. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 Did Christ pour out his soul unto death for us, and shall we think any thing too precious for him? Do we give him the precious ointment of our best affections? Let us love him with all the heart, though it is common for zeal and affection to be misunderstood and blamed; and remember that charity to the poor will not excuse any from particular acts of piety to the Lord Jesus. Christ commended this woman's pious attention to the notice of believers in all ages. Those who honour Christ he will honour. Covetousness was Judas' master lust, and that betrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; the devil suited his temptation to that, and so conquered him. And see what wicked contrivances many have in their sinful pursuits; but what appears to forward their plans, will prove curses in the end.</body></html>
