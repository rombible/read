The sign of the pitcher of water is common to both Gospels, but not to St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he sendeth two of his disciples</span>. St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8</a>) informs us that these two were Peter and John. It is characteristic of St. Mark's Gospel throughout that Peter is never mentioned oftener than is necessary. <span class="cmt_word">Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water</span>. The bearing of the pitcher of water was not without its meaning. It was a solemn religious act preparatory to the Passover. This man bearing a pitcher of water was not the master or owner of the house. The owner is distinguished afterwards by the name <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or "goodman of the house." The owner must, therefore, have been a man of some substance, and probably a friend if not a disciple of our Lord. Tradition says that this was the house of John whose surname was Mark; and that it was in this house that the disciples were assembled on the evening of our Lord's resurrection, and where, also, they received the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, on the day of Pentecost. It was to this house that Peter betook himself when he was delivered by the angel out of prison. Hence it was known, as one of the earliest places of Christian worship, by the name of "Coenaculum Sion; "and here was built a church, called the Church of Sion. It was the oldest church in Jerusalem, and was called by St. Cyril, "the upper church of the apostles." (See Joseph Mode, p. 322.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:12-21 Nothing could be less the result of human foresight than the events here related. But our Lord knows all things about us before they come to pass. If we admit him, he will dwell in our hearts. The Son of man goes, as it is written of him, as a lamb to the slaughter; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed! God's permitting the sins of men, and bringing glory to himself out of them, does not oblige them to sin; nor will this be any excuse for their guilt, or lessen their punishment.</body></html>
