St. Mark here uses the present participle (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), bringing the action close to the time when he was speaking. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>) has (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) "he that dipped his hand," using the aorist form. St. Mark's form is the more graphic. The dish probably contained a sauce called <span class="accented">charoseth</span>, into which they dipped their food before eating it. The following appears to have been the order of the events: - First, our Lord, before he instituted the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, foretold that he would be betrayed by one of his disciples but only in general terms. Then came the eager question from them, "Is it I?" Then Christ answered that the traitor was he who should dip his hand together with him in the dish. But this did not bring it home to the individual, because several who sat near to him were able to dip with him in the dish. So that our Lord had as yet only obscurely and indefinitely pointed out the traitor. Then he proceeded to institute "the Lord's Supper;" after which he again intimated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-21.htm">Luke 22:21</a>) that "the hand of him that betrayed him was with him on the table." Upon this. St. Peter hinted to St. John, who was "reclining in Jesus' besom," that he should ask him to say definitely and by name who it was that should betray him. Our Lord then said to St. John, "He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>). Our Lord then dipped the sop, and gave it to Judas Iscariot. Then it was that our Lord said to Judas, "That thou doest, do quickly" (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a>). Then Judas went straightway to the house of Caiaphas, and procured the band of men and officers for the completion of his horrible design. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:12-21 Nothing could be less the result of human foresight than the events here related. But our Lord knows all things about us before they come to pass. If we admit him, he will dwell in our hearts. The Son of man goes, as it is written of him, as a lamb to the slaughter; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed! God's permitting the sins of men, and bringing glory to himself out of them, does not oblige them to sin; nor will this be any excuse for their guilt, or lessen their punishment.</body></html>
