The English version assumes that it means "casting his mind or thoughts," just as "to reflect" is "to bend the mind," and is probably right. The marginal readings give two conjectures. Yet another may be found in the idea that the word describes St. Peter's action "casting himself down, he wept," but there is not enough authority for any other interpretation to justify a change in the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 72.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he thought thereon, he wept</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x3b5;</span>,).

Those that are shy of godliness, are far in the way to deny Christ. Those who think it dangerous to be in company with Christ's disciples, because thence they may be drawn in to suffer for him, will find it much more dangerous to be in company with his enemies, because there they may be drawn in to sin against him. When Christ was admired and flocked after, Peter readily owned him; but will own no relation to him now he is deserted and despised. Yet observe, Peter's repentance was very speedy. Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall; and let him that has fallen think of these things, and of his own offences, and return to the Lord with weeping and supplication, seeking forgiveness, and to be raised up by the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
