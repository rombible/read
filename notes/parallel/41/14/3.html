The Greek word implies not so much the breaking of the neck of the costly jar or flask, but the crushing it in its entirety with both her hands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while he was in Bethany, in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">an alabaster</span>; as we say, "a glass," of a vessel made of glass - <span class="cmt_word">of ointment of spikenard very costly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="cmt_word">and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head</span>. This anointing of our Lord appears to have taken place on the Saturday before Palm Sunday (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>). The anointing mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-36.htm">Luke 7:36</a>) evidently has reference to some previous occasion. The narrative here and in St. Matthew and St. John would lead us to the conclusion that this was a feast given by Simon - perhaps in grateful acknowledgment of the miracle which had been wrought upon Lazarus. He is called "Simon the leper," probably because he had been a leper, and had been healed by Christ, although he still retained the name of "leper," to distinguish him from others named Simon, or Simeon, a common name amongst the Jews. <span class="accented">There came a woman.</span> This woman, we learn from St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2, 3</a>), was Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. The vessel, or cruse, which she had with her was made of alabaster, a kind of soft, smooth marble, which could easily be scooped out so as to form a receptacle for ointment, which, according to Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 13:3), was best preserved in vessels made of alabaster. The vessel would probably be formed with a long narrow neck, which could easily be broken, or crushed (the word in the original is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> so as to allow of a free escape for the unguent. The ointment was made of spikenard <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">nardi spicati.</span> If this is the true interpretation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, it would mean that this ointment was made from a bearded plant mentioned by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:12), who says that the ointment made from this plant was most precious. The plant was called by Galen "nardi spica." Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> it would mean "genuine" ointment - ointment made from the flowers of the choicest kind of plant, pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:26) says that there was an inferior article in circulation, which he calls "pseudo-nard." The Syriac Peshito Version uses an expression which means the principal, or best kind of ointment. The anointing of the head would be the more usual mark of honor. It would seem most probable that Mary first wiped the feet of Jesus, wetting them with her tears, and then wiping off the dust, and then anointing them; and that she then proceeded to break the neck of the cruse, and to pour its whole contents on his head. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 Did Christ pour out his soul unto death for us, and shall we think any thing too precious for him? Do we give him the precious ointment of our best affections? Let us love him with all the heart, though it is common for zeal and affection to be misunderstood and blamed; and remember that charity to the poor will not excuse any from particular acts of piety to the Lord Jesus. Christ commended this woman's pious attention to the notice of believers in all ages. Those who honour Christ he will honour. Covetousness was Judas' master lust, and that betrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; the devil suited his temptation to that, and so conquered him. And see what wicked contrivances many have in their sinful pursuits; but what appears to forward their plans, will prove curses in the end.</body></html>
