A hasty but lavish embalming of our Lord's sacred body had been begun on Friday evening by Joseph and Nicodemus. They had "brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>). This would be a compound - the gum of the myrrh tree, and a powder of the fragrant aloe wood mixed together, with which they would completely cover the body, which was then swathed with linen cloths (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>), also steeped in the aromatic preparation. Then the sindon would he placed over all. Compare the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, of St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-53.htm">Luke 23:53</a>), as applying to the <span class="accented">sindon</span>, with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of St. John (John 21:40) as applying to the <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. This verse records a further stage in the embalming. What had been done on the Friday evening had been done in haste, and yet sufficiently for the preservation of the sacred body, if that had been needful, from decay. The remaining work could be done more carefully and tenderly at the tomb. Observe the aorist in this verse (hJgo>rasan) "they bought;" not "they had bought." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-8 Nicodemus brought a large quantity of spices, but these good women did not think that enough. The respect others show to Christ, should not hinder us from showing our respect. And those who are carried by holy zeal, to seek Christ diligently, will find the difficulties in their way speedily vanish. When we put ourselves to trouble and expense, from love to Christ, we shall be accepted, though our endeavours are not successful. The sight of the angel might justly have encouraged them, but they were affrighted. Thus many times that which should be matter of comfort to us, through our own mistake, proves a terror to us. He was crucified, but he is glorified. He is risen, he is not here, not dead, but alive again; hereafter you will see him, but you may here see the place where he was laid. Thus seasonable comforts will be sent to those that lament after the Lord Jesus. Peter is particularly named, Tell Peter; it will be most welcome to him, for he is in sorrow for sin. A sight of Christ will be very welcome to a true penitent, and a true penitent is very welcome to a sight of Christ. The men ran with all the haste they could to the disciples; but disquieting fears often hinder us from doing that service to Christ and to the souls of men, which, if faith and the joy of faith were strong, we might do.</body></html>
