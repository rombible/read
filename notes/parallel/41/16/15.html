It would seem that this charge was delivered to them in Galilee, and that it is the same as that recorded in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), which was again repeated immediately before his ascension from Bethany. <span class="accented">Go ye into all the world</span>; not into Judaea only, but everywhere. This command has expanded with the discovery in later times of new portions of the inhabited earth; and must ever be coextensive with geographic discovery. <span class="accented">Preach the gospel to the whole creation</span>; that is, "among all nations." Man is the noblest work of God. All the creation is gathered up in him, created after the image of the Creator. <span class="accented">He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved</span>; <span class="accented">but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.</span> These words are very important. The first clause opposes the notion that faith alone is sufficient for salvation, without those works which are the fruit of faith. <span class="accented">He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved</span>; that is, he that believeth, and as an evidence of his faith accepts Christ's baptism, and fulfils the promises and vows which he then took upon himself, working out his own salvation with fear and trembling, shall be saved. <span class="accented">But he that disbelieveth shall be condemned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>,). The condemnation anticipates the doom which will be incurred by continual unbelief. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:14-18 The evidences of the truth of the gospel are so full, that those who receive it not, may justly be upbraided with their unbelief. Our blessed Lord renewed his choice of the eleven as his apostles, and commissioned them to go into all the world, to preach his gospel to every creature. Only he that is a true Christian shall be saved through Christ. Simon Magus professed to believe, and was baptized, yet he was declared to be in the bonds of iniquity: see his history in Ac 8:13-25. Doubtless this is a solemn declaration of that true faith which receives Christ in all his characters and offices, and for all the purposes of salvation, and which produces its right effect on the heart and life; not a mere assent, which is a dead faith, and cannot profit. The commission of Christ's ministers extends to every creature throughout the world, and the declarations of the gospel contain not only truths, encouragements, and precepts, but also most awful warnings. Observe what power the apostles should be endued with, for confirming the doctrine they were to preach. These were miracles to confirm the truth of the gospel, and means of spreading the gospel among nations that had not heard it.</body></html>
