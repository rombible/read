The history of the verses that follow is in every way remarkable. They are not found in two of the oldest MSS.--the Sinaitic and the Vatican--are marked as doubtful in many others, and are wanting in some versions. In some of these (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in the Vatican MS.) there is a blank space left between <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-8.htm" title="And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.">Mark 16:8</a> and the beginning of St. Luke, as though the writer had suspended his work and waited for materials. The absence was noticed by Jerome, who says that "nearly all the Greek texts omit them." Eusebius states the same fact as true of "the correct MSS.;" and no reference is made to them in the tables of parallel passages which were constructed for reference by Eusebius and Ammonius. On the other hand, they are referred to by Irenaeus (about A.D. 170), and are found in the Alexandrian and Cambridge MSS., and in twelve other uncials which are nearly (some say, quite) as old as the two which omit them. When we turn to the internal evidence we find that the narrative, which up to this point had followed closely in the footsteps of St. Matthew, now becomes a very condensed epitome of St. John's record of our Lord's appearance to Mary Magdalene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-11.htm" title="And when they had received it, they murmured against the manager of the house,">Matthew 20:11-18</a>), of St. Luke's account of the journey to Emmaus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-13.htm" title="And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.">Luke 24:13-35</a>), of the appearance to the ten disciples in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19-25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-36.htm" title="And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.">Luke 24:36-43</a>, of the mission of the eleven reported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/28-16.htm" title="Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.">Matthew 28:16-20</a>, of the Ascension as given by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-50.htm" title="And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.">Luke 24:50-53</a>. Two explanations of these facts are possible. (1) We may suppose that the writer of the Gospel wrote two copies of it, leaving one unfinished, ending at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-8.htm" title="And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.">Mark 16:8</a>; that this passed into the hands of persons by whom it was copied as complete, and so became the archetype of the MSS. in which the verses are wanting; while those that contain the subsequent verses were made from a more perfect text, written by St. Mark himself. (2) That the Gospel, having been originally completed by the writer, was in some way, by accident or design, mutilated; that as such it was reproduced faithfully by some transcribers, while others thought it better to give it a completion of some kind, by condensing what they found in the other Gospels. Of the two hypotheses the latter seems the more probable. It seems better, looking to these facts, to reserve notes, for the most part, for the Gospels in which the narratives appear in what was probably their original and certainly their fuller form.<p>(9-11) <span class= "bld">First to Mary Magdalene.</span>--See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/20-11.htm" title="But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,">John 20:11-18</a>, but note that St. Mark's account of her as one from whom Jesus "had cast out seven devils" is not from St. John, but from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm" title="And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,">Luke 8:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven devils</span>. St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>) mentions that "seven devils had gone out of her;" and St. Mark repeats it here, to show the power of love and penitence, that she was the first to be permitted to see the risen Savior. The vision of the angel had scared her, and she said nothing; but the actual sight of her risen Lord gave her confidence, and she went immediately, in obedience to his command, and told the disciples (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11-18</a>). She had lingered about his tomb; her strong affection riveted her to the spot. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:9-13 Better news cannot be brought to disciples in tears, than to tell them of Christ's resurrection. And we should study to comfort disciples that are mourners, by telling them whatever we have seen of Christ. It was a wise providence that the proofs of Christ's resurrection were given gradually, and admitted cautiously, that the assurance with which the apostles preached this doctrine afterwards might the more satisfy. Yet how slowly do we admit the consolations which the word of God holds forth!
