The verbal, or all but verbal, reproduction of these verses indicates the impression which they had made on the disciples. It may be noted, however, that St. Mark omits the "Woe unto the world because of offences . . .," which we find in St. Matthew, and that the emphatic thrice-repeated words, "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched," are found only in St. Mark. It should be noted, however, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm" title="And if your hand offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:">Mark 9:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-45.htm" title="And if your foot offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:">Mark 9:45</a> the words "into the fire that never shall be quenched" are omitted in some of the best MSS., and that the same MSS., and others, omit both <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-44.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-46.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:46</a>, leaving <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-48.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:48</a> to stand as the only description of Gehenna.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - This verse stands out as the severe antithesis to what has gone before.

Doubtless, remorse of conscience and keen self-reflection are this never-dying worm. Surely it is beyond compare better to undergo all possible pain, hardship, and self-denial here, and to be happy for ever hereafter, than to enjoy all kinds of worldly pleasure for a season, and to be miserable for ever. Like the sacrifices, we must be salted with salt; our corrupt affections must be subdued and mortified by the Holy Spirit. Those that have the salt of grace, must show they have a living principle of grace in their hearts, which works out corrupt dispositions in the soul that would offend God, or our own consciences.</body></html>
