The cloud enfolded them all, so that they could not be seen, it was so ample and dense, and yet so bright and shining. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>) says it was "a ought cloud. The cloud was a symbol of the grandeur and unapproachable glory of God. The disciples were admitted within this cloud that they might have a foretaste of future glory, and that they might be witnesses of what took place under the cloud, and especially that they might be able to give evidence throughout all ages of the voice which they heard come out of the cloud from "the excellent glory" (the expression is equivalent to the Hebrew "Shechinah," and St. Peter says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-18.htm">2 Peter 1:18</a>), it came from heaven), <span class="cmt_word">This is my beloved Son: hear ye him</span>. But at the same time that this cloud was the symbol, it was also the veil of Deity, of the glory of Deity. "He maketh the clouds his chariot," says the psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>). Moreover, the cloud abated and subdued the splendor of Christ's appearance, which otherwise the mortal eyes of the disciples could not have borne. It will be observed that St. Mark omits the words, found in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>)," in whom I am well pleased." So does St. Luke. But it is remarkable that they are found in St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>); from whence we might have expected to find them here. In St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-35.htm">Luke 9:35</a>) the most approved readings give, "This is my Son, my chosen (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)." The words, "my beloved Son," are impressed upon us in order that epithets so sweet and endearing might kindle our love and devotion. "Hear ye him" - not Moses, who has now departed, but Christ himself, the new Author of a new Law. "Hear ye him" was not said when our Lord was baptized, because he was then only just proclaimed to the world. But now these words signify the abolition of the old dispensation, and the establishment of the new covenant in Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 Here is a prediction of the near approach Christ's kingdom. A glimpse of that kingdom was given in the transfiguration of Christ. It is good to be away from the world, and alone with Christ: and how good to be with Christ glorified in heaven with all the saints! But when it is well with us, we are apt not to care for others, and in the fulness of our enjoyments, we forget the many wants of our brethren. God owns Jesus, and accepts him as his beloved Son, and is ready to accept us in him. Therefore we must own and accept him as our beloved Saviour, and must give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Christ does not leave the soul, when joys and comforts leave it. Jesus explained to the disciples the prophecy about Elias. This was very suitable to the ill usage of John Baptist.</body></html>
