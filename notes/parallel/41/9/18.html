This is doubtless the literal meaning. But there is much evidence to show that it means here "it striketh or throweth him down." This is the reudering of the Peshito Syriac, and of the Vulgate. The same interpretation is also given by Hesychius as one of the meanings of the word. St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-39.htm">Luke 9:39</a>) describes the symptoms thus: "A spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) that he foameth (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely." This it will be remembered is the record of one who was himself a physician. <span class="cmt_word">He grindeth his teeth, and pineth away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), as though the springs of his life were dried up. The father of the boy is here minutely describing the symptoms when the fit was upon him. He seems here to express the stiffness and rigidity of the body in the approaches of the malady. <span class="cmt_word">And I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able</span>. They had tried and failed. This failure is attributed by our Lord (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>) to their want of faith; or rather to their "little faith (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:14-29 The father of the suffering youth reflected on the want of power in the disciples; but Christ will have him reckon the disappointment to the want of faith. Very much is promised to our believing. If thou canst believe, it is possible that thy hard heart may be softened, thy spiritual diseases may be cured; and, weak as thou art, thou mayest be able to hold out to the end. Those that complain of unbelief, must look up to Christ for grace to help them against it, and his grace will be sufficient for them. Whom Christ cures, he cures effectually. But Satan is unwilling to be driven from those that have been long his slaves, and, when he cannot deceive or destroy the sinner, he will cause him all the terror that he can. The disciples must not think to do their work always with the same ease; some services call for more than ordinary pains.</body></html>
