We are not told what caused it. Was there some lingering radiance, or some expression of divine joy hardly less radiant, that struck the disciples and the people as strangely unlike the sadness that had been shown in recent words and looks? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/8-30.htm" title="And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.">Mark 8:30-33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The multitude were favourably towards Jesus, and were glad that returned at an opportune moment to defend his disciples against the scribes. But why were they <span class="cmt_word">greatly amazed</span>? The word in the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>. It seems most probable that they saw in his countenance, always heavenly and majestic, something even yet more Divine, retaining some traces of the glory of his transfiguration, even as the face of Moses shone when he came down from the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a>). It hardly seems likely that the amazement of the people was simply caused by our Lord having arrived at an opportune time to relieve his disciples of their difficulty. The Greek word expresses something more than would be satisfied by the fact of our Lord having come upon the scene just when he was wanted. Even if there were no remains of the transfiguration glory upon his countenance, the vivid recollection of the scene, of the conversation with Moses and Elijah, and the subject of it, and the voice of the Father, must have invested his countenance with a peculiar majesty and dignity. The same word, though without its compound (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), is used further on in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-32.htm">Mark 10:32</a> to express the amazement of the disciples, as he pressed eagerly onwards before them on his way to Jerusalem and to his cross. There was no doubt something then in his countenance which astonished them. The multitude running to him, saluted him. The scribes had not been able to shake their faith. In their view he was still "that Prophet that should come into the world." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:14-29 The father of the suffering youth reflected on the want of power in the disciples; but Christ will have him reckon the disappointment to the want of faith. Very much is promised to our believing. If thou canst believe, it is possible that thy hard heart may be softened, thy spiritual diseases may be cured; and, weak as thou art, thou mayest be able to hold out to the end. Those that complain of unbelief, must look up to Christ for grace to help them against it, and his grace will be sufficient for them. Whom Christ cures, he cures effectually. But Satan is unwilling to be driven from those that have been long his slaves, and, when he cannot deceive or destroy the sinner, he will cause him all the terror that he can. The disciples must not think to do their work always with the same ease; some services call for more than ordinary pains.</body></html>
