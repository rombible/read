As a divine name "the Most High God" belonged to the earliest stage of the patriarchal worship of the one Supreme Deity. Melchizedek appears as the priest of "the Most High God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18</a>). It is used by Balaam as the prophet of the wider Semitic monotheism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-16.htm" title="He has said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:">Numbers 24:16</a>), by Moses in the great psalm of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm" title="When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>. In the Prophets and the Psalms it mingles with the other names of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-14.htm" title="I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.">Isaiah 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-35.htm" title="To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,">Lamentations 3:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-17.htm" title="This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the basest of men.">Daniel 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-24.htm" title="This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come on my lord the king:">Daniel 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-32.htm" title="And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.">Daniel 4:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-34.htm" title="And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:">Daniel 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm" title="But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.">Daniel 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-22.htm" title="Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.">Daniel 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm" title="I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.">Psalm 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-2.htm" title="I will be glad and rejoice in you: I will sing praise to your name, O you most High.">Psalm 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-13.htm" title="The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.">Psalm 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm" title="There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.">Psalm 46:4</a>, and elsewhere). In many of these passages it will be seen that it was used where there was some point of contact in fact or feeling with nations which, though acknowledging one Supreme God, were not of the stock of Abraham. The old Hebrew word (<span class= "ital">Elion</span>) found a ready equivalent in the Greek <span class= "greekheb">???????</span> (<span class= "ital">hypsistos</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> which had already been used by Pindar as a divine name. That word accordingly appeared frequently in the Greek version of the Old Testament, and came into frequent use among Hellenistic or Greek-speaking Jews, occurring, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> not less than forty times in the book Ecclesiasticus. It was one of the words which, in later as in earlier times, helped to place the Gentile and the Jew on a common ground. As such, it seems, among other uses, to have been frequently used as a formula of exorcism; and this, perhaps, accounts for its being met with here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-28.htm" title="When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God most high? I beseech you, torment me not.">Luke 8:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-17.htm" title="The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show to us the way of salvation.">Acts 16:17</a>, as coming from the lips of demoniacs. It was the name of God which had most often been sounded in their ears.<p><span class= "bld">I adjure thee.</span>--The verb is that from which comes our word "exorcise." The phrase is peculiar to St. Mark, and confirms the notion that the demoniac repeated language which he had often heard. He, too, seeks in some sense to "exorcise," though it is in the language not of command, but entreaty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cried with a loud voice</span>; that is, the evil spirit cried out, using the organs of the man whom he possessed. <span class="cmt_word">What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God?</span> From hence it appears that, although at the great temptation of our Lord in the wilderness, Satan had but an imperfect knowledge of him: yet now, after the evidence of these great miracles, and more especially of his power over the evil spirits, there was a general belief amongst the hosts of evil that he was indeed the Son of God, the Messiah. I adjure thee by God, torment me not. The torment which he dreaded was that which he might suffer after expulsion. So St. Luke says that they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss. Great as this mystery of evil is, we may believe that the evil spirits, although while they roam about upon this earth they are in misery, still it is some alleviation that they are not yet shut up in the prison-house of hell, but are suffered to wander about and their depraved pleasure in tempting men; so that, if possible, they may at last drag them down with them into the abyss. For they are full of hatred of God and envy of man; and they find a miserable satisfaction in endeavoring to keep men out of those heavenly mansions from which, through pride, they are themselves now for ever excluded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-20 Some openly wilful sinners are like this madman. The commands of the law are as chains and fetters, to restrain sinners from their wicked courses; but they break those bands in sunder; and it is an evidence of the power of the devil in them. A legion of soldiers consisted of six thousand men, or more. What multitudes of fallen spirits there must be, and all enemies to God and man, when here was a legion in one poor wretched creature! Many there are that rise up against us. We are not a match for our spiritual enemies, in our own strength; but in the Lord, and in the power of his might, we shall be able to stand against them, though there are legions of them. When the vilest transgressor is delivered by the power of Jesus from the bondage of Satan, he will gladly sit at the feet of his Deliverer, and hear his word, who delivers the wretched slaves of Satan, and numbers them among his saints and servants. When the people found that their swine were lost, they had a dislike to Christ. Long-suffering and mercy may be seen, even in the corrections by which men lose their property while their lives are saved, and warning given them to seek the salvation of their souls. The man joyfully proclaimed what great things Jesus had done for him. All men marvelled, but few followed him. Many who cannot but wonder at the works of Christ, yet do not, as they ought, wonder after him.</body></html>
