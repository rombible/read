St. Mark's omission of the reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm" title="I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:">Psalm 78:2</a>, and his addition of "as they were able to hear it," are, each of them, characteristic. It may be noted that the "many such parables" of St. Mark imply something like the series which we find in St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33, 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With</span> <span class="cmt_word">many such parables;</span> such, that is, as he had just been delivering - plain and simple illustrations which all might understand; not abstruse and difficult similitudes, but sufficiently plain for them to perceive that there was heavenly and Divine truth lying hidden beneath them, so that they might be drawn onwards through that which they did understand, to search into something hidden beneath it, which at present they did not know. <span class="cmt_word">But privately to his own disciples he</span> <span class="cmt_word">expounded</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">all things</span>. This word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the Gospels. But it does occur in St. Peter's second Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a>), "No Scripture is of any private (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) exposition, or interpretation." This suggests a connection between St. Mark's Gospel and that Epistle, and may be accepted as an auxiliary evidence, however small, as to the genuineness of the Epistle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:21-34 These declarations were intended to call the attention of the disciples to the word of Christ. By his thus instructing them, they were made able to instruct others; as candles are lighted, not to be covered, but to be placed on a candlestick, that they may give light to a room. This parable of the good seed, shows the manner in which the kingdom of God makes progress in the world. Let but the word of Christ have the place it ought to have in a soul, and it will show itself in a good conversation. It grows gradually: first the blade; then the ear; after that the full corn in the ear. When it is sprung up, it will go forward. The work of grace in the soul is, at first, but the day of small things; yet it has mighty products even now, while it is in its growth; but what will there be when it is perfected in heaven!</body></html>
