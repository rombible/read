I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.">Mark 1:24</a>) now became more or less general. But it came in a form which our Lord could not receive. The wild cry of the frenzied demoniac had no place in the evidence to which He appealed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-31.htm" title="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.">John 5:31-37</a>), and tended, so far as it impressed men at all, to set them against the Teacher who was thus acknowledged.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying</span>.

It is just possible that this homage paid to our Lord may have been an act of cunning - a ruse, as it were, to lead the people to suppose that our Lord was in league with evil spirits. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Son of God</span>. Did, then, the unclean spirits really know that Jesus was the Son of God? A voice from heaven at his baptism had proclaimed him to be the Son of God, and that voice must have vibrated through the spiritual world. Then, further, they must have known him to be the Son of God by the numerous and mighty miracles which he wrought, and which they must have seen [o be real miracles, such as could only have been wrought by the supernatural power of God, and which were wrought by Christ for this very purpose, that they might prove him to be the promised Messiah, the only begotten Son of God. It may, however, be observed that they did not know this so clearly, but that, considering, on the other hand, the greatness of the mystery, they hesitated. It is probable that they were ignorant of the end and fruit of this great mystery, namely, that mankind were to be redeemed by the Incarnation, the Cross, and the Death of Christ; and so their own kingdom was to be overthrown, and the kingdom of God established. Blinded by their hatred of Jesus, whom they perceived to be a most holy Being, drawing multitudes to himself, they stirred up the passions of evil men against him, little dreaming that in promoting his destruction they were overthrowing their own kingdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-12 All our sicknesses and calamities spring from the anger of God against our sins. Their removal, or the making them blessings to us, was purchased to us by the blood of Christ. But the plagues and diseases of our souls, of our hearts, are chiefly to be dreaded; and He can heal them also by a word. May more and more press to Christ to be healed of these plagues, and to be delivered from the enemies of their souls.</body></html>
