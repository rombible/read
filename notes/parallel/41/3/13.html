What follows is, like the parallel narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12-13</a>, the selection rather than the mission of the Twelve, the latter appearing in Matthew 10. In St. Luke we find the noticeable fact that the night had been spent in prayer, apparently, as usual, alone, and that when it was day He called the company of the disciples, who had waited below, and made choice of the Twelve.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into a mountain</span>; literally, <span class="accented">into the mountain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Similarly, St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>) says," He went out into the mountain to pray." The use of the definite article might either point to some well-known eminence, or to the high table-land as distinguished from the plain, and in which there would be many recesses, which would explain the use of the preposition Tradition indicates Mount Hatten as the place, about five miles to the west of the Sea of Galilee. The summit rises above a level space, where large numbers might stand within hearing. It is supposed, with good reason, that it was from thence that the sermon on the mount was delivered. It was <span class="cmt_word">at</span> daybreak, as we learn from St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13</a>), after this night of prayer, that <span class="cmt_word">he called unto him whom he himself would</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">and they went</span> unto <span class="cmt_word">him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">they went away to him</span>, the word implying that they forsook their former pursuits. His own will was the motive power: he called "whom he himself would;" but their will consented. "When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will seek." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-21 Christ calls whom he will; for his grace is his own. He had called the apostles to separate themselves from the crowd, and they came unto him. He now gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. May the Lord send forth more and more of those who have been with him, and have learned of him to preach his gospel, to be instruments in his blessed work. Those whose hearts are enlarged in the work of God, can easily bear with what is inconvenient to themselves, and will rather lose a meal than an opportunity of doing good. Those who go on with zeal in the work of God, must expect hinderances, both from the hatred of enemies, and mistaken affections of friends, and need to guard against both.</body></html>
