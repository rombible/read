St. Mark omits the reference to the sheep fallen into a pit, and, on the other hand, gives more graphically our Lord's "looking round" with an "anger" which yet had in it a touch as of pitying grief. The form of the Greek participle implies compassion as well as sorrow. St. Mark alone names (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>) the Herodians as joining with the Pharisees in their plot for His destruction.

St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-9.htm">Matthew 12:9</a>) says, "their synagogue" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) This would probably be on the next sabbath after that named at the close of the last chapter. And there was a man there which had a withered hand (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>); literally<span class="accented">, which had his hand withered</span>, or <span class="accented">dried up. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And they watched him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">kept watching him.</span> There were probably scribes sent for this purpose from Jerusalem. St. Jerome informs us that in an apocryphal Gospel in use amongst the Nazarenes and Ebionites, the man whose hand was withered is described as a mason, and is said to have asked for help in the following terms: - "I was a mason, seeking my living by manual labour. I beseech thee, Jesus, to restore me the use of my hand, that I may not be compelled to beg my bread." This is so far consistent with St. Mark's description (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) as to show that the malady was the result of disease or accident, and not congenital. St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-6.htm">Luke 6:6</a>) informs us that it was the right hand. The disease probably extended through the whole arm according to the wider meaning of the Greek word It seems to have been a kind of atrophy, causing a gradual drying up of the limb; which in such a condition was beyond the reach of any mere human skill. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 This man's case was piteous; he had a withered hand, which disabled him from working for his living; and those that are so, are the most proper objects of charity. Let those be helped that cannot help themselves. But stubborn infidels, when they can say nothing against the truth, yet will not yield. We hear what is said amiss, and see what is done amiss; but Christ looks at the root of bitterness in the heart, the blindness and hardness of that, and is grieved. Let hard-hearted sinners tremble to think of the anger with which he will look upon them shortly, when the day of his wrath comes. The great healing day now is the sabbath, and the healing place the house of prayer; but the healing power is of Christ. The gospel command is like that recorded here: though our hands are withered, yet, if we will not stretch them out, it is our own fault that we are not healed. But if we are healed, Christ, his power and grace, must have all the glory.</body></html>
