And they said, Moses suffered to write</span> <span class="cmt_word">a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.</span> If we now turn to St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4, 5</a>). He we shall find that our Lord then appeals to the original institution of marriage. "Have ye not read, that he which made them from the beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh? So that they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder." He thus reminds them that marriage is a Divine institution; that as Adam and Eve were united by him in a union which was indissoluble, therefore he intended that the marriage bond should remain ever, so that the wife ought never to be separated from her husband, since she becomes by marriage a very part of her husband. To this purpose St. Augustine says ('City of God,' bk. 14:22). He "It was not of the spirit which commands and the body which obeys, nor of the rational soul which rules and the irrational desire which is ruled, nor of the contemplative virtue which is supreme, and the active which is subject, nor of the understanding of the mind and the sense of the body; but plainly of the matrimonial union, by which the sexes are mutually bound together, that our Lord, when asked whether it were lawful for any cause to put away one's wife, answered as in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4, 5</a>). It is certain, then, that from the first men were created as we see and know them to be now, of two sexes - male and female - and that they are called one, either on account of the matrimonial union, or on account of the origin of the woman, who was created from out of the side of the man." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-12 Wherever Jesus was, the people flocked after him in crowds, and he taught them. Preaching was Christ's constant practice. He here shows that the reason why Moses' law allowed divorce, was such that they ought not to use the permission; it was only for the hardness of their hearts. God himself joined man and wife together; he has fitted them to be comforts and helps for each other. The bond which God has tied, is not to be lightly untied. Let those who are for putting away their wives consider what would become of themselves, if God should deal with them in like manner.</body></html>
