There is, however, good reason for thinking, as they are wanting in the best MSS., that they were added by some one who sought to tone down the words of warning to what seemed a rational medium. Omitting the doubtful words, the sentence runs, "How hard is it to enter into the kingdom of God!"--hard alike for rich and poor, though, as the words that follow show, it was hardest for the former.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the disciples were astonished</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">were amazed <span class="cmt_word"></span>at his words</span>. The Greek word here implies wilderment. It is used again below at ver. 32. We find it also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>. This doctrine of our Lord was so new and strange to them. They had been accustomed to think little of the danger, and much of the advances of wealth. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them<span class="cmt_word">, Children how hard is it for them that trust in riches</span> <span class="cmt_word">enter into the kingdom of God!</span> He the enduring expression of "children" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). He and takes off somewhat of the edge of the seventy of the expression, by changing the form of it into the words," how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!" There is some authority for omitting the words. "for them that trot in riches;" so to reduce the sentence to the simple form, "How hard is it to enter into the kingdom of God!" Such is the reading in the two great uncial manuscripts, the Sinaitic and the Vatican. But on the whole the balance of evidence is in favor of that which was adopted in the Authorized Version, and has been retained by the Revisers of 1881; and it is reasonable to believe that our Lord qualified the former expression, in order to relieve the minds of his amazed disciples. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:23-31 Christ took this occasion to speak to his disciples about the difficulty of the salvation of those who have abundance of this world. Those who thus eagerly seek the wealth of the world, will never rightly prize Christ and his grace. Also, as to the greatness of the salvation of those who have but little of this world, and leave it for Christ. The greatest trial of a good man's constancy is, when love to Jesus calls him to give up love to friends and relatives. Even when gainers by Christ, let them still expect to suffer for him, till they reach heaven. Let us learn contentment in a low state, and to watch against the love of riches in a high one. Let us pray to be enabled to part with all, if required, in Christ's service, and to use all we are allowed to keep in his service.</body></html>
