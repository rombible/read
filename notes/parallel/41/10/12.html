All three cases are dealt with on the same grounds: (1) that the marriage relationship ought to be indissoluble, and that one cause only justifies or permits its dissolution; and (2) that any further permission of divorce is but a concession to the hardness of men's hearts for the avoidance of greater evils.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - This verse should be read thus: <span class="cmt_word">And if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. This reading is well supported. These words indicate that, according to our blessed Lord's teaching, wives and husbands have equal rights in reference to divorce; and so the Greek, according to the best authorities, is (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>) "shall marry," not (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>) "shall be married." Josephus, however, makes it evident that in his time husband and wife had by no means equal rights in these matters ('Antiq.' 15:7, 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-12 Wherever Jesus was, the people flocked after him in crowds, and he taught them. Preaching was Christ's constant practice. He here shows that the reason why Moses' law allowed divorce, was such that they ought not to use the permission; it was only for the hardness of their hearts. God himself joined man and wife together; he has fitted them to be comforts and helps for each other. The bond which God has tied, is not to be lightly untied. Let those who are for putting away their wives consider what would become of themselves, if God should deal with them in like manner.</body></html>
