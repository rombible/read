He while Salome is represented as the person who makes the request, the answer is given, not to her, but to her sons. <span class="cmt_word">Ye know not what ye ask</span>. Our Lord knew that the sons had spoken in the mother and by the mother. They knew not what they asked <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because his kingdom was spiritual and heavenly, not carnal and earthly, as they supposed; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because they sought the glory before they had gained the victory; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because perhaps they thought that this kingdom was given in right of natural relationship (they were his cousins); whereas it is not given save to those who deserve it and take it by force. <span class="cmt_word">Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism</span> <span class="cmt_word">that I am baptized with?</span> It is as though he said, "It is by my cross and passion that I am to attain to the kingdom; therefore the same way must be trodden by you who seek the same end." Our Lord here describes his passion as his cup. The "cup" everywhere in Holy Scripture, as well as in profane writers, signifies a man's portion, which is determined for him by God, and sent to him. The figure is derived from the ancient custom at feasts, by which the ruler of the feast tempered the wine according to his own will, and appointed to each guest his own portion, which it was his duty to drink. Our Lord then proceeds to describe his passion, which he had already spoken of as his cup, as his baptism. He uses this image because he would be totally buried, immersed, so to speak, in his passion. But it seems probable that the idea of <span class="accented">purification</span> entered into this image. It was a baptism of fire into which he was plunged, and out of which he came forth victorious. The fire of his bitter passion and death tried him. It was his "salting with fire." It pleased God thus to "make the Captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings." Our Lord asks these ambitious disciples whether they could drink his cup of suffering, and be baptized with his fiery baptism. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:32-45 Christ's going on with his undertaking for the salvation of mankind, was, is, and will be, the wonder of all his disciples. Worldly honour is a glittering thing, with which the eyes of Christ's own disciples have many times been dazzled. Our care must be, that we may have wisdom and grace to know how to suffer with him; and we may trust him to provide what the degrees of our glory shall be. Christ shows them that dominion was generally abused in the world. If Jesus would gratify all our desires, it would soon appear that we desire fame or authority, and are unwilling to taste of his cup, or to have his baptism; and should often be ruined by having our prayers answered. But he loves us, and will only give his people what is good for them.</body></html>
