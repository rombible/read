St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-18.htm">Luke 18:18</a>) that he was "a ruler." He had apparently been waiting for our Lord, waylaying him, though with a good intention. He showed zeal - as soon as he saw Jesus he ran to him; and he showed reverence, for he kneeled down to him. He wanted advice from one whom he must have heard of as a celebrated Teacher; and he wanted this counsel as a matter of great interest to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Good Master</span>. This would be the ordinary and courteous mode of accosting a person professing to be a teacher, so as to conciliate his attention and interest. <span class="cmt_word">What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</span> It is as though he said, "Rabbi, I know thee to be good, both as a man and as a teacher, and a prophet, well able to teach me perfectly those things which are really good, and which lead to blessedness hereafter. Tell me, therefore, What shall I do?" St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) says, "What good thing (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>) shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:17-22 This young ruler showed great earnestness. He asked what he should do now, that he might be happy for ever. Most ask for good to be had in this world; any good, Ps 4:6; he asks for good to be done in this world, in order to enjoy the greatest good in the other world. Christ encouraged this address by assisting his faith, and by directing his practice. But here is a sorrowful parting between Jesus and this young man. He asks Christ what he shall do more than he has done, to obtain eternal life; and Christ puts it to him, whether he has indeed that firm belief of, and that high value for eternal life which he seems to have. Is he willing to bear a present cross, in expectation of future crown? The young man was sorry he could not be a follower of Christ upon easier terms; that he could not lay hold on eternal life, and keep hold of his worldly possessions too. He went away grieved. See Mt 6:24, Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</body></html>
