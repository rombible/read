What follows, in both parts of the verse, is a general saying, modified by these introductory words. <span class= "ital">And one may almost say--according to the Law, all things are cleansed in blood, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</span> To the first rule an exception is found in the various purifications by water or by fire (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/31-22.htm" title="Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,">Numbers 31:22-24</a>); to the second in the remarkable law of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/5-11.htm" title="But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 5:11-13</a>. The expression "<span class= "ital">in</span> blood" is used because sprinkling with the blood of the slain victim was in figure a surrounding with, or inclusion within, the purifying element. On "cleansed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>) the best comment is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-19.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.">Leviticus 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-30.htm" title="For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.">Leviticus 16:30</a>; on "forgiveness," in the words which in Leviticus 4 are repeatedly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-20.htm" title="And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.">Leviticus 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-31.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell to the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-35.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:35</a>) used of the effect of the sin offering, "it shall be forgiven him." The second clause of the verse is founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.">Leviticus 17:11</a>. By "shedding of blood" we must probably understand the slaying of the animal, rather than the pouring out of the blood by the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-34.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:">Leviticus 4:34</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) With these words compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-20.htm" title="Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.">Luke 22:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And almost</span> (rather, <span class="accented">eve may almost say that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all things are according to the Law purified with blood; and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</span> The essentiality of blood, which is "the <span class="accented">life</span> of all flesh," for atonement and consequent remission, is emphatically asserted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, which expresses the principle of the whole sacrificial ritual. The idea seems to be that the life of man is forfeit to Divine justice (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>), and so blood, representing life, must be offered instead of his life for atonement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-22 The solemn transactions between God and man, are sometimes called a covenant, here a testament, which is a willing deed of a person, bestowing legacies on such persons as are described, and it only takes effect upon his death. Thus Christ died, not only to obtain the blessings of salvation for us, but to give power to the disposal of them. All, by sin, were become guilty before God, had forfeited every thing that is good; but God, willing to show the greatness of his mercy, proclaimed a covenant of grace. Nothing could be clean to a sinner, not even his religious duties; except as his guilt was done away by the death of a sacrifice, of value sufficient for that end, and unless he continually depended upon it. May we ascribe all real good works to the same all-procuring cause, and offer our spiritual sacrifices as sprinkled with Christ's blood, and so purified from their defilement.</body></html>
