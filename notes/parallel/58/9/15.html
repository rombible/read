"Christ through His own blood entered once for all into the Holy Place, having won eternal redemption; and by reason of this He is the Mediator of a covenant, a new covenant, in order that they who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance." For "the new testament" we must certainly read <span class= "ital">a new covenant:</span> whatever may be thought of the following group of verses, the rendering <span class= "ital">testament</span> has no place here. The leading thought of Hebrews 8 is the establishment of a new covenant, and the former covenant has been referred to three times in this very chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That by means of death.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">that, death having taken place for redemption from the transgressions, &c.</span> The first covenant had been broken by "transgressions:" unless there be redemption from these--that is, from the bondage of penalty which has resulted from these--there can be no promise and no new covenant. In respect of this bondage, this penalty, the death of Christ was a ransom--an offering to God looked at in the light of a payment in the place of debt, service, or penalty due. When debt and payment are changed into the corresponding ideas of sin and punishment, the <span class= "ital">ransom</span> gives place to the <span class= "ital">sin-offering, </span>of which the principle was the acknowledgment of death deserved, and the vicarious suffering of death. So far our thought has rested on the removal of the results of the past. The covenant and the promise relate to the establishment of the better future. Death was necessary alike for both. The offering of Christ's life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>) was a ransom or an offering for sin; it was also a sacrifice inaugurating a new covenant, which contained the promise of the eternal inheritance. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-16.htm" title="For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.">Hebrews 9:16-18</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13-14</a>, where the thought is very similar.<p><span class= "bld">They which are called.</span>--More clearly, <span class= "ital">they that have been called.</span> (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-6.htm" title="Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:">Romans 1:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2Thessalonians 2:13-14</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a> we have a similar expression, "partakers of a heavenly calling:" there also the idea of sonship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>), with its right of "inheritance," is certainly present.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And for this cause he is the Mediator of a new testament, that by means of death</span> (literally, <span class="accented">death having taken place</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</span> Here the view of the gospel as a new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> (introduced first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, and enlarged on in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>) is again brought in. For the word is still <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, though here, for reasons that will appear, rendered "testament" in the A.V. The connecting thought here is - It is <span class="accented">because</span> of Christ's sacrifice having been such as has been described, that he is the Mediator of that new and better covenant; it qualified him for being so. A sacrifice, a death, was required for giving it validity (vers. 16-23), and the <span class="accented">character</span> of his sacrifice implies a <span class="accented">better</span> covenant than the old, even such a one as Jeremiah foretold. Further, the purpose of his death is said to be "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant." For in the passage of Jeremiah the defect of the first covenant was based on the transgression of its conditions by man, while under the new one, such transgressions were to be no more remembered. But this could not be without atonement for them; the whole ceremonial of the Law signified this; and also that such atonement could not be except by death. The death of Christ satisfied this requirement; and so the new covenant could come in. So far the course of thought is clear. Nor is there difficulty in understanding the purport of ver. 18, etc., taken by itself, where the "blood-shedding" that inaugurated the first covenant is regarded as typical of that of Christ in the inauguration of the new one. But there is a difficulty about the intervening verses (16, 17), arising from the apparent use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> in a new sense, not otherwise suggested - that of <span class="accented">testament</span> rather than <span class="accented">covenant.</span> The verses are, as given in the A.V., <span class="cmt_word">For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. a word of which the exact meaning is not clear; some interpret "be brought in, or proved," some "be understood, implied ") <span class="cmt_word">the death of the testator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, equivalent to "him that made it"). <span class="cmt_word">For a testament is of force after men are dead</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth</span> (or, <span class="accented">for doth it ever avail while he theft made it liveth?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-26.htm">John 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-15.htm">Luke 3:15</a>). Now, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> itself undoubtedly may bear the sense of "testament." Its general meaning is " disposition," or "settlement;" and it may denote either compact between living persons, or a will to take effect after the testator's death. In the verses before us it <span class="accented">appears</span> to be used specifically in the latter sense. For they express general propositions, which are <span class="accented">not</span> true of all covenants, but <span class="accented">are</span> true (according to their most obvious sense) of all testaments. Further, this sense is distinctly applicable to the <span class="accented">new</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, regarded as the dying Christ's bequest to his Church. Hence, but for the context, we should naturally so understand it in these verses. The difficulties attending this sense are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word is not used in this specific sense before or afterwards in this Epistle or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>, which is the basis of the whole argument, or elsewhere, apparently, either in the Old Testament or the New. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sense does not suit the case of the <span class="accented">old</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, which was a covenant between the living God and his people; and there is no intimation of two senses being intended in the two cases: indeed, in the passage before us, the same sense seems to be distinctly implied, since the blood-shedding which inaugurated the old is at once (in ver. 17) spoken of as answering to the death which inaugurated the new, as though death inaugurated both in the same sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The word, in the sense of <span class="accented">covenant</span> (equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span>), is common in the LXX., expressing an idea familiar to Jews and Jewish Christians, while testamentary dispositions were, as far as we know, unfamiliar to the Hebrews; and, though the Roman testamentary law may have come into use when the Epistle was written, it is thought unlikely that the writer, addressing Hebrews, would have referred to it in illustration of a Divine dispensation, or, if he had, have used a word so well known to them in its traditional sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Christ is called (here as well as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a> and Hebrews 13:20) the <span class="accented">Mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) of the new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>: but a testament does not require a Mediator, nor, if it has one, can the same person be both mediator and testator. If, however, the sense of <span class="accented">testament</span> should seem inevitable here, we may explain as follows. Though the word has been used so far in a general sense, yet the writer, on the suggestion of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in ver. 15, passes in thought at ver. 16 to the specific sense of <span class="accented">testament</span>, as suiting the case of Christ, the language he uses being sufficient for carrying his readers with him in the transition. Further, though the old <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> was not in itself a testament, yet it was typical of that which was; its whole ceremonial foreshadowed the future Testator's death, and so, in a typical sense, it might also itself be called one. Consequently, in ver. 18, the inaugurating sacrifices of the old dispensation are regarded as representing the death of the testator; for they prefigured Christ, through whose death the "eternal inheritance" is bequeathed to man. (In accordance with this view, the Vulgate renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="accented">testamentum</span> throughout the Epistle, even when the old dispensation is referred to.) As to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (translated "the testator"), it <span class="accented">is</span>, according to this view, ultimately God the Father in the new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, as well as in the old, though, of course, the Godhead could not die. But the Father having placed the whole inheritance destined for mankind in the hands of Christ as Mediator, in <span class="accented">his</span> human death the testator died. And thus one of the difficulties above mentioned may be met, viz. that of Christ being regarded both as Testator and Mediator. Christ <span class="accented">was</span>, in fact, both - Testator, in that, being one with God, he bequeathed through his death the kingdom appointed unto hint by the Father; Mediator, in that it was through his incarnation only that the "eternal inheritance" willed to us by the Father could be transmitted in the way of testament. So in effect Chrysostom explains. Apposite to this view of the subject are his own words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-29.htm">Luke 22:29</a>), "And I appoint (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) unto you a kingdom, as my Father appointed (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) unto me." Here we have the same verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) as is used in the Epistle. And though, in the passage from St. Luke, the idea of a <span class="accented">testamentary</span> appointment is not necessarily implied, yet it is naturally suggested where Christ is speaking on the eve of, and with reference to, his death. There is, however, another view taken (decidedly by Whitby, Ebrard, and in the recent 'Speaker's Commentary'), according to which the idea of a <span class="accented">testament</span> does not come in at all, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> retaining here, as elsewhere, its usual sense of <span class="accented">covenant.</span> The position is that, though the propositions of vers. 16, 17 are <span class="accented">not</span> true of all covenants, yet there is a sense in which they <span class="accented">are</span> true of any covenant between God and man; which is the only kind of covenant that the writer has in view, or that his readers would be led to think of by the previous reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>, or by the associations of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> as used in the Old Testament. The sense in which the propositions are true of such a covenant is thus expressed by Ebrard: "Whenever sinful man will enter into a covenant with the holy God, the man must first die - must first atone for his guilt by death (or must put in a substitute for himself)." This principle is expressed (it is alleged), not only by the sacrifices that inaugurated this covenant of the Law, but also wherever a covenant between God and man is spoken of in the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the covenant with Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-8.htm">Genesis 15:8</a>, etc., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>.). In the case of covenants between man and man (as between Abraham and Abimelech, and between Jacob and Laban) there was no need of slain victims, whoso life had to be given for that of one of the contracting parties; but there is always expressed such need in the case of a covenant between God and man. Further, the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, is, according to this view, illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a>, where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui ordinant testamentum ejus super sacrificiis</span>). The same preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is used in both passages, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is supposed to express the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. This passage from the psalm is certainly much to the point in support of the view before us, serving moreover to meet in some degree one principal objection to it, viz. that it requires <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to be understood of the human party to the covenant, and not of its Divine Author. Such is not the most obvious application of the word, nor the one sanctioned by the quotation from Jeremiah, or by other references to the Divine covenant (see <span class="accented">supra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-29.htm">Luke 12:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a>; as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>, quoted below (ver. 20), where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, is the word in the LXX. But such is the application in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a>, and may be considered, therefore, not untenable. The writer may, indeed, have had the expression in the psalm in his mind when he wrote the verses before us. It appears from what has been said that difficulties attend both the views that have been above explained. It is not here attempted to decide between them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-22 The solemn transactions between God and man, are sometimes called a covenant, here a testament, which is a willing deed of a person, bestowing legacies on such persons as are described, and it only takes effect upon his death. Thus Christ died, not only to obtain the blessings of salvation for us, but to give power to the disposal of them. All, by sin, were become guilty before God, had forfeited every thing that is good; but God, willing to show the greatness of his mercy, proclaimed a covenant of grace. Nothing could be clean to a sinner, not even his religious duties; except as his guilt was done away by the death of a sacrifice, of value sufficient for that end, and unless he continually depended upon it. May we ascribe all real good works to the same all-procuring cause, and offer our spiritual sacrifices as sprinkled with Christ's blood, and so purified from their defilement.</body></html>
