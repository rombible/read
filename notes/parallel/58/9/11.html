In that we read of the first covenant as possessing ordinances of service and its holy place--both, however, "of this world," and the following verses describe the sanctuary itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1-5</a>) and the ordinances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6-10</a>). Now, the Mediator of the New Covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>), "Christ," whose name brings with it the thought of the satisfaction of all hope and fulfilment of all promises, has appeared as High Priest; and entering into the true Holy of Holies has accomplished once for all what the earlier ministrations typified. This is the main thought; but in few verses do the single words require more careful study. The various-reading mentioned above, "the good things that are come," is very interesting. It is not supported by a large number of authorities, but amongst them are the Vatican MS. (whose guidance, it may be remarked, we shall soon lose, as the ancient text breaks off suddenly in the middle of a word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>), the Claromontane MS., and two Syriac versions. One strong argument in its favour presents itself on a comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a> (where there is no doubt about the reading), "the good things to come." A scribe who had in mind those words, confirmed by the repeated occurrence of a similar thought in different parts of the Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm" title="For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.">Hebrews 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-5.htm" title="And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,">Hebrews 6:5</a>), might easily substitute them for words expressing a less familiar thought. The two phrases differ more in form than in reality. In one we look at the new order of things, which is never to pass away, as already introduced by Christ (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>); and in the other the same new order is thought of as future to those who waited through long ages for "the Christ," and in its consummation still future to ourselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-5.htm" title="And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,">Hebrews 6:5</a>). The form of expression reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>, where Jesus is called the High Priest of our confession (compare also <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a>, "the Messenger of the covenant"): He is associated with "the good things" as having brought them in, as Mediator of the covenant to which they belong.<p>Through (or, <span class= "ital">by means of</span>) the more perfect Tabernacle, through (or, <span class= "ital">by means of</span>) His own blood, Christ entered into the Holy Place. The two-fold reference to the type is very plain. It was by passing through "the first Tabernacle" that the high priest reached the Holiest Place; it was by means of the blood of the sin-offering that he was enabled to enter into that place of God's presence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm" title="But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:">Hebrews 9:7</a>). But what in the antitype answers to this Tabernacle? The expression of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>, perhaps, first presents itself to the mind: if, however, we were right in understanding the words "that has passed through the heavens" as descriptive of our Lord's ascension far above all heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm" title="He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)">Ephesians 4:10</a>), it seems evident that this verse is no real parallel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm" title="By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;">Hebrews 10:20</a> the thought is somewhat different, but yet sufficiently akin to be suggestive in regard to these words. There the veil is spoken of as symbolising "the flesh" of our Lord. Here we have in all probability an extension of the same thought, "the more perfect Tabernacle" being the human nature of our Lord. We think at once of a number of passages presenting the same idea: "The Word was made flesh and made His tabernacle among us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>); "He spake of the temple of His body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>); "The Father that dwelleth in Me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a>); "In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>). As in Him God gave to the world the first true revelation of Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>), God's dwelling-place amongst His people was a type of the Incarnate Word. The symbolism of the present verse compels us to think of the first and second Tabernacles as separate. It was otherwise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>, a verse which can only receive its proper explanation when the words now before us are considered. There the reference is to the High Priest who has already entered the Holiest Place and has "sat down at the right hand" of God. The distinction of outer and inner sanctuary has disappeared; and, carrying out more fully the thought of the passages quoted above, we may say that, as "the sanctuary" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a> symbolises the place of God's immediate presence, "the true Tabernacle" represents the place of His continued and unceasing revelation of Himself to man, "in Christ." There is no difficulty now in explaining the epithets, "greater," "more perfect," "not of this creation." By means of this assumption of human nature He received power to become High Priest, power also to become Himself the sin-offering. Once before only in the Epistle have we read of this two-fold relation of our Lord to the sacrificial act. There it is mentioned parenthetically (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>) and by anticipation, here it is the leading thought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The efficacy of this offering is taken up again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>; the entering into the Holiest Place, in the latter part of the chapter. A new thought is introduced in the last words of this verse, "having won eternal <span class= "ital">redemption.</span>" Through the sacrifice atonement has been made and sin expiated: the blessing won, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9</a> is called eternal salvation (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>), is here "eternal redemption." The latter figure enlarges the former by the additional thought of the payment of a price. The deliverance of man from God's wrath and the penalty of sin, which Jesus effected by means of the offering of Himself, is the "eternal redemption which He won" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The words, "for us," are not in the text: they are too intimately present in the whole thought to need direct expression.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Christ having come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51</a>) <span class="cmt_word">a High Priest</span> (or, <span class="accented">as High Priest</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">into the holy place, having obtained</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not necessarily antecedent to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">eternal redemption.</span> On the futurity expressed (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>) by "the good things <span class="accented">to come"</span> (the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> being preferred to <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), see under Hebrews 1:1 (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Here, certainly, the period of the earthly tabernacle having been the temporal standpoint in all the preceding verses, futurity with regard to it may, without difficulty, be understood; and hence "the good things" may still be regarded as such as have already come in Christ. On the other hand, there is no difficulty in regarding them as still future. For the full and final result of even Christ's perfected high priesthood is not yet come. But what is "the greater and more perfect tabernacle," through which he entered the heavenly holy of holies? It seems evidently, in the first place, to be connected with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, being regarded as the antitype of that "<span class="accented">first</span> tabernacle" through which the high priests on earth had passed in order to enter within the veil; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> having here a local, not an instrumental, sense. The instrumental sense of the same preposition in the next clause (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not against this view. In English, "through his own blood he entered <span class="accented">through</span> the tabernacle" presents no difficulty, though "through" is used in two different senses. But what is exactly meant by the tabernacle through which Christ has passed? Bearing in mind what was said under Hebrews 8:2 of the prophetic visions of a heavenly temple - corresponding to the earthly one - and that the epithet <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is applied also (ver. 24) by implication to the counterpart of the holy of holies, and also the expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>), "having passed through the heavens (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>)," we may regard it as denoting the heavenly region beyond this visible sphere of things (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#xa0;&#x1fbf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), intervening between the latter and the immediate presence, or "face," of God. Thus "through the greater and more perfect tabernacle" of this verse answers to "having passed through the heavens" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>; and "entered once for all into the holy place" of ver. 12 to "entered into heaven itself" (the very heaven) of ver. 24. Thus also the symbolical acts of the Day of Atonement are successively, and in due order, fulfilled. As the high priest first sacrificed the sin offering <span class="accented">outside</span> the tabernacle, and then passed through the holy to the holy of holies, so Christ first offered himself in this mundane sphere of things, and then passed through the heavens to the heaven of heavens. Delitzsch, taking this view, offers a still more definite explanation; thus: "The former (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is that eternal heaven of God himself (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) which is his own self-manifested eternal glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>), and existed before all worlds; the latter (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) is the heaven of the blessed, in which he shines upon his creatures in 'the light of love' - 'the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven' of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-5.htm">Revelation 15:5</a>, which the apocalyptic seer beheld filled with incense-smoke from 'the glory of God, and from his power.'" There are other views of what is meant by "the greater and more perfect tabernacle." The most notable, as being that of Chrysostom and the Fathers generally, is that it means Christ's human nature, which he assumed before passing to the throne of the Majesty on high. This view is suggested by his having himself spoken of the <span class="accented">temple</span> of his body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-21.htm">John 2:21</a>), and calling it, if the "false witnesses" at his trial reported him truly, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a>); by the expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), "The Word was made flesh, and <span class="accented">tabernacled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) among us;" by St. Paul's speaking of the human body as a <span class="accented">tabernacle</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1, 4</a>); and by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 20</a>, where the "veil" through which we have "a new and living way into the holy place through the blood of Jesus" is said to be his <span class="accented">flesh.</span> There is thus abundant ground for thinking of Christ's body as signified by a tabernacle; and the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 20</a> goes some way to countenance such an interpretation here. The objection to it is that it seems neither suggested by the context nor conformable to the type of the high priest on the Day of Atonement. For, if the human body of Christ assumed at his birth is meant, he entered into that before, not after, his atoning sacrifice; and if, with Hofmann, we think rather of his glorified body, in what sense in accordance with the type can it be said that he entered <span class="accented">through</span> it? We should rather say that he ascended <span class="accented">with</span> it to the right hand of God. The further points of contrast between Christ's entrance and that of the earthly high priests are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The instrumental medium was not the blood of goats and calves (specified here as having been the sin offerings on the Day of Atonement), but <span class="accented">his own</span> blood; he was both Priest and Victim. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> He entered, not yearly, but <span class="accented">once for all</span>; there was no need of continual repetition. And the conclusion is drawn flint the redemption he thus wrought is consequently <span class="accented">complete</span> and <span class="accented">eternal.</span> The first of these contrasts is enlarged on from ver. 13 to ver. 24; the second (denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) is taken up at ver. 25. On the word "redemption" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: in some other passages <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) it is to be observed that it means, according to its etymology, release obtained by payment of a <span class="accented">ransom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and thus in itself involves the doctrine of <span class="accented">atonement</span> according to the orthodox view. It is true that in many Scripture passages it is used (as also <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x1fef;</span>) in a more general sense to express deliverance only, but never where the redemption of mankind by Christ is spoken cf. In such cases the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is often distinctly specified, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>, "his life;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>, "himself;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, "his blood;" cf. also <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 14. As to how the availing power of the atonement is to be understood, more will be said under the verses that follow. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-14 All good things past, present, and to come, were and are founded upon the priestly office of Christ, and come to us from thence. Our High Priest entered into heaven once for all, and has obtained eternal redemption. The Holy Ghost further signified and showed that the Old Testament sacrifices only freed the outward man from ceremonial uncleanness, and fitted him for some outward privileges. What gave such power to the blood of Christ? It was Christ's offering himself without any sinful stain in his nature or life. This cleanses the most guilty conscience from dead, or deadly, works to serve the living God; from sinful works, such as pollute the soul, as dead bodies did the persons of the Jews who touched them; while the grace that seals pardon, new-creates the polluted soul. Nothing more destroys the faith of the gospel, than by any means to weaken the direct power of the blood of Christ. The depth of the mystery of the sacrifice of Christ, we cannot dive into, the height we cannot comprehend. We cannot search out the greatness of it, or the wisdom, the love, the grace that is in it. But in considering the sacrifice of Christ, faith finds life, food, and refreshment.</body></html>
