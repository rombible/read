Man does not return to die a second time. That some few have twice passed through death does not affect the general law. The emphatic word "once" and the special design of the verse are explained by the words which follow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this judgment: so the Christ also, once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, without sin, to them that look for him, unto salvation.</span> The Divine ordinance concerning mankind in general has its analogy in the truth concerning Christ, who was made like unto us in all things, and who represents humanity. As human life, with all its works, comes to an end in death, and only judgment fellows, so Christ's death once for all completed his ministerial work, and nothing remains for him to do but to return as Judge in glory - he <span class="accented">judicaturus</span>, men <span class="accented">judicandi.</span> "To bear the sins of many" is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. For similar use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>, LXX.; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which expresses the idea of Christ's taking our sins upon himself and bearing them up to the cross, and so removing them. The ideas of <span class="accented">bearing</span> and of <span class="accented">taking away</span> may thus be both implied. In contrast with this is the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("without, or apart from, sin") when he shall appear again. For then he will have been, as he is now, removed from it altogether - from its burden and its surroundings; it is in glory only that he will then appear. And so also "to them that look for him" his appearing will be "unto salvation" only. They, too, will have done with sin. The insertion of the words, "to them that look for him," precludes the conclusion that it will be so to all. The many passages that express the doom of those who shall be set on the left hand, whatever they imply, retain their awful meaning (cf. especially <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-28 It is evident that the sacrifices of Christ are infinitely better than those of the law, which could neither procure pardon for sin, nor impart power against it. Sin would still have been upon us, and have had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyed the works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, and happy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep one of the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises or neglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemer liveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience of the church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayer as the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.</body></html>
