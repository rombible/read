By most readers of the Authorised version, probably, these words are understood as referring to the Holy Spirit, whose influence continually rested on "the Anointed One of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>). For this opinion there seems to be no foundation in the usage of the New Testament, and it is not indicated by anything in the context. The explanation of the words must rather be sought in the nature of our Lord, or in some attribute of that nature. There are a few passages, mainly in the Epistles of St. Paul, in which language somewhat similar is employed in regard to the spirit (<span class= "ital">pneuma</span>) of our Lord. The most remarkable of these are <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>, where "spirit of holiness" is placed in contrast with "flesh;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, "in spirit." On the latter Bishop Ellicott writes: "<span class= "ital">in spirit</span>, in the higher sphere of His divine life: the <span class= "ital">pneuma</span> of Christ is not here the Holy Spirit, but <span class= "ital">the higher principle of</span> spiritual life, which was not the Divinity (this would be an Apollinarian assertion), but especially and intimately united with it." (Another passage of great interest is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>.) The attribute "eternal" is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.">Hebrews 7:18-19</a>, "according to power of indissoluble life (He hath become priest), for of Him it is testified, Thou art a priest for ever." Through this spirit, a spirit of holiness, a spirit of indissoluble life, He offered Himself to God. This made such a self-offering possible; this gave to the offering infinite worth. In the words which stand in contrast with these (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a>) we read of the death of animals which had no power over their own transient life: He who was typified in every high priest and in every victim, "through an eternal spirit," of Himself laid down His life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>), offering Himself to God in the moment and article of death,--offered Himself in His constant presence in the Holiest Place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Without spot.</span>--The word here used is frequently applied in the LXX. to the victims "without blemish" that were offered in sacrifice. The sinlessness of Jesus is expressed under the same metaphor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve a Living God.</span> The word "cleanse" is akin to "cleanness" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a>. Authorities are divided between "our" and "your"; but the former is probably the better reading. Once before, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>, the writer has spoken of "dead works." (See the Note.) It is here, however, that the significance most fully appears; for we cannot doubt that there exists a reference to the purification made necessary by all contact with death. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a>.) Since the works are dead because they had no share in true life, which is the life of God, the last words bring before us the thought of a Living God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a>). This thought also stands connected with "<span class= "ital">eternal</span> Spirit," for those who are cleansed through the offering of Christ shall share His relation to the Living God. The contrast is in every respect complete. From the whole number of Jewish rites had been selected (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a>) the two which most fully represented the purification from sin and from pollution through death, in order that this completeness of antithesis might be attained. It is not necessary to trace the details of the contrast. In each and in all we read the "How much more!"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purify your</span> (al. <span class="accented">our</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</span> As in vers. 11, 12 Christ's entrance was contrasted with that of the high priest, so here is the sacrifice itself, in virtue of which he entered, similarly contrasted. The points of contrast to which attention is drawn are these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was the blood, not of beasts that perish, but of Christ himself - <span class="accented">the</span> Christ, the Hope of Israel, whose Divine prerogatives have been set forth in the preceding chapters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> He offered <span class="accented">himself.</span> His offering was a voluntary self-oblation, not the blood-shedding of passive victims. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> His offering was realty "spotless" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in the sense of <span class="accented">sinless</span> - the only sense that can satisfy Divine justice - symbolized only by the absence of material blemish in the ancient sacrifices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> And this he did "through the eternal Spirit." This expression, which comes first in order, has an important bearing on the meaning of the whole passage, and calls for especial consideration. Be it observed, first, that the words are "the eternal Spirit," not "the Holy Spirit." It is not the usual designation of the Third Person of the Holy Trinity. (The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> has not much authority in its favor, and is, besides, much more likely to have been substituted than the other.) What, then, is meant by "the eternal Spirit," through which Christ offered himself spotless? There are three notable texts in which the <span class="accented">Spirit</span> in Christ is opposed to the <span class="accented">flesh</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f76;&#x3b4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. In all these passages the <span class="accented">Spirit is</span> that Divine element of life in Christ, distinct from the human nature which he assumed of the seed of David, in virtue of which he rose from the dead. In us men, too, according to St. Paul, there is the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> (sometimes <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> alone are spoken of) - the higher principle of life within us, in virtue of which we can have communion with God and be influenced by his Holy Spirit. Any act of acceptable sell oblation that we might be capable of would be done through the <span class="accented">spirit</span> that is in us, to which the <span class="accented">flesh</span> is subdued. Corresponding to this in Christ was "the <span class="accented">eternal</span> Spirit" - a truly Divine spiritual Personality, conjoined with his assumed humanity. Through this he overcame death, it being impossible that he should be holden of it; through this, too he offered himself a willing sacrifice, submitting to the full penalty of human sin in obedience to the Father's will. Thus is prominently brought to view the <span class="accented">spiritual</span> aspect of the atonement. Its especial virtue is said to lie, not in the mere suffering or the mere physical blood-shedding and death upon the cross, but in its being a voluntary act of perfect obedience on the part of him who was the Representative of man, and in whom "<span class="accented">the</span> eternal Spirit" triumphed over the weakness of humanity. The agony in the garden (see under ver. 7, etc.) is illustrative of this view of the virtue of the atonement. There we perceive "the eternal Spirit" in the Savior completely victorious over natural human shrinking. The same view appears in the reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40.htm">Psalm 40</a> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>, where "<span class="accented">Lo</span>, I come to do thy will, O God" expresses the essential principle of the availing sacrifice (see below on Hebrews 10:5, etc.). Hence follows what is said next of the <span class="accented">effect</span> of such a sacrifice as this was - to purify, not the <span class="accented">flesh</span>, but the <span class="accented">conscience</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), meaning "man's inner consciousness" with regard to God and our relations to him. It belonged essentially to the spiritual sphere of things, and in that sphere (as was not the case with the old sacrifices) must be, and is felt to be, its availing power. It <span class="accented">was</span>, in fact, just such a sacrifice as man's conscience, if enlightened, feels to be due to God. Man, as he is now, cannot make it; but in the "Son of man" he sees it made, and thus finds at last the idea of a true atonement fulfilled. In the expression, "dead works," there may be an intended allusion to the dead <span class="accented">bodies</span> from the pollution of which especially the "ashes of an heifer" purified; and in "to serve" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) there is an evident reference to the legal type. As the legal sin offering purified the <span class="accented">flesh</span> from the contamination of contact with the dead, so that the Israelites, thus cleansed, might offer acceptable worship, so Christ's offering of himself fulfils what was thus typified; it purifies the "conscience" from the contamination of "dead works," so that we may offer our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is our <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). On <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, see under Hebrews 6:1. Here, the idea of general pollution pervading the whole congregation having been prominent in what precedes, we may, perhaps, take the expression as denoting all human works whatever "done before the grace of Christ and the inspiration of his Spirit," all being regarded as tainted with sin, and so <span class="accented">dead</span> for the purpose of justification. The purification from them which is spoken of involves (be it further observed) both justification through atonement and sanctification through grace: the first, since, otherwise, the very meaning of the old sin offerings would not be fulfilled; the second, as denoted by the concluding clause, "to serve," etc. The second is the necessary sequence of the first. Believers are not only "cleansed from their former sins," but also put into a position for offering an acceptable service. In the <span class="accented">life</span> of Christ in whom they live, and who ever <span class="accented">liveth</span> to make intercession for them, they can henceforth "serve the <span class="accented">living</span> God." There is involved, in fact (to return to the account of the new covenant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>.), both oblivion of past sins and a writing of the Law upon the heart. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-14 All good things past, present, and to come, were and are founded upon the priestly office of Christ, and come to us from thence. Our High Priest entered into heaven once for all, and has obtained eternal redemption. The Holy Ghost further signified and showed that the Old Testament sacrifices only freed the outward man from ceremonial uncleanness, and fitted him for some outward privileges. What gave such power to the blood of Christ? It was Christ's offering himself without any sinful stain in his nature or life. This cleanses the most guilty conscience from dead, or deadly, works to serve the living God; from sinful works, such as pollute the soul, as dead bodies did the persons of the Jews who touched them; while the grace that seals pardon, new-creates the polluted soul. Nothing more destroys the faith of the gospel, than by any means to weaken the direct power of the blood of Christ. The depth of the mystery of the sacrifice of Christ, we cannot dive into, the height we cannot comprehend. We cannot search out the greatness of it, or the wisdom, the love, the grace that is in it. But in considering the sacrifice of Christ, faith finds life, food, and refreshment.</body></html>
