The mention of the "more excellent ministry" led to the description of the new covenant with which it is united (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6-13</a>). This verse, then, attaches itself to the fifth and sixth verses of Hebrews 8 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5-6</a>): "Even the first (covenant), then, had ordinances of divine service and its sanctuary, of this world." The "service" is spoken of again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>; the "ordinances" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a>, where they are called "carnal." Very similar is the language here, for the words so emphatically standing at the close of the verse are probably descriptive not of the "sanctuary" only, but also of the "ordinances." Both place and ministrations belonged to <span class= "ital">this world, </span>and thus stand in contrast with "the heavenly things," of which the Tabernacle was a token and shadow. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>.) The ordinary Greek text (here following the first printed Greek Testament) has "the first Tabernacle," and this reading was followed by Tyndale and Coverdale. All ancient MSS. omit the word; and, as in a long succession of verses "covenant" has been the leading thought, the rendering of the Authorised version is certainly correct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then verily</span> (or, <span class="accented">now indeed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the first covenant also</span> (or, <span class="accented">even the first covenant</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>had ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary</span> (rather <span class="accented">its sanctuary of this world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). The definite article points to the well-known one of the Mosaic dispensation, which, unlike the true one, was in its bearings, as well as locally and materially, of this world only). This sanctuary itself is now first described in necessary preparation for an account of priestly ministrations in it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 The apostle shows to the Hebrews the typical reference of their ceremonies to Christ. The tabernacle was a movable temple, shadowing forth the unsettled state of the church upon earth, and the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily. The typical meaning of these things has been shown in former remarks, and the ordinances and articles of the Mosaic covenant point out Christ as our Light, and as the Bread of life to our souls; and remind us of his Divine Person, his holy priesthood, perfect righteousness, and all-prevailing intercession. Thus was the Lord Jesus Christ, all and in all, from the beginning. And as interpreted by the gospel, these things are a glorious representation of the wisdom of God, and confirm faith in Him who was prefigured by them.</body></html>
