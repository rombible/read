On the, "washings" see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>. The preceding words would most naturally refer to meats, &c., of which men were <span class= "ital">required to partake</span> (as Exodus 12; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm" title="And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.">Leviticus 7:15</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> but no doubt include the various restrictions and distinctions of the ceremonial law (Leviticus 11; Numbers 6, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> All these are "ordinances of flesh," ordinances which relate to the outward state of things only; closely connected with the maintenance of external privileges and relations, but (in themselves) nothing more. "Imposed," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm" title="Now therefore why tempt you God, to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?">Acts 15:10</a> : "reformation," <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-7.htm" title="For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.">Hebrews 8:7-12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Rendered in A.V.," <span class="accented">Which stood</span> only in (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>) meats and drinks and divers washings, and carnal ordinances [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, Textus Receptus], imposed on <span class="accented">them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) until the time of reformation." This is a satisfactory rendering of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> before "meats," etc., being taken in the sense of <span class="accented">dependence</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> necessarily as agreeing with "gifts and sacrifices" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in ver. 9. But there are other readings, though none, any more than that of the Textus Receptus, to be decidedly preferred on the mere ground of manuscript authority. The best sense seems to be given by that of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3a9;&#x1ffd;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, so that we may render (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> being taken in the sense of <span class="accented">addition</span>), Being only (<span class="cmt_word">with meats and drinks and divers washings</span>) <span class="cmt_word">carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation.</span> We thus have an obvious neuter plural (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> to agree with, and we avoid the assertion that the "gifts and sacrifices" of the Law "stood only" in "meats," etc. This was not so; their essential part was blood-shedding (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> ver. 22) the other things here mentioned were but accompaniments and appendages. The "meats and drinks" spoken of may refer mainly to the distinctions between clean and unclean viands, which we know were made such a point of by the Jews of the apostolic ago (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-15.htm">Mark 7:15</a>). The "diverse washings" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) may be taken to include both the ablutions of the priests before sacrifice, and those enjoined on the people in many parts of the Law after ceremonial defile-merit, which kind of washings had been further multiplied variously in the traditional law (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3, 4, 8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-10 The apostle goes on to speak of the Old Testament services. Christ, having undertaken to be our High Priest, could not enter into heaven till he had shed his blood for us; and none of us can enter, either into God's gracious presence here, or his glorious presence hereafter, but by the blood of Jesus. Sins are errors, great errors, both in judgment and practice; and who can understand all his errors? They leave guilt upon the conscience, not to be washed away but by the blood of Christ. We must plead this blood on earth, while he is pleading it for us in heaven. A few believers, under the Divine teaching, saw something of the way of access to God, of communion with him, and of admission into heaven through the promised Redeemer, but the Israelites in general looked no further than the outward forms. These could not take away the defilement or dominion of sin. They could neither discharge the debts, nor resolve the doubts, of him who did the service. Gospel times are, and should be, times of reformation, of clearer light as to all things needful to be known, and of greater love, causing us to bear ill-will to none, but good-will to all. We have greater freedom, both of spirit and speech, in the gospel, and greater obligations to a more holy living.</body></html>
