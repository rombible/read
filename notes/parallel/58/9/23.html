But the real stress lies on the second part. The whole may be paraphrased thus: "Whilst then it is necessary that what are but tokens of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these things, it is necessary that the heavenly things themselves should be cleansed with better sacrifices than these." The meaning of "these things" might perhaps be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a> (the various instruments of purification), or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a> (the two sin offerings there spoken of); but, from the prominence given to <span class= "ital">repetition</span> in the following verses, the plural seems rather to mean with these sacrifices repeated from time to time. The common thought in the two parts of the verse appears to be (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm" title="Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.">Hebrews 9:21</a>) that everything relating to the covenant of God with sinful man must be brought under the symbol of expiation, without which he can have no part in that covenant. The "heavenly things" are not defiled by sin; but the true heavenly sanctuary cannot be entered by man, the new fellowship between God and man "in heavenly places" cannot be inaugurated, till the heavenly things themselves have been brought into association with the One atoning sacrifice for man.<p><span class= "bld">Better sacrifices.</span>--Here again the use of the plural is remarkable. It seems to arise from the studious generality in the terms of this verse. To "these things" the natural antithesis is "better sacrifices." That in the ministry of the true High Priest there was a presentation of but <span class= "ital">one</span> sacrifice is not assumed here, because it is to be strongly brought out below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25-26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was therefore necessary</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in accordance with the principle above expressed) <span class="cmt_word">that the patterns</span> (rather, <span class="accented">copies</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>, <span class="accented">supra</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span> According to the view taken under Hebrews 8:2 and Hebrews 9:11, "the heavenly things" here must be taken to denote the corresponding realities in the heavenly sphere of things to which Christ has gone. But how can they themselves be said to require purification or cleansing? The mundane tabernacle did, being itself conceived as polluted by human sin; but how so of the unpolluted heavenly tabernacle? The answer may be that the expressions, chosen to suit the case of the earthly type, need not be pressed in all their details as applying to the heavenly sanctuary. With regard to the latter, they may he meant only to express that, though it be itself pure, yet <span class="accented">man</span> requires purification for access to it, and that for this purpose "better sacrifices" are required. "In hac apodosi verbum <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">mundari</span>, subauditum, facit hypallagem: nam <span class="accented">exleslia</span> per se sunt pura, sed nos purificandi fuimus, ut ilia possemus capessere" (Bengel). The general meaning is obvious enough. Commentators sometimes raise needless difficulties, and may sometimes even miss the essential purport of a passage by the too constant application of the critical microscope. If, however, it be thought necessary to find a sense in which the heavenly sanctuary may be said to need purification, the idea may be the appeasing of Divine wrath which bars the entrance of mankind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-28 It is evident that the sacrifices of Christ are infinitely better than those of the law, which could neither procure pardon for sin, nor impart power against it. Sin would still have been upon us, and have had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyed the works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, and happy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep one of the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises or neglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemer liveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience of the church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayer as the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.</body></html>
