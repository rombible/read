The writer's point of view is the time when "Christ entered into heaven itself." In speaking of the repeated "suffering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm" title="Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?">Luke 24:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-46.htm" title="And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:">Luke 24:46</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>he marks the limits within which it must lie, reaching back to the "foundation of the world." The expression in the second part of the verse is the converse of this: looking forward from the "foundation of the world," through all the successive periods of human history until the Incarnation, he writes, "Now once at the end of the world"--"at the consummation of the ages"--hath Christ "been manifested." The words "consummation of the age" occur <span class= "ital">five</span> times in St. Matthew's Gospel--<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-39.htm" title="The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.">Matthew 13:39-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-49.htm" title="So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,">Matthew 13:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>. (See the Notes.) The phrase here is more expressive still. The history of all preceding ages was a preparation for the manifestation of the Christ ("who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times" (literally, <span class= "ital">at the end of the times</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>; all subsequent history develops the results of that manifestation. A similar thought is contained in St. Paul's words "the fulness of the seasons" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), "the fulness of the time" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>). (See further the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">for the annulling of sin through His sacrifice.</span> The word which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.">Hebrews 7:18</a> was used for the abrogation of the command relating to the line of earthly priests, is here applied to the destruction of the power and abolition of the results of sin. As in the manifestation before the face of God we see the proof that the goal which the human high priest failed to reach had been attained, so these words proclaim full deliverance from guilt and penalty, and from the hold of sin itself--a deliverance which the sin-offering could but express in figure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-28 It is evident that the sacrifices of Christ are infinitely better than those of the law, which could neither procure pardon for sin, nor impart power against it. Sin would still have been upon us, and have had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyed the works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, and happy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep one of the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises or neglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemer liveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience of the church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayer as the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.</body></html>
