By "once in the year" we must of course understand on one day of the year, viz., the tenth day of Tisri. On that day, according to Leviticus 16, it was the duty of the high priest to enter the Holy of Holies twice: (1) with the incense and with the blood of the bullock, his own sin-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12-14</a>); (2) with the blood of the same bullock and that of the goat, the sin-offering for the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-19</a>). In the ritual described in the tract "Joma" of the Talmud, he is said to enter four times; the first ministration being separated into its two parts (offering incense, sprinkling the blood of the bullock), and a fourth entering (to bring out the censer) being added.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself and for the errors</span> (literally, <span class="accented">ignorances</span>; cf. ver. 2) <span class="cmt_word">of the people.</span> For the ceremonies on the Day of Atonement, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. They may be summarized, in their main characteristics, thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The high priest brought to the door of the tabernacle a bullock as a sin offering for himself, and two goats as a sin offering for the people; also a ram as a burnt offering for himself, and a ram as a burnt offering for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> After washing and arraying himself in white linen garments (not the ordinary official dress), he cast lots on the two goats which were for the people's sin offering - one lot being "for the LORD," the other "for Azazel;" that on which the former lot fell being for sacrifice, the other to be set free. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> He sacrificed his own sin offering, entered the holy place with the blood thereof, filled a censer with burning coals from the golden altar, went with it within the veil, sprinkling incense on the coals, "that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat, that he die not;" took also the blood within the veil, and sprinkled the mercy-seat therewith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> He returned outside the tabernacle, sacrificed the people's sin offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the goat that was "for the LORD," entered the holy place with its blood, and proceeded as before; sprinkling also the altar of incense, as well as the mercy-seat, with the blood of both sacrifices, to "hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> He again returned outside the tabernacle, laid his hands on the head of the goat "for Azazel," confessing over him "all the iniquities of the children of Israel, putting them on the head of the goat," and sent him away to the wilderness, where he was to be let go. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> He again entered the tabernacle, where he put off his linen garments, and left them there, and then, after washing again, and putting on his ordinary official dress, sacrificed his own and the people's burnt offering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The bodies of the two sin offerings (the bullock and the slain goat) were taken outside the camp, and there entirely consumed by fire. The points in this ceremonial here especially noted are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the entrance within the veil was only "once in the year," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on one only day in the year; for on that day the high priest entered more than once. The meaning is that ordinarily, except on that single day, approach to the innermost shrine was closed to all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That even on that day the high priest <span class="accented">alone</span> entered; neither the people, nor even the priesthood generally, ever had approach to the holiest of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That even he could not enter "without blood;" neither the daily sacrifices nor all the ordinary ceremonial of the Law availed for his access: he must take with him the blood of special sin offerings, or he still could not enter and live. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> This blood he offered "for <span class="accented">himself</span> and for the <span class="accented">ignorances</span> of the people;" for <span class="accented">himself</span>, since he too was "compassed with infirmity," and required atonement (ver. 2), and also for the people's <span class="accented">ignorances.</span> There is a significance in this word. It was not the sins done with a high hand that had to be atoned for on that day; these were either visited by "<span class="accented">cutting</span> off," or atoned for in ways appointed for the purpose: it was the less definite and undetected sinfulness, infecting the whole community, and remaining after all ceremonial cleansing, so as to debar them from coming "boldly to the throne of grace," that was yearly kept in remembrance on the Day of Atonement. Hence before even the high priest could enter and not die, the mercy-seat over "the testimony" which was within the ark must be enveloped with the cloud of incense and sprinkled with the blood which "covereth sin" (the verb translated "make atonement for" means properly "cover"). The sin was still not taken away, only "covered" for the time; for the holy of holies after the ceremony remained closed as before, and the same rites had to be repeated at each yearly entrance. All that was expressed was an ever-recurring need of atonement, not yet effected truly, though symbolically prefigured. <span class="cmt_word">The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all</span> (so the A.V., giving the idea correctly, though the expression is simply <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which <span class="accented">might</span> denote only the holy place, as in ver. 2, if we there read <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, but is used for the holy of holies in vers. 24, 25, and for its heavenly antitype in ver. 13. This last, as typified in the earthly sanctuary, is what is intended here) <span class="cmt_word">hath not yet been made manifest, while as the first tabernacle is yet standing</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">has standing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); has a place in the symbolical representation). The "first tabernacle" here spoken of certainly does not mean the earthly one as opposed to the heavenly, but what the expression denotes throughout the chapter, the holy place in distinction from the holy of holies. How, then, is the continued existence of this a sign that the way to the heavenly holy of holies has not yet been made manifest? Obviously because it intervenes between the congregation and the holy of holies of the earthly tabernacle, debarring all approach to the latter, and even hiding it from their view. This debarring intervention signifies that there is no approach for them as yet to what the holy of holies symbolizes. Further, the ordinary ministry of the priests themselves did not extend beyond this "first tabernacle:" this alone was the sphere of the services which they accomplished daily; and so the very fact of its existing for this purpose expressed that even their mediation was not availing for access to the inner mercy-seat. And that this was so is intimated with peculiar significance by the direction that, when the high priest alone entered within the veil, none even of them should be in the holy place at all, so as to see beyond it: "And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-10 The apostle goes on to speak of the Old Testament services. Christ, having undertaken to be our High Priest, could not enter into heaven till he had shed his blood for us; and none of us can enter, either into God's gracious presence here, or his glorious presence hereafter, but by the blood of Jesus. Sins are errors, great errors, both in judgment and practice; and who can understand all his errors? They leave guilt upon the conscience, not to be washed away but by the blood of Christ. We must plead this blood on earth, while he is pleading it for us in heaven. A few believers, under the Divine teaching, saw something of the way of access to God, of communion with him, and of admission into heaven through the promised Redeemer, but the Israelites in general looked no further than the outward forms. These could not take away the defilement or dominion of sin. They could neither discharge the debts, nor resolve the doubts, of him who did the service. Gospel times are, and should be, times of reformation, of clearer light as to all things needful to be known, and of greater love, causing us to bear ill-will to none, but good-will to all. We have greater freedom, both of spirit and speech, in the gospel, and greater obligations to a more holy living.</body></html>
