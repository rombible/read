Of these the first is taken up here; the second in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25-26</a>. That verse was general: this sets forth the actual fact. "For the sanctuary into which Christ entered is not a copy or a token of the things in the heavens, but heaven itself." "Of like pattern," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>; "the true," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>; "into heaven itself," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Now to appear in the presence of God for</span> <span class= "bld">US.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">now to be made manifest before the face of God for us.</span> We cannot doubt that these words continue the contrast between the true High Priest and the high priest on earth. On the Day of Atonement the high priest came before what was but a symbol of the Divine Presence; he caused the Holiest Place to be filled with the smoke of the incense before he entered with the blood of the offering. He did not dare to delay his return, even by prolonging his prayer, lest he should "excite terror in Israel." In the heavenly sanctuary the High Priest is made manifest before the face of God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>.) Three different words in these verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>) are in the Authorised version rendered by the same word "appear": "to make manifest," "to manifest," "to appear," may serve as renderings which shall keep in mind the difference of the words. The form of the Greek verb might seem to imply a single appearance only; by the added word "now the writer corrects, or rather enlarges, the thought, and shows that the true meaning is a manifestation which is both one and unceasing. With emphasis he places at the close the words which indicate "the people" whose High Priest He has become. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a> his language was "<span class= "ital">we</span> have such a High Priest," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>, "shall purge <span class= "ital">our</span> conscience;" so here, it is on <span class= "ital">our</span> behalf that Christ is manifested unto God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For not into holy places made with hands did Christ enter, which are figures</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">antitypes</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of</span> (literally, <span class="accented">before the face of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>God for us.</span> This verse confirms the view that "the heavenly things" of ver. 23 denoted the heavenly regions into which Christ is entered. <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> at the beginning of the verse may be better translated "holy place" (as at vers. 12 and 25) rather than "places," since here the heavenly counterpart of the holy of holies, as distinguished from the" first tabernacle," appears to be in view, viz. "heaven itself," the heaven of heavens, the immediate presence or "face" of God, the "throne of the Majesty on high," to which Christ passed through the intermediate heavens. There he now (the perpetual <span class="accented">now</span> of the new era of accomplished redemption), in his humanity, in behalf of and representing all humanity, beholds for ever the very face of the eternal God, which Moses could not see and live, and of which the typical high priest saw from year to year but the emblem, in transitory glimpses, through intervening clouds of incense. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23, expresses the idea of the earthly sanctuary being a visible representation answering to a heavenly reality. The original <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">type</span>) was shown to Moses in the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>); what was constructed by him on the earth below was the <span class="accented">antitype</span> to it. The words <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> are elsewhere used to express respectively a prophetic figure of a fulfillment to come and the fulfillment itself (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>, baptism in the latter text being regarded as the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Deluge), but still with the same idea of the <span class="accented">type</span> being prior to the <span class="accented">antitype</span>, the latter answering to the former. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-28 It is evident that the sacrifices of Christ are infinitely better than those of the law, which could neither procure pardon for sin, nor impart power against it. Sin would still have been upon us, and have had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyed the works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, and happy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep one of the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises or neglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemer liveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience of the church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayer as the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.</body></html>
