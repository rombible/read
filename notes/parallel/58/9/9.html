The priests offered sacrifices to God, but were limited to the outer sanctuary, which was not the place of God's manifested presence; a fit symbol this of offerings which cannot purify the conscience (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>). The above rendering follows the best reading of the Greek; in the ordinary text the relative "which," in the second clause, refers to "the time," not to "the first Tabernacle."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, with its usual force) <span class="cmt_word">is a parable for the time present</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> present as regarded from the standpoint of the old dispensation.

The gifts and sacrifices of the Law availed in themselves only for external ceremonial purification; they did not reach, however typical, the sphere of man's inner consciousness; they could not bring about that sense of spiritual accord with God which is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>. as marking the new covenant (see below, vers. 13, 14). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-10 The apostle goes on to speak of the Old Testament services. Christ, having undertaken to be our High Priest, could not enter into heaven till he had shed his blood for us; and none of us can enter, either into God's gracious presence here, or his glorious presence hereafter, but by the blood of Jesus. Sins are errors, great errors, both in judgment and practice; and who can understand all his errors? They leave guilt upon the conscience, not to be washed away but by the blood of Christ. We must plead this blood on earth, while he is pleading it for us in heaven. A few believers, under the Divine teaching, saw something of the way of access to God, of communion with him, and of admission into heaven through the promised Redeemer, but the Israelites in general looked no further than the outward forms. These could not take away the defilement or dominion of sin. They could neither discharge the debts, nor resolve the doubts, of him who did the service. Gospel times are, and should be, times of reformation, of clearer light as to all things needful to be known, and of greater love, causing us to bear ill-will to none, but good-will to all. We have greater freedom, both of spirit and speech, in the gospel, and greater obligations to a more holy living.</body></html>
