Though they were formed on the same general model, their very nature and design necessitated changes of plan and detail which unfitted them for the writer's argument here. So far as the Temple was a copy of the Tabernacle, and so far only, was it made "after the pattern" that Moses had seen; and so far only was its symbolism of divine and not human origin.<p><span class= "bld">The first, wherein was . . .</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>, when the writer passes from place to ministration, he uses the present tense, although it is of the Tabernacle that he is speaking. The explanation is that which has come before us again and again: the arrangements prescribed in Scripture are to him ever present, abiding from age to age in that unchanging word. Hence probably we should here read <span class= "ital">are</span> instead of "were." The golden candlestick, the table, and the showbread <span class= "ital">are</span> in the Holy Place as it is described in the Law. With the symbolical meaning of the furniture of the Holy Place we are not here concerned. The writer contents himself with words which plainly imply that none of the parts and arrangements of the Tabernacle were without significance. On the golden candlestick (more strictly, <span class= "ital">lampstand</span>) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31-37</a>, and on the ten candlesticks of the Temple of Solomon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm" title="And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,">1Kings 7:49</a>; on the table and the showbread, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-23.htm" title="You shall also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:23-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/24-5.htm" title="And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.">Leviticus 24:5-9</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-48.htm" title="And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the show bread was,">1Kings 7:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-8.htm" title="He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basins of gold.">2Chronicles 4:8</a>). It is somewhat remarkable that the table should here be so distinctly mentioned, for usually (both in the Bible and in Jewish tradition) no special importance appears to be assigned to it apart from the offering which was placed thereon. (Comp., however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-6.htm" title="And you shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure table before the LORD.">Leviticus 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm" title="And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the show bread also set they in order on the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but you have forsaken him.">2Chronicles 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-7.htm" title="You offer polluted bread on my altar; and you say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.">Malachi 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-12.htm" title="But you have profaned it, in that you say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.">Malachi 1:12</a>.) This offering is in Hebrew called "bread of the face"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>bread of the (divine) Presence; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-4.htm" title="How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?">Matthew 12:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-4.htm" title="How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the show bread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?">Luke 6:4</a>, "loaves of the setting forth;" here "the setting forth of the loaves."<p><span class= "bld">Sanctuary.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">holy place.</span> The same word is applied to the Holy of Holies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>; and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm" title="For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.">Hebrews 13:11</a>. This verse and the next give the proper names of the two parts of the Tabernacle, which must be used when the one is to be distinguished from the other. Where there is no risk of mistake the simpler designation is sufficient. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-17.htm" title="And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.">Leviticus 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-20.htm" title="And when he has made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:">Leviticus 16:20</a>.)

The account of them is from the Pentateuch, and describes them as they originally were. In the then existing temple there were neither ark, mercy-seat, nor cherubim, though the ceremonies were continued as though they had been still there. The ark had been removed or destroyed in the sack by the Chaldeans, and was never replaced (for the Jewish tradition on the subject, see 2 Macc. 2:1-8). Josephus says ('Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. 5) that in the temple of his day there was nothing whatever behind the veil in the holy of holies; and Tacitus informs us ('Hist.,' v 9) that, when Pompey entered the temple, he found there "vacuam sedem et inania arcana." A stone basement is said by the rabbis to have occupied the ark's place, called "lapis fundationis." In the "first tabernacle," called "the holy place" (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> probably, not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a neuter plural, equivalent to "the holies"), the table of shewbread (with its twelve loaves in two rows, changed weekly) stood on the north side, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the right as one approached the veil; and opposite to it, on the left, the seven-branched golden candlestick, or lamp-stand, carrying an oil-lamp on each branch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 37, 40</a>.). Between them, close to the veil stood the golden altar of incense (ibid.); which, nevertheless, is not mentioned here as part of the furniture of the "first tabernacle," being associated with the "second," for reasons which will be seen. The "second veil" was that between the holy place and the holy of holies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-35.htm">Exodus 36:35</a>), the curtain at the entrance of the holy place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-37.htm">Exodus 36:37</a>) being regarded as the first. The inner sanctuary behind this second veil is spoken of as <span class="accented">having</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) in the first place "a golden <span class="accented">censer</span>," as the word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is translated in the A.V. (so also in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">thuribulum</span>). But it assuredly means the" golden altar of incense," though this stood locally outside the veil. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> otherwise there would be no mention at all of this altar, which was so important in the symbolism of the tabernacle, and so prominent in the Pentateuch, from which the whole description is taken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The alternative view of its being a censer reserved for the use of the high priest, when he entered behind the veil on the Day of Atonement, has no support from the Pentateuch, in which no such censer is mentioned as part of the standing furniture of the tabernacle, and none of <span class="accented">gold is</span> spoken of at all; nor, had it been so, would it have been placed, any more than the altar of incense, <span class="accented">within</span> the veil, since the high priest required it <span class="accented">before</span> he entered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Though the word itself, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, certainly means" censer," and not "altar of incense," in the LXX., yet in the Hellenistic writers it is otherwise. Philo and Josephus, and also Clemens Alexandrinus and Origen, always call the altar of incense <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>; and the language of the Epistle is Hellenistic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The wording does not of necessity imply that what is spoken of was locally <span class="accented">within</span> the veil: it is not said (as where the actual <span class="accented">contents</span> of the "first tabernacle" and of the ark are spoken <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented">wherein</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>), but <span class="accented">having</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), which need only mean <span class="accented">having as belonging to it</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> connected with its symbolism. It was an appendage to the holy of holies, though not actually inside it, in the same way (to use a homely illustration given by Delitzsch) as the sign-board of a shop belongs to the shop and not to the street. It is, indeed, so regarded in the Old Testament. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>, "Before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>, "The altar which was <span class="accented">by</span> the oracle," or, "<span class="accented">belonging to</span> the oracle;" cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>, where, in the visions of the heavenly temple based upon the symbolism of the earthly, the altar of incense is associated with the Divine throne. And it was also so associated in the ceremonial of the tabernacle. The smoke of the incense daily offered on it was supposed to penetrate the veil to the holy of holies, representing the sweet savor of intercession before the mercy-seat itself; and on the Day of Atonement, not only was its incense taken by the high priest within the veil, but also it, as well as the mercy-seat, was sprinkled with the atoning blood. Of the rest of the things described as belonging to the holy of holies, it is to be observed that, though none of them were in it when the Epistle was written, yet all (except the pot of manna and Aaron's rod) were essential to its significance, as will be seen; and all, with these two exceptions, were in Solomon's temple as well as in the original tabernacle. An objection that has been raised to the accuracy of the description, on the ground that the pot and the rod are not said in the Pentateuch to have been placed <span class="accented">inside</span> the ark, is groundless. They were to be laid up "before the LORD" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>); "before the testimony" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>); and "the testimony" elsewhere means the tables of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>, etc.), which were within the ark. It was most likely that they would be kept for safe preservation in the same place with the" testimony," <span class="accented">before</span> which they were ever to be. Further, what is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-10.htm">2 Chronicles 5:10</a>) of there being nothing in the ark but the two tables of stone when it was moved into Solomon's temple, is no proof that nothing else had been originally there. It seems, indeed, rather to favor the idea that there had been, as implying that something more might have been expected to be found there. The mercy-seat, as is well known, was the cover of the ark, over which the wings of the two cherubim were spread. The expression, "cherubim of glory," probably has reference to the luminous cloud, significant of the Divine presence, which, occasionally at least (there is no sufficient ground for concluding it to have been a permanent manifestation), is said to have been seen above them. The cherubim, whatever their exact significance, are represented as accompaniments of the Divine glory (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and 10.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 The apostle shows to the Hebrews the typical reference of their ceremonies to Christ. The tabernacle was a movable temple, shadowing forth the unsettled state of the church upon earth, and the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily. The typical meaning of these things has been shown in former remarks, and the ordinances and articles of the Mosaic covenant point out Christ as our Light, and as the Bread of life to our souls; and remind us of his Divine Person, his holy priesthood, perfect righteousness, and all-prevailing intercession. Thus was the Lord Jesus Christ, all and in all, from the beginning. And as interpreted by the gospel, these things are a glorious representation of the wisdom of God, and confirm faith in Him who was prefigured by them.</body></html>
