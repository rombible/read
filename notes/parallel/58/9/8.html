These external arrangements show that the way into the Holy Place (of the Tabernacle) is not open: by this the Holy Spirit, whose word we are reading whenever we trace the injunctions of the Law, teaches this lesson, that the way into God's immediate presence is not yet manifest.<p><span class= "bld">While as the first tabernacle was yet standing.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">while the first tabernacle yet has place</span> (or, <span class= "ital">standing</span>)<span class= "ital">, i.e., </span>whilst there exists such a distinction as that between "the first Tabernacle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>), and "the second." It is impossible to understand "the first Tabernacle" in any other sense than that which it bears in the early part of the sentence--the Holy Place as distinguished from the Holiest of all. This outer Tabernacle, however, may be looked at from different points of view. On the one hand, it was the place from which (as well as from the inner sanctuary) the people generally were excluded; and on the other, it was the place beyond which the ministration of the priests in general might not extend. It is the latter that corresponds to the thought of this verse. The contrast between the body of priests and the people hardly meets us once in the whole Epistle, except in a very small number of general statements (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-14.htm" title="For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.">Hebrews 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-4.htm" title="For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:">Hebrews 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>); the only contrast is between the one Priest or High Priest and all who approach unto God through Him. Not the Jewish economy, but that to which it pointed, is the subject of the writer's thoughts: Christ's people are now the priests, who offer through Him their constant sacrifice. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-13.htm" title="Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.">Hebrews 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm" title="By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.">Hebrews 13:15</a>.) Those who ministered in "the first Tabernacle" (who are looked upon merely as substitutes for the people, performing the "services" in their place, and as their representatives) were excluded, not from entrance only, but even from sight of the place of God's presence. What was thereby "signified" we have already seen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-10 The apostle goes on to speak of the Old Testament services. Christ, having undertaken to be our High Priest, could not enter into heaven till he had shed his blood for us; and none of us can enter, either into God's gracious presence here, or his glorious presence hereafter, but by the blood of Jesus. Sins are errors, great errors, both in judgment and practice; and who can understand all his errors? They leave guilt upon the conscience, not to be washed away but by the blood of Christ. We must plead this blood on earth, while he is pleading it for us in heaven. A few believers, under the Divine teaching, saw something of the way of access to God, of communion with him, and of admission into heaven through the promised Redeemer, but the Israelites in general looked no further than the outward forms. These could not take away the defilement or dominion of sin. They could neither discharge the debts, nor resolve the doubts, of him who did the service. Gospel times are, and should be, times of reformation, of clearer light as to all things needful to be known, and of greater love, causing us to bear ill-will to none, but good-will to all. We have greater freedom, both of spirit and speech, in the gospel, and greater obligations to a more holy living.</body></html>
