There is an apparent difficulty here. The priests, it is urged, did not receive tithes from the people; the tithe was paid to the Levites, and but the tenth part of this tithe fell to the lot of the priests. Two considerations seem entirely to remove this difficulty. (1) The question is not one of emolument, but of position. The authority to exact tithes was in strictness vested in the priests, the supreme guardians of the laws relating to all religious duties and observances, and the Levites were but their assistants. That the priests received for their own use but a part of the tribute paid by the nation is a matter of no moment here. (2) The Levites themselves paid tithes to the priests, who therefore stood alone in receiving tithes but paying none. It is the positive ordinance of the law, and nothing but this, that raises brethren above brethren, and gives to the priest this claim upon men who would otherwise be on an equality with himself through common descent from Abraham.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they indeed of the song of Levi who receive the office of priesthood have commandment to receive tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham: but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath received tithes of Abraham</span>. As much as to say, "Let it not be said that the tithing of Abraham by Melchizedek implies no higher priestly prerogative than the tithing of Abraham's descendants by the sons of Aaron; for there is this difference: They, in virtue only of a special ordinance of the Law, not of original right, were allowed to tithe their brethren, though descended from the same great ancestor; he, though not of them or of the race at all, in virtue of his own inherent dignity, tithes the whole race as represented in its patriarch." (We observe how, in place of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, used when the mere historical incident was referred to, we have here the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> (as also <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> in what follows, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 9), denoting a completed act, of which the effects and significance remain; Melchizedek, who represents the priesthood after his order, being viewed in permanent relation to Abraham, who represents the chosen race.) And hath blessed him that hath (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the holder of) the promises. But, without all controversy, the less is blessed of the better. The superiority evidenced by bestowal of blessing no less than by receiving of tithe having been thus noticed, the contrast with the Levitical priesthood is continued in the following verses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:4-10 That High Priest who should afterward appear, of whom Melchizedec was a type, must be much superior to the Levitical priests. Observe Abraham's great dignity and happiness; that he had the promises. That man is rich and happy indeed, who has the promises, both of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. This honour have all those who receive the Lord Jesus. Let us go forth in our spiritual conflicts, trusting in his word and strength, ascribing our victories to his grace, and desiring to be met and blessed by him in all our ways.</body></html>
