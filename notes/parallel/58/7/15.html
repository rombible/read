"And what we are speaking of is yet more abundantly evident if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth a different priest, who hath been made (priest) not according to a law of a carnal commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life." Hitherto, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-12.htm" title="For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.">Hebrews 7:12-14</a>, the thought has rested on what is <span class= "ital">given up,--</span>viz., the priesthood of Aaron, set aside by the words of prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>); and so far as these three verses are concerned, nothing more might be intended than the transference of the priesthood to <span class= "ital">another line of men.</span> Far more striking will the proof appear, when we look on the other side, and observe what is <span class= "ital">brought in</span>--a priesthood like Melchizedek's, resting not on mere positive enactment, but assumed by inherent power, by right of "life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-8.htm" title="And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.">Hebrews 7:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it is yet more abundantly evident</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the proposition of ver. 12), <span class="cmt_word">if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another Priest, who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless</span> (indissoluble) <span class="cmt_word">life</span>. For it is testified (of him), Thou art a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. This is a resumption of what has been already seen, put so as to be effective for the present stage of the argument. The old priesthood, and consequently the <span class="accented">Law</span>, is changed and superseded, not only because the Priest of the new order of things is of the tribe of Judah, but still more evidently because his priesthood is witnessed to as being one of a different kind, and of a kind so much higher and diviner. It is evident that the Antitype of Melchizedek, the subject of the hundred and tenth psalm, rather than Melchizedek himself, suggests here the language used. (Observe the contrasts between <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm">Hebrews 9:8-15</a> is in Chose few pregnant words briefly anticipated, after the manner of the Epistle.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-25 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are done away; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which true believers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.</body></html>
