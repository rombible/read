(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-3.htm" title="And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.">Hebrews 5:3</a>.) The <span class= "ital">annual</span> recurrence of that day is distinctly referred to more than once in this Epistle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm" title="But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.">Hebrews 10:3</a>): hence the words now before us, which seem to imply <span class= "ital">daily</span> sacrifices thus offered by the high priests, have given rise to much discussion. Neither the morning and evening sacrifices nor the daily meat-offering of the high priest could have been spoken of in the terms here used, which in their natural meaning suit the ritual of the Day of Atonement, and that alone. It is true--and passages of Philo and the Talmud are appositely quoted to illustrate the fact--that, as the high priest was represented by all other priests, their actions were counted as his; but it seems impossible to think that the words have no more significance than this. Either we must take "daily" as equivalent to "day by day" (as the Jews were accustomed to speak of the Day of Atonement as "the day"),--which will give us the meaning, "on each recurrence of this sacred day;" or we must connect the word, not with the Jewish high priests, but with Jesus alone. The order of the Greek would of itself suggest this latter arrangement of the words. If it is correct, the choice of the word "daily" presents but little difficulty. There could be no question of <span class= "ital">years</span> in regard to the ministration of the Lord Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary; and "daily" was perhaps the most natural word in such a case, when the frequently stated repetition of a sacrifice was the thought to be expressed.<p><span class= "bld">For this he did once.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">once for all.</span> These words and those that follow, "when He offered up Himself," are best understood as a parenthesis. The truth stated in the former part of the verse, that Jesus needeth not, like the high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then "for those of the people," finds its explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-28.htm" title="For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for ever more.">Hebrews 7:28</a>, "For the Law," &c. But, having introduced the thought of a sacrifice for the sins of the people--a thought not yet expressly mentioned in any part of the Epistle in connection with Jesus, though virtually presented, as we have seen, in many earlier words--the writer will not pass on without the most emphatic statement that such a sacrifice was offered, once for all, in the sacrifice of Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</span> The expression "daily" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) is not in strictness applicable to the high priest, who did not offer the daily sacrifice. The reference throughout what follows being to the high priest's peculiar functions on the Day of Atonement, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> might have been expected. There are two tenable solutions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the daily offerings of the priests are regarded as made by the high priest, who represented the whole priesthood, on the principle, <span class="accented">qui facit per altos tacit per se</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (as is suggested by its position in the sentence) belongs not to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, but only to Christ: "<span class="accented">who</span> <span class="accented">has no need daily, as the high priests have yearly</span>:" for <span class="accented">his</span> intercession being perpetual, an offering on his part would be needed daily, if needed at all. This view is supported by the fact that the <span class="accented">daily</span> sacrifices are not spoken of in the Law as including a special one in the first place for the priest's own sin. "This he did." Did what? Offer for his own sins as well as for the people's? No; for, though it has been seen above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) how the high priest's offering for himself might have its counterpart in the agony, the Sinless One cannot be said to have offered for sins of his own. And, besides, he having offered <span class="accented">himself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), the offering could not be <span class="accented">for</span> himself. We must, therefore, take "this he did" as referring only to the latter part of the preceding clause, while <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> answers to the former part; or as implying generally, "did all that was needed for atonement." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:26-28 Observe the description of the personal holiness of Christ. He is free from all habits or principles of sin, not having the least disposition to it in his nature. No sin dwells in him, not the least sinful inclination, though such dwells in the best of Christians. He is harmless, free from all actual transgression; he did no violence, nor was there any deceit in his mouth. He is undefiled. It is hard to keep ourselves pure, so as not to partake the guilt of other men's sins. But none need be dismayed who come to God in the name of his beloved Son. Let them be assured that he will deliver them in the time of trial and suffering, in the time of prosperity, in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment.</body></html>
