In His supplication unto God, "who was able to save Him out of death," He was heard; this was the type--and more than the type (see the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>)--of the eternal salvation of which He, when made perfect, becomes the Author. The connecting link between the priestly office and "salvation" appears, therefore, to be the prevalent intercession of which this verse speaks--an intercession which implies all that has preceded in His priestly ministration. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That come unto God by him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that approach through Him to God.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>, where full expression is given to the thought here briefly indicated. He leads and represents His people, and is the medium of their approach to God.<p><span class= "bld">To make intercession for them.</span>--The word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns?

The thought meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>. With the high priest's confession of the sins of the people on the Day of Atonement was joined fervent intercession on their behalf; this intercession was also symbolised in the offering of the incense.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26-28</a> look back on all that has preceded, since the beginning of the fifth chapter, and prepare the way for the subsequent sections. The type afforded by Melchizedek has yielded its lessons, and to this there is no further reference. The mention of the <span class= "ital">high priest</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>, taking up <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-10.htm" title="Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:10</a>) is resumed. The unique special teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a> was far from bringing out the full significance of the priesthood of Jesus; for the sacred history does not connect Melchizedek with any of the most prominent high-priestly functions, or with any temple or place of ministration. The abrogation of the Levitical priesthood and the infinite elevation of the "other Priest" above those of the order of Aaron have been so clearly set forth that it is possible henceforth to concentrate attention on the types and lessons furnished by the Jewish ritual itself. Hence there is the closest connection (as has been already mentioned) between these verses and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1-5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</span> We again observe how, at the end of successive stages of the argument, thoughts to be enlarged on afterwards are brought in. Here it is the perpetual intercession of Christ before the heavenly mercy-seat. In the view of his office thus arrived at there is, in fact, a transition to the main subject set forth in the three chapters that follow; viz. the fulfillment in Christ of the ceremonial of the Law, and especially of the high priest's intercession on the Day of Atonement. And thus from Melchizedek the train of thought passes to the high priest. The type of the former has been sufficiently shown to be fulfilled in the <span class="accented">higher order</span> of Christ's priesthood; it is now to be shown how, being of such higher order, it is the antitype of the Aaronic priesthood too, accomplishing what it signified. Hence in ver. 26 the word "high priest" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) is for the first time introduced, as the key-note of what is coming. <span class="accented">Summary of the foregoing argument.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">I.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1-11</a>.) What does the Melchizedek priesthood of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. signify? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> (vers. 1 - 4.) One not depending on human ancestry, and one forever abiding. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> (vers. 4 -11.) One of a higher order than that of Aaron; for: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Melchizedek, being of a race apart, received tithe from Abraham <span class="accented">the patriarch.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> This denotes a higher position than that of the Aaronic priests, who tithed their brethren of the same race with themselves, in virtue only of a special ordinance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The <span class="accented">blessing</span> of Abraham by Melchizedek is similarly significant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The idea of an ever-living priest with a right to tithe transcends that of the temporary claims of a succession of dying men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Levi himself virtually paid tithe to Melchizedek. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">II.</span> (vers. 11-18.) The Aaronic priesthood, and with it the whole dispensation based upon it, is thus shown to have been imperfect and transitory; for: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Otherwise a priesthood of another order would not have been spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Which priesthood is evidently distinct from the Aaronic, our Lord being of the tribe, not of Levi, but of Judah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> What has been seen (vers. 5 and 8) as to the Melchizedek priesthood being not "after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life," makes this "more abundantly evident." <span class="accented">Conclusion</span> (vers. 18-20). The Antonio priesthood (being in itself unprofitable) is therefore now superseded by an availing one, "through which we draw nigh unto God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">III.</span> (vers. 20-26.) Christ's priesthood <span class="accented">is</span> thus availing; for: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The Divine oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) established it, marking it as resting on the eternal Divine counsels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is (as shown by the same psalm) "unchangeable." The one Priest abides forever. <span class="accented">Conclusion</span> (ver. 25). We have, therefore, in him at last, a perfectly availing and eternal interceding High Priest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-25 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are done away; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which true believers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.</body></html>
