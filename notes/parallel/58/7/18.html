They point out with greater fulness and clearness what is involved in the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>. "For there is an annulling of a preceding commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness (for the Law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, by which we draw nigh unto God." (It must be borne in mind throughout that by the "commandment" is meant the ordinance <span class= "ital">which created the Levitical priesthood, </span>not the Law in general.) That Jesus was not made Priest according to a law of a carnal commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>) involves the annulling of that commandment; in His becoming Priest according to a power of indissoluble life is involved the introduction of a better hope. This is the general meaning, but each division of the thought is expanded. The appointment of a different priest by the very authority on which the former commandment rested, the divine decree, showed that commandment to be of force no longer: as we have already seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>), this is because the commandment is weak and unprofitable--because the priesthood it creates cannot attain the end of its institution, which is to bring men into fellowship with God. The parenthesis, "for the Law made nothing perfect," points out that the weakness just spoken of corresponds to that imperfection which confessedly belongs to the earlier dispensation: even the Jew (who would have accounted a change of priestly line impossible) expected perfection only when Messiah should have appeared. When the earlier commandment is annulled, in its place there is brought in a better hope. The "better hope" stands connected with the "better covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>) and the "better promises" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>). "And by this (better hope) we draw nigh unto God." The end of the priesthood therefore is attained. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>.) In the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm" title="Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.">Leviticus 10:3</a>) the priests are "those who come nigh unto God," that is, in the service of the sanctuary: with a nobler meaning this name shall now belong to all God's people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof</span> (for the Law made nothing perfect); <span class="cmt_word">but</span> [there is on the other hand] <span class="cmt_word">a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God</span>. Such is certainly the construction of the sentence (not as in the A.V.); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, etc., in ver. 19 being parenthetical, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> depending on <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 18. We have here the conclusion of the argument of the vers. 11-18, with a further expression of the inherent insufficiency of the Law, given as the reason of its supersession; reminding us of similar views of what the Law was worth frequent in St. Paul's Epistles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>, etc.). The final clause, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>, leads directly up to the main subject in the writer's view, viz. the exposition of Christ's eternal priesthood. But two proofs are first to be given of Christ's priesthood being, unlike the Aaronic, thus eternally availing to bring us near to God. These proofs are to be found in the Divine oath which established it, and the expression, "forever," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, once more adduced. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-25 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are done away; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which true believers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.</body></html>
