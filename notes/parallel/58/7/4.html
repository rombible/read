(in Chronicles only) for the head of a family or chief of a clan. In the New Testament it is used of David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm" title="Men and brothers, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.">Acts 2:29</a>, and twice in Acts 7 of Jacob's sons.<p>The next verse deals with the same subject, but under a new aspect. Here the thought is, Melchizedek received tithes even from Abraham the patriarch; there, He has been thus honoured, though no enactment of law invested him with superior rights.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, even gave a tenth of the spoils</span>. The typical significance of Melchizedek is now further seen in what passed between him and Abraham, in respect to tithe and blessing. Alford's inference, that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, referring as it does, not to the antitype, but to the man himself, implies some mysterious greatness beyond what appears in the original record, does not follow. Of one who simply blessed and received tithes from the great patriarch, the expression is not too strong. Observe the emphatic position, at the end of the Greek sentence, of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "he, the patriarch." Abraham's being this, the father and representative of the chosen race, is what is shown in what follows to give peculiar significance to the transaction. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (properly, "the chief spoils"), which is not in the LXX., seems introduced to enhance the picture: "Quae Abrahami proprie fuerant, ut victoris" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:4-10 That High Priest who should afterward appear, of whom Melchizedec was a type, must be much superior to the Levitical priests. Observe Abraham's great dignity and happiness; that he had the promises. That man is rich and happy indeed, who has the promises, both of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. This honour have all those who receive the Lord Jesus. Let us go forth in our spiritual conflicts, trusting in his word and strength, ascribing our victories to his grace, and desiring to be met and blessed by him in all our ways.</body></html>
