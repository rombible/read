But he, because of his abiding forever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.</span> This second point of contrast has already been twice touched on - ver. 8, with respect to the claim to tithe; and ver. 16, with respect to the order of priesthood: here it is with especial reference to the eternal personality, and hence the perpetual and complete efficiency, of our one Priest. The repetitions are not tautological, having each time different bearings. The contrast here, as before, is between mortal men who succeed each other in the office of priesthood, and One who has the office inherent in himself forever. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "unchangeable") is taken by some in an intransitive sense, as in margin of the A.V., <span class="accented">that doth not pass to another</span>, equivalent <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. This, however, is not the proper force of this late Greek word, nor does the sense of the passage of necessity require it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-25 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are done away; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which true believers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.</body></html>
