The thought of high priest immediately brings to mind the annual Day of Atonement, to which belonged the characteristic ministration of the high priest. As we read the following words we cannot doubt their direct reference to the ceremonial observances of that day.<p><span class= "bld">Holy.</span>--Not the word of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>, but a word seldom used in the New Testament (except in quotations), though of frequent occurrence in the LXX. (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-8.htm" title="And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm" title="But know that the LORD has set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him.">Psalm 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-9.htm" title="Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; and let your saints shout for joy.">Psalm 132:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-16.htm" title="I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.">Psalm 132:16</a>): the idea contained is that of <span class= "ital">holy purity.</span> The next word may denote either freedom from malice or evil, or freedom from guile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm" title="For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.">Romans 16:18</a>); the former meaning is more likely here. The three words, denoting personal purity and innocence and freedom from all pollution of sin, present the idea of which the ceremonial purity of the high priest was the type. Seven days before the Day of Atonement the high priest left his house and took up his abode in the Temple, that, thus separated from men and things unclean, he might when the day arrived be found free from all defilement; five washings and ten purifications were required of him on the day itself.<p><span class= "bld">Separate from sinners.</span>--These words may be understood in two ways--as connecting themselves either with what goes before or with the following words. If they extend the idea expressed by "undefined," they point to the perfect sinlessness of our Lord, who lived amongst sinners and yet was ever separated from their sin--not needing external separation to preserve Him from pollution. If this member is to be joined with the following, it points to the complete severance which now exists: our exalted Lord is for ever removed from a life in the midst of transgressors. The latter view receives some support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>, but is on other grounds less probable. With the concluding words comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm" title="He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)">Ephesians 4:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For such a High Priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.</span> Such a High Priest, it is said, for us was fitting. The same word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> was used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>, where the humiliation of Christ was spoken cf. It was there said that to make the Captain of our salvation perfect through suffering "became" God - was befitting to what we conceive of the Divine nature. It is now said that our High Priest's being such as is here described "became" us - was befitting to our state and needs. That he should be both human and superhuman was in all respects fitting - the one that he might be our sympathizing brother; the other that his intercession might avail. The further description of him in this verse is suggested by the qualifications of the Aaronic high priest, what they typified being realized in Christ. The high priest was by his consecration a holy person, <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6, 8</a>, etc.); he bore on his miter "<span class="accented">Holiness to the Lord"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>); he must be without personal blemish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17</a>, etc.); he must keep himself continually from all ceremonial pollution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a>. and 22.); he must purify himself by a sacrifice for himself and by special ablutions before entering the holy of holies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.); when there, he was conceived as in God's presence, apart from the world of sinners outside. Christ was not only <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, personally and inwardly holy (Christians in the New Testament are all called <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but not all <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: for the use of which word, el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm">Titus 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-34.htm">Acts 13:34</a>, where it is applied to Christ, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4-16:5</a>, where it is applied to God as his special attribute, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); Christ was actually free from evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) and undefiled (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). by any contact of sin; and as such he has passed to God's actual presence (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>), separated forever from the world of sinners. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:26-28 Observe the description of the personal holiness of Christ. He is free from all habits or principles of sin, not having the least disposition to it in his nature. No sin dwells in him, not the least sinful inclination, though such dwells in the best of Christians. He is harmless, free from all actual transgression; he did no violence, nor was there any deceit in his mouth. He is undefiled. It is hard to keep ourselves pure, so as not to partake the guilt of other men's sins. But none need be dismayed who come to God in the name of his beloved Son. Let them be assured that he will deliver them in the time of trial and suffering, in the time of prosperity, in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment.</body></html>
