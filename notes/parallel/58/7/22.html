As the priest whose appointment is confirmed by the oath of God is raised above all former priests, in the same proportion is the covenant of which Jesus is surety higher, better, than the former covenant. For the "better hope" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a> we now read "better covenant"; the new idea is not different in substance, but is more definite and clear. The very promise of the "other priest" brought with it a "better hope"; the recollection of the divine oath is fitly succeeded by the mention of a "covenant."<p>This is the first occurrence in this Epistle of a very interesting word (<span class= "ital">diath?k</span>?) which hereafter will occupy an important place in the argument. Throughout the Greek translation of the Old Testament it is used to represent a Hebrew word which is (more than 200 times) rightly rendered <span class= "ital">covenant</span> in our version; and, like the Hebrew word, it is applied both to mutual agreements between man and man, and to "covenants" or engagements into which God enters in regard <span class= "ital">to</span> man. In classical writers <span class= "ital">diath?k?</span> commonly denotes a <span class= "ital">testament;</span> and hence in the old Latin translation of the Scriptures <span class= "ital">testamentum</span> became the common rendering of the word. As, however, this rendering is very often found where it is impossible to think of such a meaning as <span class= "ital">will</span> (for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-5.htm" title="For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against you:">Psalm 83:5</a>, where no one will suppose the Psalmist to say that the enemies of God "have arranged a <span class= "ital">testament</span> against Him"), it is plain that the Latin <span class= "ital">testamentum</span> was used with an extended meaning, answering to the wide application of the Greek word. St. Paul's designation of the Jewish Scriptures as "the Old Covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm" title="But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.">2Corinthians 3:14</a>) thus became familiarly known as <span class= "ital">The Old Testament.</span> In the New Testament the Authorised version more commonly presents the better rendering; but, through the influence of the Latin, <span class= "ital">testament</span> is retained in several places--viz., in the various accounts of the institution of the Lord's Supper; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm" title="But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.">2Corinthians 3:14</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm" title="And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightning, and voices, and thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail.">Revelation 11:19</a> ("the ark of His testament," a very strange translation); in the present verse; and especially in the very important passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-20</a>. There is a very general agreement of opinion that "covenant" must be the true meaning in all passages of the New Testament except the one last mentioned; and even in that place there are strong reasons for retaining the same rendering. (See the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>.) In this verse, at all events, we cannot doubt that the writer is thinking of a covenant. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:">Hebrews 8:8</a>.) Here only is Jesus spoken of as Surety, elsewhere as Mediator (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>). As through the Son of Man the covenant becomes established, so in Him it remains secure; the words addressed by God to Him as Priest and King contain the pledge of its validity and permanence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-25 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are done away; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which true believers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.</body></html>
