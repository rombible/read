"abideth a priest continually;" the connection with the last chapter, therefore, is very clear. Of Melchizedek we know nothing beyond what we learn from the brief narrative of Genesis 14. A Jewish legend, preserved in the later Targums on the Pentateuch, but not in the Targum of Onkelos, identifies him with the patriarch Shem; and many conjectures of a later date (stimulated by the remarkable language of these verses) have been far wilder in their extravagance. It may be that the result of these speculations has been to invest this chapter with a mystery which does not belong to it. The object of the writer is, in reality, very simple--to deal with the question, What is the import of the divine utterance that David's Lord is a "Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek"? Not to take up the history of Melchizedek and allegorise each part, but to point out the full meaning of the comparison made in the prophecy, which declares the priesthood of the future King to be "after the order of Melchizedek--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to be such as the priesthood of Melchizedek typically set forth. The first part of this sentence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1-2</a>, as far as ". . . tenth part of all") enumerates the known facts of the history of Melchizedek; the following clauses are occupied with the interpretation of the history, and with inferences from it. Of the facts recorded in Genesis none are passed over, except the gift of bread and wine; the blessing also is mentioned in general terms only. The language of the LXX. is, as a rule, closely followed throughout.<p><span class= "bld">King of Salem.</span>--Jewish tradition affirms strongly that this Salem occupied the site on which Jerusalem afterwards stood; and certainly Salem is a poetic name of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm" title="In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.">Psalm 76:2</a>). This tradition, found in Josephus and in the earliest of the Targums, agrees well with the circumstances of the narrative as far as we can follow them, and seems to deserve acceptance. Jerome maintained that Salem was situated near Scythopolis, where in his day were pointed out ruins of "Melchizedek's palace." Another tradition (probably of Samaritan origin) makes Mount Gerizim the place of meeting, in which case the city of Melchizedek would probably be near Shechem.<p><span class= "bld">The most high God.</span>--A title characteristic of the narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>). Melchizedek is the first who in Scripture is spoken of as priest, and the name is given without explanation. As in the earliest times this office was held by the head of a family (Job 1), it is not remarkable to find a union of regal and sacerdotal functions in the same man.<p><span class= "bld">Returning from the slaughter.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">from the smiting, </span>or <span class= "ital">defeat.</span> According to the narrative in Genesis the meeting took place "after Abraham had returned" from the defeat of the king; but probably the meaning does not differ from that here given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this Melchizedek, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all</span> (this description belongs to the subject of the sentence, being merely a recapitulation of the facts recorded in Genesis, the language of the LXX. being used; what follows belongs properly to the predicate, being of the nature of a comment on the facts recorded); <span class="cmt_word">first, being by interpretation King of righteousness</span> (which is the meaning of the name Melchizedek), <span class="cmt_word">and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace</span> (the very names of himself and his kingdom are significant (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>); where righteousness and peace are the characteristics of the Messiah's kingdom; this significance, however, is not afterwards made a point of, being merely noticed by the way); <span class="cmt_word">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</span> It is this language especially that has been supposed to involve something more than human about the historical Melchizedek. But we have only to enter into the mind of the writer to see that it is not so. For it is the ideal of the psalm, conceived as suggested by the historical type, that gives its color to the language used. And, indeed, how strangely suggestive is that fragment about the priestly king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-21</a>) so unexpectedly interposed in the life of Abraham! In the midst of a history in which such a point is made of the parentage and descent of the patriarchs of Israel, at a time of peculiar glory of the first and greatest of them, one suddenly appears on the scene, a priest and king, not of the peculiar race at all, his parentage and ancestry unrecorded and unknown, who blesses and receives tithes from Abraham, and then as suddenly disappears from view. We hear no more of him; as about his origin, so about his end, Scripture is silent. And so he "abides" before the mind's eye, apart from any before or after, the type of an unchanging priesthood. For the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in itself denoting the absence, not of ancestors, but of a traced genealogy), cf. ver. 6, 6 <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. That of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, is illustrated by the Latin expression, "Nullis majoribus ortus." On "made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) unto the Son of God," Chrysostom says, "We know of no beginning or end in either case; in the one, because none are recorded; in the other, because they do not exist." The idea seems to be that Melchizedek is thus assimilated to Christ in the sacred record, by what it leaves untold no less than by what it tells. It is not said that he is like him (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), but made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> represented in such wise as to resemble him. It may be here remarked that, though the term "Son of God" is used in the Epistle generally to denote the Messiah as manifested in time, his essential eternal being is here, as elsewhere, distinctly intimated; also that "the Son of God" is regarded as the archetype of the comparison: "Non dicitur Filius DEI assimilatus Melchizedeko, sed contra; nam Filius DEI est antiquior et archetypus" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-3 Melchizedec met Abraham when returning from the rescue of Lot. His name, King of Righteousness, doubtless suitable to his character, marked him as a type of the Messiah and his kingdom. The name of his city signified Peace; and as king of peace he typified Christ, the Prince of Peace, the great Reconciler of God and man. Nothing is recorded as to the beginning or end of his life; thus he typically resembled the Son of God, whose existence is from everlasting to everlasting, who had no one that was before him, and will have no one come after him, in his priesthood. Every part of Scripture honours the great King of Righteousness and Peace, our glorious High Priest and Saviour; and the more we examine it, the more we shall be convinced, that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</body></html>
