The following chapter records the martyrdom of seven brethren, who for their adherence to their law were put to death with cruel tortures. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm" title="By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:">Hebrews 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-14.htm" title="For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.">Hebrews 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-23.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.">Hebrews 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-29.htm" title="By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.">Hebrews 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-36.htm" title="And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:">Hebrews 11:36</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Not accepting deliverance.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">not accepting the redemption, i.e., </span>the deliverance offered, which must be purchased at the price of their constancy.<p><span class= "bld">A better resurrection.</span>--Better than that return to the present life which is spoken of in the first words of the verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Women received their dead raised to life again</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from</span>, or, <span class="accented">out of resurrection.</span> The A.V. gives the sense in good English; only the force of the repetition of the word "resurrection" at the end of the verse is lost); <span class="cmt_word">and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</span> The first part of this verse evidently refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-36.htm">2 Kings 4:36</a> - the memorable instances in the Old Testament of mothers having had their sons restored to them from death. The latter part is as evidently suggested at least by the narrative of 2 Macc. 7; where it is recorded how, under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, seven sons of one mother were tortured and put to death; how one of them, in the midst of his tortures, having deliverance and advancement offered him if he would forsake the Law of his fathers, courageously refused the offer; and how both they and their mother, who encouraged them to persevere, reiterated their hope of a resurrection from the dead. The "better resurrection" means the resurrection to eternal life by them looked for, which was "better" than the temporary restoration to life in this world granted to the sons of the widow of Zarephath and the Shunammite; while the article in the Greek before "deliverance" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) may be due to the thought of that which is recorded to have been offered to those in the writer's immediate view. There is some doubt as to the exact import of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "tortured"). The usual meaning of the Greek word is" to beat," as a drum is beaten, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a drum or drumstick: and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to beat to death." But, inasmuch as the instrument of torture to which Eleazar (whose martyrdom is related in the preceding chapter of 2 Maccabees) was brought is called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (6:19, 28), it has been supposed that the punishment referred to was the stretching of the victims, in the way of a rack, on a sort of wheel called a <span class="accented">tympanum</span>, on which they were then beaten to death, as Eleazar was. So Vulgate, <span class="accented">distenti sunt.</span> The fact that the seven of 2 Macc. 7. were not so martyred, but by fire and other tortures, is not inconsistent with this view; for our author need not be supposed to confine his view to them, but uses the word suggested by Eleazar's case. Whatever be the exact import of the word, the A.V. ("were tortured") sufficiently gives the generally intended meaning. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:32-38 After all our searches into the Scriptures, there is more to be learned from them. We should be pleased to think, how great the number of believers was under the Old Testament, and how strong their faith, though the objects of it were not then so fully made known as now. And we should lament that now, in gospel times, when the rule of faith is more clear and perfect, the number of believers should be so small, and their faith so weak. It is the excellence of the grace of faith, that, while it helps men to do great things, like Gideon, it keeps from high and great thoughts of themselves. Faith, like Barak's, has recourse unto God in all dangers and difficulties, and then makes grateful returns to God for all mercies and deliverances. By faith, the servants of God shall overcome even the roaring lion that goeth about seeking whom he may devour. The believer's faith endures to the end, and, in dying, gives him victory over death and all his deadly enemies, like Samson. The grace of God often fixes upon very undeserving and ill-deserving persons, to do great things for them and by them. But the grace of faith, wherever it is, will put men upon acknowledging God in all their ways, as Jephthah. It will make men bold and courageous in a good cause. Few ever met with greater trials, few ever showed more lively faith, than David, and he has left a testimony as to the trials and acts of faith, in the book of Psalms, which has been, and ever will be, of great value to the people of God. Those are likely to grow up to be distinguished for faith, who begin betimes, like Samuel, to exercise it. And faith will enable a man to serve God and his generation, in whatever way he may be employed. The interests and powers of kings and kingdoms, are often opposed to God and his people; but God can easily subdue all that set themselves against him. It is a greater honour and happiness to work righteousness than to work miracles. By faith we have comfort of the promises; and by faith we are prepared to wait for the promises, and in due time to receive them. And though we do not hope to have our dead relatives or friends restored to life in this world, yet faith will support under the loss of them, and direct to the hope of a better resurrection. Shall we be most amazed at the wickedness of human nature, that it is capable of such awful cruelties to fellow-creatures, or at the excellence of Divine grace, that is able to bear up the faithful under such cruelties, and to carry them safely through all? What a difference between God's judgement of a saint, and man's judgment! The world is not worthy of those scorned, persecuted saints, whom their persecutors reckon unworthy to live. They are not worthy of their company, example, counsel, or other benefits. For they know not what a saint is, nor the worth of a saint, nor how to use him; they hate, and drive such away, as they do the offer of Christ and his grace.</body></html>
