(For a similar use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm">1 Corinthians 11:22</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>). Thus is introduced the illustrative review of Old Testament instances, the purpose of which has been explained above. It begins from the beginning, Abel being the first example. But in the Old Testament the account of the creation precedes that first recorded instance; and, therefore, it is in the first place fittingly referred to, the existence of an unseen creative power mentally perceived beyond things visible, being the primary article - the very foundation - of all religious faith (cf. below, ver. 6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-3 Faith always has been the mark of God's servants, from the beginning of the world. Where the principle is planted by the regenerating Spirit of God, it will cause the truth to be received, concerning justification by the sufferings and merits of Christ. And the same things that are the object of our hope, are the object of our faith. It is a firm persuasion and expectation, that God will perform all he has promised to us in Christ. This persuasion gives the soul to enjoy those things now; it gives them a subsistence or reality in the soul, by the first-fruits and foretastes of them. Faith proves to the mind, the reality of things that cannot be seen by the bodily eye. It is a full approval of all God has revealed, as holy, just, and good. This view of faith is explained by many examples of persons in former times, who obtained a good report, or an honourable character in the word of God. Faith was the principle of their holy obedience, remarkable services, and patient sufferings. The Bible gives the most true and exact account of the origin of all things, and we are to believe it, and not to wrest the Scripture account of the creation, because it does not suit with the differing fancies of men. All that we see of the works of creation, were brought into being by the command of God.</body></html>
