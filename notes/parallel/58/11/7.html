(See the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>.) Noah's obedience to the divine warning was an evidence at once of his fear of God and of the faith which gave substance and present reality to "the things not seen as yet."<p><span class= "bld">By the which.</span>--As before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>), the words "through which" are slightly ambiguous, for they may relate either to the ark or to the faith. The latter reference is more probable. His faith, shown in the building of the ark, exposed the unbelief of "the world," which would not listen to his warnings, and thereby incurred the divine condemnation. Our Lord uses "condemn" in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-41.htm" title="The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.">Matthew 12:41-42</a>. By the same faith Noah "became an heir of the righteousness which is <span class= "ital">according to faith.</span>" Noah is the first to receive in Scripture the name "righteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>). See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm" title="Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-20.htm" title="Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.">Ezekiel 14:20</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2Peter 2:5</a>, "Noah, a preacher of righteousness." This righteousness is looked on as an <span class= "ital">inheritance, </span>received by all who manifest the faith. In this place the righteousness is connected with faith, as in the writings of St. Paul, but with a change of figure. It is not looked on as arising out of faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a>), or as resting on the condition of faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Philippians 3:9</a>), or as obtained by means of faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>), but as corresponding with faith, or answering to it. There is no important difference of thought, but the idea of a continuous inheritance answering to continuous faith is very strikingly presented here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="cmt_word">, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> faith) <span class="cmt_word">he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="cmt_word">.</span> The "things not seen as yet" were the divinely predicted events of the Deluge. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> (translated as above in the A.V.) is taken by many commentators as implying <span class="accented">godly</span> fear, a sentiment of piety, with reference to the previous <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>, since the noun <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> seems to have this special sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (see what was said under ver. 7, where the word occurred); so too the adjective, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm">Acts 8:2</a>. Hence the emendation, "moved with godly fear," in the recent "Revised Version." But, inasmuch as the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> has in the New Testament, as elsewhere, only its original import of caution or circumspection, there is no need to suppose here a further meaning (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>, the only other passage in the New Testament where the verb occurs). Ebrard, taking only prudent forethought to be expressed, enlarges on the lesson thus conveyed to the effect that he who acts on simple faith, regardless of the world's opinion or of ridicule, is the one who is truly prudent. And we may add that such prudence legitimately comes in as a motive in the religious life. The antecedent of "which" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), though the ancients generally understand <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, is taken as above by most moderns; the reason being, not only that <span class="accented">faith</span> (see in ver. 4) is the ruling idea of the whole passage, but also that it suits better the expressed results, especially the second, "became heir," etc. For to say that he became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith through the ark, as being the evidence of his faith, or as being the means of his preservation, is less intelligible than to say that through faith he became so. The sense in which Noah "condemned the world" is illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-41.htm">Matthew 12:41, 42</a>, "The men of Nineveh," etc., "The queen of the <span class="accented">South</span>," etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27</a>). His becoming "heir," etc., rests on the view of the fulfillment of primeval promise being transmitted as an inheritance to the faithful. Noah, as he appears in Genesis, was eminently heir in this sense, as alone in his day appropriating it and as transmitting it to his seed. In like manner Abraham, who is next mentioned, was the prominent heir among the subsequent patriarchs (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a>). The idea running through the whole Old Testament is that, in the midst of a sinful world, an inheritance of salvation was transmitted through a chosen seed, till the Christ should come as the "Heir of all things," the perfected Head and Representative of all redeemed humanity. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as that of which Noah was heir, may have been suggested with reference to him by his being the first who is called <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, and by this being his usual designation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>; Ecclus. 44:17; Wisd. 10:4, 6, Sir. 44:17; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). The whole phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, may be taken to imply the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith, which may be supposed to have been familiar to the readers of this Epistle, having been already fully enunciated by St. Paul, and dwelt on by him as especially exemplified in Abraham. St. Paul, indeed, does not use this exact phrase, but <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11, 13</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>); but still the meaning may be the same. The correspondence is an instance of Pauline thought in this Epistle, while the difference of phrase affords a presumption, though by no means in itself conclusive, against Pauline authorship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:4-7 Here follow some illustrious examples of faith from the Old Testament. Abel brought a sacrifice of atonement from the firstlings of the flock, acknowledging himself a sinner who deserved to die, and only hoping for mercy through the great Sacrifice. Cain's proud rage and enmity against the accepted worshipper of God, led to the awful effects the same principles have produced in every age; the cruel persecution, and even murder of believers. By faith Abel, being dead, yet speaketh; he left an instructive and speaking example. Enoch was translated, or removed, that he should not see death; God took him into heaven, as Christ will do the saints who shall be alive at his second coming. We cannot come to God, unless we believe that he is what he has revealed himself to be in the Scripture. Those who would find God, must seek him with all their heart. Noah's faith influenced his practice; it moved him to prepare an ark. His faith condemned the unbelief of others; and his obedience condemned their contempt and rebellion. Good examples either convert sinners or condemn them. This shows how believers, being warned of God to flee from the wrath to come, are moved with fear, take refuge in Christ, and become heirs of the righteousness of faith.</body></html>
