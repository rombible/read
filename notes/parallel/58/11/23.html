The next clause should probably be closely connected with this--"because they saw . . . and were not afraid of the king's commandment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-16.htm" title="And he said, When you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the stools; if it be a son, then you shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.">Exodus 1:16</a>). Their reliance on the protection of God enabled them to brave the anger of the king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw that he was a proper</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the word used of the child in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-2.htm">Exodus 2:2</a>, there translated "goodly," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a>, "fair") <span class="cmt_word">child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</span> Here the usual following of the LXX. again appears in the hiding being attributed to both parents (this is certainly the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, not - as some interpret because of the masculine form - father and grandfather). In the Hebrew it is the mother only that is spoken of as hiding him; whereas in the LXX. the verbs are in the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, etc., though with no expressed nominative. It is not <span class="accented">necessary</span> to understand a special faith in the fulfillment of the promises through the child thus hidden to be implied, though it may be so intended. But the mere fearlessness in obeying the dictates of heart and conscience in the face of danger, and the mere reliance on Providence, thus displayed, expressed faith. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:20-31 Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning things to come. Things present are not the best things; no man knoweth love or hatred by having them or wanting them. Jacob lived by faith, and he died by faith, and in faith. Though the grace of faith is of use always through our whole lives, it is especially so when we come to die. Faith has a great work to do at last, to help the believer to die to the Lord, so as to honour him, by patience, hope, and joy. Joseph was tried by temptations to sin, by persecution for keeping his integrity; and he was tried by honours and power in the court of Pharaoh, yet his faith carried him through. It is a great mercy to be free from wicked laws and edicts; but when we are not so, we must use all lawful means for our security. In this faith of Moses' parents there was a mixture of unbelief, but God was pleased to overlook it. Faith gives strength against the sinful, slavish fear of men; it sets God before the soul, shows the vanity of the creature, and that all must give way to the will and power of God. The pleasures of sin are, and will be, but short; they must end either in speedy repentance or in speedy ruin. The pleasures of this world are for the most part the pleasures of sin; they are always so when we cannot enjoy them without deserting God and his people. Suffering is to be chosen rather than sin; there being more evil in the least sin, than there can be in the greatest suffering. God's people are, and always have been, a reproached people. Christ accounts himself reproached in their reproaches; and thus they become greater riches than the treasures of the richest empire in the world. Moses made his choice when ripe for judgment and enjoyment, able to know what he did, and why he did it. It is needful for persons to be seriously religious; to despise the world, when most capable of relishing and enjoying it. Believers may and ought to have respect to the recompence of reward. By faith we may be fully sure of God's providence, and of his gracious and powerful presence with us. Such a sight of God will enable believers to keep on to the end, whatever they may meet in the way. It is not owing to our own righteousness, or best performances, that we are saved from the wrath of God; but to the blood of Christ, and his imputed righteousness. True faith makes sin bitter to the soul, even while it receives the pardon and atonement. All our spiritual privileges on earth, should quicken us in our way to heaven. The Lord will make even Babylon fall before the faith of his people, and when he has some great thing to do for them, he raises up great and strong faith in them. A true believer is desirous, not only to be in covenant with God, but in communion with the people of God; and is willing to fare as they fare. By her works Rahab declared herself to be just. That she was not justified by her works appears plainly; because the work she did was faulty in the manner, and not perfectly good, therefore it could not be answerable to the perfect justice or righteousness of God.</body></html>
