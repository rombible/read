(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/16-1.htm" title="Now Sarai Abram's wife bore him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.">Genesis 16:1-2</a>.) The words "was delivered of a child" are absent from the best authorities; so that we must read, "even when she was past age." With the last words of the verse compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm" title="Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)">Hebrews 10:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed, even when she was past age</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, as in the Textus Receptus, after <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, may be rejected, being, perhaps, an interpolation suggested by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">because she judged him faithful who had promised. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea-shore innumerable.</span> The vitality of Abraham's faith is represented as evinced by its surviving and triumphing over a succession of trials, over apparent impossibilities. One such peculiar trial was the long delay of the birth of a legitimate heir through whom the promise of an innumerable seed might be fulfilled, and this till it seemed out of the question in the natural course of things. Yet "he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief... being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17-23</a>, which is a fuller statement of the idea of this verse, including the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> to express effeteness, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, corresponding to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span> here. This is a further instance of Pauline thought in this Epistle - ideas already enlarged on by St. Paul being taken for granted as understood.) In Romans Abraham's faith in this regard is treated as typifying Christian faith in the resurrection from the dead (ver. 24), as is also, in the chapter before us (ver. 19), his faith displayed on the occasion of the offering of Isaac. For to us also our inability to conceive the mode of accomplishment of what well-grounded faith assures us of is no just cause for staggering. "How are the dead raised up? and with what kind of body do they come?" was asked by the Corinthian doubters. St. Paul directs them, in reply, to faith in "the power of God" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-24.htm">Mark 12:24</a>) to accomplish his purposes and fulfill his promises in ways unknown to us, transcending, though analogous to, the mysterious processes of nature that we see before our eyes. For "with God all things are possible." Sarah is here joined with Abraham, as also "receiving power" by faith, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her own faith, as the structure of ver. 11 seems evidently to imply. But how is this consistent with the account of her in Genesis, where she is nowhere held up as an example of faith; nay, is censured for incredulity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12-16</a>) with respect to the promise cf. offspring? The answer may be that her temporary unbelief is concluded to have been succeeded by faith, as proved by the result, viz. that she "<span class="accented">received</span> power." And, indeed, her laughter recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, does not seem intended to imply any permanent "heart of unbelief;" for even Abraham had laughed as she did when the same announcement had been previously made to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>), and the "<span class="accented">laughter"</span> associated with her memory has quite a different meaning given it when that of temporary incredulity was changed into that of joy on the birth of the promised son, who was consequently called Isaac (equivalent to "laughter"). It <span class="accented">is</span>, however, Abraham himself who is put prominently before us as the great example of faith; Sarah is only introduced by his side (with the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span>) as sharing it and cooperating to the result. To him singly the writer returns in ver. 12, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:8-19 We are often called to leave worldly connexions, interests, and comforts. If heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall obey and go forth, though not knowing what may befall us; and we shall be found in the way of duty, looking for the performance of God's promises. The trial of Abraham's faith was, that he simply and fully obeyed the call of God. Sarah received the promise as the promise of God; being convinced of that, she truly judged that he both could and would perform it. Many, who have a part in the promises, do not soon receive the things promised. Faith can lay hold of blessings at a great distance; can make them present; can love them and rejoice in them, though strangers; as saints, whose home is heaven; as pilgrims, travelling toward their home. By faith, they overcome the terrors of death, and bid a cheerful farewell to this world, and to all the comforts and crosses of it. And those once truly and savingly called out of a sinful state, have no mind to return into it. All true believers desire the heavenly inheritance; and the stronger faith is, the more fervent those desires will be. Notwithstanding their meanness by nature, their vileness by sin, and the poverty of their outward condition, God is not ashamed to be called the God of all true believers; such is his mercy, such is his love to them. Let them never be ashamed of being called his people, nor of any of those who are truly so, how much soever despised in the world. Above all, let them take care that they are not a shame and reproach to their God. The greatest trial and act of faith upon record is, Abraham's offering up Isaac, Ge 22:2. There, every word shows a trial. It is our duty to reason down our doubts and fears, by looking, as Abraham did, to the Almighty power of God. The best way to enjoy our comforts is, to give them up to God; he will then again give them as shall be the best for us. Let us look how far our faith has caused the like obedience, when we have been called to lesser acts of self-denial, or to make smaller sacrifices to our duty. Have we given up what was called for, fully believing that the Lord would make up all our losses, and even bless us by the most afflicting dispensations?</body></html>
