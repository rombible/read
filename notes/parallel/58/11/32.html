Enough has now been said to guide all who are willing to search the Scriptures for themselves. With a brief mention of names which would call up before the minds of his readers achievements almost as wonderful as those on which he has been dwelling, he passes from the elders who received witness from God by their faith, and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/11-33.htm" title="Who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.">Hebrews 11:33-38</a>) speaks in general terms, but all the more distinctly, of the triumphs which faith has won.<p><span class= "bld">The time would fail me.</span>--The slight changes of text required by our best evidence give increased vividness: <span class= "ital">For the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah.</span> To the exploits of Barak (Judges 4, 5), Gideon (Judges 6-8), Samson (Judges 13-16), Jephthah (Judges 11, 12), there is manifest reference in the words of later verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/11-33.htm" title="Who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.">Hebrews 11:33-34</a>). There seems to be no design in this arrangement of the names. In the following clause also, "of David and Samuel and the prophets," there is a similar departure from the order of time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32-34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak and Samson and Jephthah; and of David and Samuel and the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the months of lions, quenched the power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight</span> (literally, <span class="accented">were made strong in war</span>)<span class="cmt_word">, turned to flight armies of aliens.</span> The names thus mentioned are meant as prominent specimens of the long array of Israel's heroes to the end of the sacred history, though, for the avoidance of prolixity, the list is not continued beyond the foundation of the kingdom under David and Samuel. Among the judges, Gideon is mentioned first, though he came after Barak, probably as being the most famous hero, as well as more remarkable in the history for faith and heroism. "The day of Midian" is referred to by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>) as the memorable triumph of ancient days. Hence (the arrangement of the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the Textus Receptus being retained) Gideon is first mentioned singly, and is succeeded by two groups - viz. Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, representing the period of the judges generally; then David and Samuel, representing that of the kings and prophets. The deeds enumerated in the following verses need not be appropriated exclusively to particular heroes, but may be rather taken as denoting generally the kind of exploits by which faith was evidenced throughout the history. Some, however, seem to have special references, as the stopping of lions' mouths, and quenching the power of fire, to the incidents recorded in the Book of Daniel. "Escaped the edge of the sword," though peculiarly applicable to Elijah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10, 14</a>, "have slain thy prophets with the sword, and I, even I, only am left," etc.), has, of course, many other applications. Some see in "out of weakness were made strong" a special allusion to Samson's recovery of his strength, but it is better taken in general reference to the frequent instances of the weak things of this world being enabled through faith to confound the strong, and the few to prevail against the many. Numerous expressions to this effect in the Psalms, when the psalmist rises out of the depths of humiliation and weakness into confident reliance on Divine aid, will suggest themselves at once; and the instances of Gideon, Jonathan, David, and others, will occur readily to the mind. In the four concluding clauses of ver. 34, Delitzsch supposes the Maccabean heroes to be specifically alluded to - partly because of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> being used here, as it is also frequently in 1 Maccabees, in the sense of "encamped army," instead of its proper and usual one of "camp" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11, 13</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>) This coincidence of usage does add to the probability that the Maccabean history, to which all the expressions are very suitable, was at any rate included in the writer's view. But in the history of Gideon too (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>) the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> for the host encamped; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span>. Allusion to Maccabees is more distinctly evident; in ver. 35, as will be seen. The expression, "obtained promises (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," surely expresses having promises fulfilled to them, not merely having promise made to them. "Promises" being in the plural, and without an article, so as to include all prophetic promises even of a temporal character, such as that to David that he should reign instead of Saul, - there is no need here to reconcile the assertion with that of ver. 39, "received not the promise (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>);" on which expression, however, see below. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:32-38 After all our searches into the Scriptures, there is more to be learned from them. We should be pleased to think, how great the number of believers was under the Old Testament, and how strong their faith, though the objects of it were not then so fully made known as now. And we should lament that now, in gospel times, when the rule of faith is more clear and perfect, the number of believers should be so small, and their faith so weak. It is the excellence of the grace of faith, that, while it helps men to do great things, like Gideon, it keeps from high and great thoughts of themselves. Faith, like Barak's, has recourse unto God in all dangers and difficulties, and then makes grateful returns to God for all mercies and deliverances. By faith, the servants of God shall overcome even the roaring lion that goeth about seeking whom he may devour. The believer's faith endures to the end, and, in dying, gives him victory over death and all his deadly enemies, like Samson. The grace of God often fixes upon very undeserving and ill-deserving persons, to do great things for them and by them. But the grace of faith, wherever it is, will put men upon acknowledging God in all their ways, as Jephthah. It will make men bold and courageous in a good cause. Few ever met with greater trials, few ever showed more lively faith, than David, and he has left a testimony as to the trials and acts of faith, in the book of Psalms, which has been, and ever will be, of great value to the people of God. Those are likely to grow up to be distinguished for faith, who begin betimes, like Samuel, to exercise it. And faith will enable a man to serve God and his generation, in whatever way he may be employed. The interests and powers of kings and kingdoms, are often opposed to God and his people; but God can easily subdue all that set themselves against him. It is a greater honour and happiness to work righteousness than to work miracles. By faith we have comfort of the promises; and by faith we are prepared to wait for the promises, and in due time to receive them. And though we do not hope to have our dead relatives or friends restored to life in this world, yet faith will support under the loss of them, and direct to the hope of a better resurrection. Shall we be most amazed at the wickedness of human nature, that it is capable of such awful cruelties to fellow-creatures, or at the excellence of Divine grace, that is able to bear up the faithful under such cruelties, and to carry them safely through all? What a difference between God's judgement of a saint, and man's judgment! The world is not worthy of those scorned, persecuted saints, whom their persecutors reckon unworthy to live. They are not worthy of their company, example, counsel, or other benefits. For they know not what a saint is, nor the worth of a saint, nor how to use him; they hate, and drive such away, as they do the offer of Christ and his grace.</body></html>
