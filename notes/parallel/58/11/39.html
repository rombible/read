That in such a faith as was described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a> "the elders" received their witness from God, the records themselves have shown; yet "these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the promised blessing. There are three passages of the Epistle which must be kept together--<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-15.htm" title="And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.">Hebrews 6:15</a>, "And so, having patiently waited, he (Abraham) obtained the promise;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm" title="For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.">Hebrews 10:36</a>, "Ye have need of endurance, that having done the will of God ye may receive the promise;" and the present versa. To the saints of the Old Testament the promised blessing was future; they obtained it, but not within the limits of this present life. To us the promised blessing is present, revealed to us in its true nature, obtained for us once for all; for we know that eternal redemption has been won through Christ's entering for us once for all into the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>), and to us the "perfection" has come, in that through Him we "draw near to God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>). That (1) the full personal appropriation of the gift is for every one of us still future, and (2) the full revelation belongs to another state of being, is true, but not inconsistent with what has been said.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers, 39, 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these all, having obtained a good report</span> (literally, <span class="accented">having been witnessed of</span>, as in ver. 2) <span class="cmt_word">through faith, received not the promise: God having provided</span> (or, <span class="accented">foreseen</span>) <span class="cmt_word">some better thing for</span> (literally, <span class="accented">concerning</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</span> There is no contradiction between the assertion here made, that none of the saints of old "received the promise (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) "and its being said of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>) that he did "obtain the promise (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)." For though in both passages "the promise," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the great Messianic promise (not "premises," as in ver. 33, <span class="accented">supra</span>), is spoken of - or at any rate, in the case of Abraham, ultimately referred to - yet the verbs used are different and have different meanings, He "obtained" or attained to it, in the sense of having it confirmed and assured to him and his seed (see note on Hebrews 6:15); but he did not actually get it so as to reduce it to possession and enter into the enjoyment of it. The realization of all that is meant by the word here used is, indeed, even to Christian believers, still future (for cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Nay, it is future also in its fullness, even to the saints at rest; for in the passage just quoted it is plainly intimated that the entire fulfillment will not be till "he that shall come" comes; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till the second advent. The redeemed whose probation on earth is over are indeed, in one sense, said to be already "perfected" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a>); but still the "perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul" is nowhere in the New Testament contemplated till "the end." In the mean time, even the saints under the heavenly altar still cry, "Lord, how long?" and the Spirit and the bride say, "Come, Lord Jesus." The full idea, then, of ver. 40 may be that, according to the eternal Divine purpose, the promise of redemption should not be fully realized till the number of the elect shall be accomplished, and all the redeemed of all ages since the world began shall be gathered together through Christ in one, and God shall be all in all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:39,40 The world considers that the righteous are not worthy to live in the world, and God declares the world is not worthy of them. Though the righteous and the worldlings widely differ in their judgment, they agree in this, it is not fit that good men should have their rest in this world. Therefore God receives them out of it. The apostle tells the Hebrews, that God had provided some better things for them, therefore they might be sure that he expected as good things from them. As our advantages, with the better things God has provided for us, are so much beyond theirs, so should our obedience of faith, patience of hope, and labour of love, be greater. And unless we get true faith as these believers had, they will rise up to condemn us at the last day. Let us then pray continually for the increase of our faith, that we may follow these bright examples, and be, with them, at length made perfect in holiness and happiness, and shine like the sun in the kingdom of our Father for evermore.</body></html>
