Hence, apart from the first words, "by faith," there is nothing here said to explain the superiority of Abel's offering; though one who believes sacrifice to have been of Divine institution, and who notes the close connection between God's word and the actions of the men whose faith is here recorded, may hold it probable that Abel's obedience was manifested in his mode of approaching God.<p><span class= "bld">By which he obtained witness.</span>--Probably, "through which <span class= "ital">faith," </span>but the Greek may also mean <span class= "ital">through which sacrifice.</span> The witness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-2.htm" title="For by it the elders obtained a good report.">Hebrews 11:2</a>) is that borne by God in His acceptance of the offering (shown by some visible sign); we might also add that such a testimony to Abel is implied in the reproof of Cain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-7.htm" title="If you do well, shall you not be accepted? and if you do not well, sin lies at the door. And to you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him.">Genesis 4:7</a>), but the following words, "God bearing witness over" (or <span class= "ital">in regard to</span>)<span class= "ital"> "</span>his gifts," show what was chiefly in the writer's thought. Such acceptance implied Abel's righteousness and thus testified to his "faith." It is remarkable that in three out of the four places in which Abel is mentioned in the New Testament this epithet is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.">1John 3:12</a>). In the later Jewish tradition (contained in the Targum of Jerusalem) the brothers are represented as types of faith and unbelief; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm" title="For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.">Hebrews 11:10</a>, "thy brother's blood" (Hebrew, "bloods") is expanded into "the blood of the multitude of the righteous who were to arise from thy brother." In this clause the authorities for the Greek text are much divided. One reading, "he testifying over his gifts to God," has the support of the three oldest MSS., but can hardly be correct.<p><span class= "bld">And by it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and through it</span> (his faith). The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm" title="And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.">Genesis 4:10</a>, "the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>); hence, as Calvin remarks, "he was plainly numbered among God's saints, whose death is precious in His sight."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. faith</span>, not <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, "faith" being the ruling idea of the whole passage) <span class="cmt_word">he obtained witness</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was witnessed of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that he was righteous, God testifying of</span> (literally, <span class="accented">witnessing upon</span>, or, <span class="accented">in respect to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his gifts: and through it</span> (<span class="accented">faith<span class="cmt_word"></span>) he being dead yet speaketh.</span> In the traditions preserved in Genesis of the dim and distant antediluvian period, three figures stand out prominently as representing the righteous seed in the midst of growing evil - Abel, Enoch, and Noah. These are, therefore, first adduced with the view of showing that it is in respect of faith that they are thus distinguished in the sacred record. With respect to Abel, it is not necessary to inquire or conjecture whether the bloody character of his offering is to be considered as constituting its superior excellence. The record in Genesis simply represents the two brothers as offering each what he had to offer in accordance with his occupation and pursuits, the only difference being that Abel is said to, have offered <span class="accented">his firstlings</span> and the fat thereof, while nothing is said of Cain having brought his first fruits or his best. Then, in the account of the result, we are only told that unto one the LORD had respect, and not to the other, without mention of the reason why. It is usual to find a reason in the nature of Abel's offering as signifying atonement, and to suppose his faith manifested in his recognition of the need of such atonement, signified to him, as has been further supposed, by Divine command. This view of the intention of the narrative is indeed suggested by the description of what his offering was, viewed in the light of subsequent sacrificial theory; but it is not apparent in the narrative taken by itself, or in the reference to it in the passage before us. The acceptableness of the offering is here simply attributed, as of necessity, to the faith of the offerer, without any intimation of how that faith had been evinced. And with this view of the matter agrees the record itself, where it is said that "unto Abel and his offering the LORD had respect;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Abel first, and then to his offering - the offering was accepted because Abel was, not Abel on account of his kind of offering. "Crone quod datur Deo ex dantis mente pensatur... Neque enim sacrum eloquimn dicit, Respexit ad munera Abel et ad Cain mqnera non respexit, sed prius air quid respexit ad Abel, ac deinde subjunxit, 'et ad munera ejus.' Idcirco non Abel ex muneribus, sed ex Abel munera oblata placuerunt" (St. Gregory, quoted by Delitzsch). "And he being dead," etc., refers plainly to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground." The same voice of innocent blood, which appealed at the beginning of human history to the God of righteousness, cries still through all the ages; it sounds in our own cars now, telling us that faith prevails on high, and that "right dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints." Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a> for an allusion again to the cry of the blood of Abel. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is there also used, supporting the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, rather than the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the Textus Receptus here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:4-7 Here follow some illustrious examples of faith from the Old Testament. Abel brought a sacrifice of atonement from the firstlings of the flock, acknowledging himself a sinner who deserved to die, and only hoping for mercy through the great Sacrifice. Cain's proud rage and enmity against the accepted worshipper of God, led to the awful effects the same principles have produced in every age; the cruel persecution, and even murder of believers. By faith Abel, being dead, yet speaketh; he left an instructive and speaking example. Enoch was translated, or removed, that he should not see death; God took him into heaven, as Christ will do the saints who shall be alive at his second coming. We cannot come to God, unless we believe that he is what he has revealed himself to be in the Scripture. Those who would find God, must seek him with all their heart. Noah's faith influenced his practice; it moved him to prepare an ark. His faith condemned the unbelief of others; and his obedience condemned their contempt and rebellion. Good examples either convert sinners or condemn them. This shows how believers, being warned of God to flee from the wrath to come, are moved with fear, take refuge in Christ, and become heirs of the righteousness of faith.</body></html>
