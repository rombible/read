The word "image" is indeed consistent with the very closest and most perfect likeness; but why is the contrast to "shadow" expressed by a word which cannot denote more than likeness, and not by a reference to the things themselves? The answer would seem to be that, from the very nature of the "good things to come," the law could not be conceived of as having the things themselves; but had it possessed "the very image" of them, a representation so perfect might have been found to bring with it equal efficacy.<p><span class= "bld">Can never with those sacrifices.</span>--It is difficult to ascertain the exact Greek text in the latter half of this verse. With the ordinary reading the general construction of the sentence is that which the Authorised version represents, "For the law . . . can never . . . make perfect." The better MSS., however, read "they can," a change which introduces some irregularity of construction: the pronoun "they" must probably in this case be understood of the priests. The order of the Greek is also very peculiar. Two translations of the verse (with the changed reading) may be given: (1) "They can never with the same sacrifices year by year which they offer continually make them that draw nigh perfect." (2) "They can never year by year, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually, make them that draw nigh perfect." The difference between the two renderings will be easily seen. The former makes the whole sentence to relate to the annual sacrifice on the Day of Atonement, and gives to "continually" almost the same meaning as "year by year." The meaning of the latter is that by the annual sacrifices, which are the same as those which the priests are offering for the people day by day (for the sacrifice of the Day of Atonement did not <span class= "ital">in itself</span> differ from the ordinary sin offering), they cannot make the worshippers perfect. The latter translation agrees best with the original, and conveys a very striking thought. <span class= "ital">It</span> is open, however, to a very serious objection--that it separates the verse into two incongruous parts. That annual sacrifices not different in kind from the sin offerings which were presented day by day (and which the very institution of the Day of Atonement declared to be imperfect) could not bring to the worshippers what they needed, is an important argument; but it has no connection with the first words of the verse. Hence, though the Greek does not very readily yield the former translation, it is probably to be preferred.

But when God manifested in the flesh, became the sacrifice, and his death upon the accursed tree the ransom, then the Sufferer being of infinite worth, his free-will sufferings were of infinite value. The atoning sacrifice must be one capable of consenting, and must of his own will place himself in the sinner's stead: Christ did so. The fountain of all that Christ has done for his people, is the sovereign will and grace of God. The righteousness brought in, and the sacrifice once offered by Christ, are of eternal power, and his salvation shall never be done away. They are of power to make all the comers thereunto perfect; they derive from the atoning blood, strength and motives for obedience, and inward comfort.</body></html>
