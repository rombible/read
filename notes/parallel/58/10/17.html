The words "after He hath said before" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-15.htm" title="Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,">Hebrews 10:15</a>) imply "then He saith," or similar words, at some point in the verses which follow. Our translators did not attempt to complete the sense; for the marginal note ("some copies have, <span class= "ital">Then he saith, And their"</span>) found in ordinary editions was added at a later date.<span class= "note">[12]</span> By many commentators it is believed that the words "saith the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-16.htm" title="This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, said the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;">Hebrews 10:16</a>) are intended as the completion of the sentence, so that no supplement is needed. This is, we think, very improbable. As it is the last part of the quotation that is taken up here, it is at the beginning of this verse that the explanatory words must come in: "<span class= "ital">Then He saith, </span>And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." This we have seen to be the crowning promise of the new covenant of which Jesus is the Mediator. When these words were first quoted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-12.htm" title="For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.">Hebrews 8:12</a>), some important points in the argument were still untouched. Now the firm basis of the promise has been shown, for the covenant has been ratified by the death of Christ, and the blessings He has won for men are eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><span class= "note">[12] From Dr. Scrivener's "Cambridge Paragraph Bible<span class= "ital">"</span> (p. xxxii.) we learn that the note was added by Dr. Paris in the Cambridge Bible of 1762. Dr. Scrivener adds: "probably from the Philoxenian Syriac version, then just becoming know."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:11-18 Under the new covenant, or gospel dispensation, full and final pardon is to be had. This makes a vast difference between the new covenant and the old one. Under the old, sacrifices must be often repeated, and after all, only pardon as to this world was to be obtained by them. Under the new, one Sacrifice is enough to procure for all nations and ages, spiritual pardon, or being freed from punishment in the world to come. Well might this be called a new covenant. Let none suppose that human inventions can avail those who put them in the place of the sacrifice of the Son of God. What then remains, but that we seek an interest in this Sacrifice by faith; and the seal of it to our souls, by the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience? So that by the law being written in our hearts, we may know that we are justified, and that God will no more remember our sins.</body></html>
