Elsewhere we read of "the day of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>); "the day of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-10.htm" title="That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ.">Philippians 1:10</a>). The words of Jesus to His disciples (Matthew 24; Luke 17) had enabled all who were willing to hear to understand "the signs of the times." As the writer gave these warnings, the day when the Son of Man should come in His kingdom, bringing judgment upon Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.">Matthew 16:28</a>), was close at hand--that day which is distinctly presented to us in the New Testament as the type of His final coming.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:19-25 The apostle having closed the first part of the epistle, the doctrine is applied to practical purposes. As believers had an open way to the presence of God, it became them to use this privilege. The way and means by which Christians enjoy such privileges, is by the blood of Jesus, by the merit of that blood which he offered up as an atoning sacrifice. The agreement of infinite holiness with pardoning mercy, was not clearly understood till the human nature of Christ, the Son of God, was wounded and bruised for our sins. Our way to heaven is by a crucified Saviour; his death is to us the way of life, and to those who believe this, he will be precious. They must draw near to God; it would be contempt of Christ, still to keep at a distance. Their bodies were to be washed with pure water, alluding to the cleansings directed under the law: thus the use of water in baptism, was to remind Christians that their conduct should be pure and holy. While they derived comfort and grace from their reconciled Father to their own souls, they would adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Believers are to consider how they can be of service to each other, especially stirring up each other to the more vigorous and abundant exercise of love, and the practice of good works. The communion of saints is a great help and privilege, and a means of stedfastness and perseverance. We should observe the coming of times of trial, and be thereby quickened to greater diligence. There is a trying day coming on all men, the day of our death.</body></html>
