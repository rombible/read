The apodosis to "after that he hath said," not distinctly marked in the Greek or in the A.V., is denoted in the above rendering by "<span class="accented">then saith he"</span> before ver. 17. Another view is that it begins earlier in the sentence, being introduced by "saith the Lord," which occurs in the quotation from Jeremiah. But this is improbable, since <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> words in the quotation itself could not well be intended to be understood as the quoter's own; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the quotation down to ver. 17 is continuous, whereas the citation of ver. 17 is in the original passage of Jeremiah separated from the preceding one; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the logical conclusion intended to be drawn requires ver. 17 to be the apodosis. For the writer's purpose in referring once more to Jeremiah's prediction of the" new covenant" is to show from it the completeness and finality of Christ's atonement; and this, he argues, follows from this characteristic of the "new covenant" being added to the previous description of it - "Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." CH. 10:19-END. HORTATORY PORTION OF THE EPISTLE. The great doctrine of Christ's eternal priesthood having been led up to, established by argument, and at length fully expounded, it remains only to press the practical result of a belief in it in alternate tones of encouragement and of warning. We have seen that, even in the earlier chapters, hortatory passages were frequently interposed, showing the purpose all along in the writer's mind. In the central and deepest part of the argument (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1-10:19</a>) there were none, close and uninterrupted attention to the course of thought being then demanded. But now, the argument being completed, the previous exhortations are taken up again, and enforced in consequently fuller and deeper tones. The connection of thought between these final admonitions and those previously interposed is evident when we compare the very expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-23</a> with those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>, and the warnings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc., with those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc. Thus appears, as in other ways also, the carefully arranged plan of the Epistle, different in this respect from the undoubted Epistles of St. Paul, in which the thoughts generally follow each other without great regard to artistic arrangement. This, however, is in itself by no means conclusive against St. Paul's authorship, since there would be likely to be just this difference between a set treatise composed for a purpose, and a letter written <span class="accented">currente calamo</span> by the same author. It does, however, mark a different class of composition, and is suggestive, as far as it goes, of a different writer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:11-18 Under the new covenant, or gospel dispensation, full and final pardon is to be had. This makes a vast difference between the new covenant and the old one. Under the old, sacrifices must be often repeated, and after all, only pardon as to this world was to be obtained by them. Under the new, one Sacrifice is enough to procure for all nations and ages, spiritual pardon, or being freed from punishment in the world to come. Well might this be called a new covenant. Let none suppose that human inventions can avail those who put them in the place of the sacrifice of the Son of God. What then remains, but that we seek an interest in this Sacrifice by faith; and the seal of it to our souls, by the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience? So that by the law being written in our hearts, we may know that we are justified, and that God will no more remember our sins.</body></html>
