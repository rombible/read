The true reading is "of the hope" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm" title="And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:">Hebrews 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-18.htm" title="That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us:">Hebrews 6:18-19</a>). The two following words must be joined with "confession," "let us hold fast the confession of the (Christian) hope so that it waver not." This hope "maketh not ashamed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>), for the promise is sure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us hold fast the confession</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>, and ref.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>) of our hope without wavering (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;</span>, agreeing with "confession"); <span class="cmt_word">for he is faithful that promised: and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</span> The readers, having been exhorted to confidence towards God, are further warned against remissness in confession before men, or in their duties within the Church towards each other. They had once, at their baptism, "confessed the good confession" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>). Let not the recurrence of Jewish prejudices, or either influence or persecution from their Jewish compatriots, or any delay of the <span class="accented">Parousia</span>, induce them to waver in maintaining it. Some among them did, it could not be denied, show signs of such wavering, notably in their remiss attendance at Christian worship; let the faithful give heed to keeping faith alive in themselves and others, and especially through the means of the regular Church assemblies. That by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> is meant definitely the actual assembling together of Christians for reading, exhortation, and worship (such as is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>, etc.,; and described by Justin Martyr, 'Apol., c. 87), we hold confidently with the majority of commentators and with Chrysostom. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>, where it denotes the gathering together at the <span class="accented">Parousia.</span> In 2 Macc. 2:7, where alone it occurs in the LXX., it expresses the actual assembling of people together, as does the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>, both in the LXX. and the New Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-27.htm">Mark 13:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-33.htm">Mark 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>). Hence, and in regard to the context as well as the etymology of the word, we may reject the less definite meaning, by some here assigned to it, of <span class="accented">Christian communion</span> (<span class="accented">conjugatio fidelium</span>), and the explanation of Bengel: "Sensus est, non modo debetis synagogam frequentare, ut Judaei, quod libentius facitis, sed etiam episynagogam, ut Christiani. Neque tamen innuitur praecise aggregatio ad unum locum, aut aggregatio ad unam <span class="accented">fidem</span>; sed, medio sensu, congregatio mutua <span class="accented">per amorem</span> et communicatio publica et privata officiorum Christianorum." The seen approach of the second advent (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>) is adduced as an additional argument against remissness. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> seems to imply more than the general belief in its imminence, founded on the language of Christ. It would seem as if the signs of the times were interpreted as denoting its approach (el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>). And it may be that they were rightly so interpreted in reference to the primary fulfillment of our Savior's words, though to that only, as the event proved. The blending together in the discourses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17.htm">Luke 17</a>. and 21, of the times of the fall of Jerusalem and of the final day, would naturally lead Christians to regard the signs of the first event as denoting the other also. And indeed the imminence of the first, of which the signs were really apparent, was in itself a peculiar reason why the Hebrew Christians should stick resolutely to Christianity, for its own sake and apart from Judaism. Else might their whole hold on Christ be loosened in the temple's fall Thus, though the writer might share in the mistaken view then prevalent of the imminence of the final day, his warning, founded on the supposed signs of it, hits well the peculiar needs of his readers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:19-25 The apostle having closed the first part of the epistle, the doctrine is applied to practical purposes. As believers had an open way to the presence of God, it became them to use this privilege. The way and means by which Christians enjoy such privileges, is by the blood of Jesus, by the merit of that blood which he offered up as an atoning sacrifice. The agreement of infinite holiness with pardoning mercy, was not clearly understood till the human nature of Christ, the Son of God, was wounded and bruised for our sins. Our way to heaven is by a crucified Saviour; his death is to us the way of life, and to those who believe this, he will be precious. They must draw near to God; it would be contempt of Christ, still to keep at a distance. Their bodies were to be washed with pure water, alluding to the cleansings directed under the law: thus the use of water in baptism, was to remind Christians that their conduct should be pure and holy. While they derived comfort and grace from their reconciled Father to their own souls, they would adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Believers are to consider how they can be of service to each other, especially stirring up each other to the more vigorous and abundant exercise of love, and the practice of good works. The communion of saints is a great help and privilege, and a means of stedfastness and perseverance. We should observe the coming of times of trial, and be thereby quickened to greater diligence. There is a trying day coming on all men, the day of our death.</body></html>
