The Greek translation varies a little in different MSS.: "If one draw back, my soul hath no pleasure in him; but the righteous one shall live by my faithfulness" (or <span class= "ital">possibly</span>--not probably--"by faith in me"). In the Alexandrian MSS, the last words run thus: "But my righteous one shall live by faith" (or <span class= "ital">faithfulness</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It is clear, then, that in the passage before us the writer has taken the words as they stood in his text of the LXX., only changing the order of the clauses. Though the Hebrew word usually rendered faith in this passage occurs more than forty times in the Old Testament, in no other case has it this meaning, but almost always signifies faithfulness or truth. Here also the first meaning seems to be "by his faithfulness"; but the thought of faithful constancy to God is inseparably connected with trustful clinging to Him. Hence the accepted Jewish exposition of the passage seems to have taken the word in the sense of "faith." "My righteous one" will naturally mean "my righteous servant"--the man who will not be seduced into wickedness; he shall live by his faithful trust, for salvation and life shall be given him by God Himself. In this context the word righteous recalls-verse 36, "having done the will of God."<p>The transposition of the two clauses makes it almost certain that the "righteous one" is the subject of both: not <span class= "ital">if any man, </span>but, <span class= "ital">if he</span> (the righteous one) <span class= "ital">shrink back.</span> The Genevan and the Authorised stand alone amongst English versions in the former rendering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:32-39 Many and various afflictions united against the early Christians, and they had a great conflict. The Christian spirit is not a selfish spirit; it puts us upon pitying others, visiting them, helping them, and pleading for them. All things here are but shadows. The happiness of the saints in heaven will last for ever; enemies can never take it away as earthly goods. This will make rich amends for all we may lose and suffer here. The greatest part of the saints' happiness, as yet, is in promise. It is a trial of the patience of Christians, to be content to live after their work is done, and to stay for their reward till God's time to give it is come. He will soon come to them at death, to end all their sufferings, and to give them a crown of life. The Christian's present conflict may be sharp, but will be soon over. God never is pleased with the formal profession and outward duties and services of such as do not persevere; but he beholds them with great displeasure. And those who have been kept faithful in great trails for the time past, have reason to hope for the same grace to help them still to live by faith, till they receive the end of their faith and patience, even the salvation of their souls. Living by faith, and dying in faith, our souls are safe for ever.</body></html>
