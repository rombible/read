But as when he entered within the veil the whole people symbolically entered in with him, so do we enter with our High Priest, who "by means of His own blood" entered for us (and as our "Forerunner," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>) into the immediate presence of God.

The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("new") applied to the "way" dedicated for us by Christ, though meaning originally, according to its etymology, "newly slain," is commonly used to express "recent" only. And so here. It is a new way in relation to the old one of the high priest through the veil - a way untrodden by man till opened and dedicated by "the <span class="accented">great</span> Priest." The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> ("living") applied to the way distinguishes it, as a spiritual mode of approach, from the old one. "Opponitur <span class="accented">exanimo.</span> Per prosopopoeiam <span class="accented">vita</span> adscribitur <span class="accented">viae</span>, ex ipsa <span class="accented">vita</span> Christi, qui est <span class="accented">Via"</span> (Bengel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). But what is the meaning of the <span class="accented">veil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the word always used of the veil in the tabernacle or temple) being said to be "his flesh "? The idea cannot be simply that he passed through the human nature assumed at his incarnation to the heavenly throne; for the intended counterpart to the high priest's passing through the veil must have been after the completed sacrifice. It is rather that, at the moment of death, when, after saying, "It is finished," he "gave up the ghost," the human flesh (which had through all the ages been as a veil hiding "<span class="accented">the</span> unseen" from man, and behind which Christ himself had "<span class="accented">tabernacled"</span> during his human life) was, as it were, rent asunder and the new way opened. And that this was so was signified by the rending in twain of the veil of the temple from the top to the bottom, mentioned by St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-51.htm">Matthew 26:51</a>), at the very moment of the death upon the cross. This incident may have suggested to the writer the expression used. "<span class="accented">Quum</span> primum Christus per momentum mortis transierat, praesto fuit mera <span class="accented">virtus</span> et <span class="accented">vita.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">carnem suam</span>, quae item scissa est, ut velum" (Bengel). "The house of God" in ver. 21 is a resumption of the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-7</a>, where Christ was shown to be greater than Moses, as being the SON <span class="accented">over</span> the house of God, having (be it observed) been called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 1. (For the comprehensive meaning of the expression, not limited either to the Mosaic dispensation or the visible Church, see what was said under Hebrews 3:4.) On the now firmly grounded doctrinal bases of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> open access through Christ to the mercy-seat, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his ever-availing intercession, are built the exhortations <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to confidence, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to persistence in faith and corresponding conduct. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:19-25 The apostle having closed the first part of the epistle, the doctrine is applied to practical purposes. As believers had an open way to the presence of God, it became them to use this privilege. The way and means by which Christians enjoy such privileges, is by the blood of Jesus, by the merit of that blood which he offered up as an atoning sacrifice. The agreement of infinite holiness with pardoning mercy, was not clearly understood till the human nature of Christ, the Son of God, was wounded and bruised for our sins. Our way to heaven is by a crucified Saviour; his death is to us the way of life, and to those who believe this, he will be precious. They must draw near to God; it would be contempt of Christ, still to keep at a distance. Their bodies were to be washed with pure water, alluding to the cleansings directed under the law: thus the use of water in baptism, was to remind Christians that their conduct should be pure and holy. While they derived comfort and grace from their reconciled Father to their own souls, they would adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Believers are to consider how they can be of service to each other, especially stirring up each other to the more vigorous and abundant exercise of love, and the practice of good works. The communion of saints is a great help and privilege, and a means of stedfastness and perseverance. We should observe the coming of times of trial, and be thereby quickened to greater diligence. There is a trying day coming on all men, the day of our death.</body></html>
