The subject of this passage, from which the one expressive phrase is taken, is the coming of Jehovah "to punish the inhabitants of the <span class= "bld">And he that shall come will come.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">He that cometh will come and will not tarry.</span> In this and the next verse the writer of the Epistle takes up a passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/2-3.htm" title="For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.">Habakkuk 2:3-4</a>, which occupies a very important place in the writings of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>), and, as we have already seen (Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>), in the later Jewish teaching. St. Paul's citations are limited to a few words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-4.htm" title="For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.">Hebrews 10:4</a>, "But the just shall live by faith;" here are quoted the whole of the fourth verse and part of the third. Perhaps it is too much to say that they are <span class= "ital">quoted, </span>they are rather applied, for, as will be seen, the order of the clauses (see next verse) is changed, and some alterations are made in the language. It is important in this Epistle to discriminate between the instances of direct quotation from the Scripture, where the word of God is appealed to as furnishing proof, and those in which passages of the Old Testament are explained and applied (see the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>). The words before us nearly agree with the LXX., "If he delay, wait for him, because coming he will come, and will not tarry." The subject of the sentence there is not clear; probably the translator believed that the Lord spoke thus of His own coming, or the coming of the future Deliverer. In the Hebrew all relates to the vision, "it will surely come, it will not tarry." The only difference between the LXX. and the words as they stand here consists in the substitution of "He that cometh" for "coming." Now the reference to the Deliverer and Judge is made plain. No designation of the Messiah, perhaps, was more familiar than "He that cometh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-3.htm" title="And said to him, Are you he that should come, or do we look for another?">Matthew 11:3</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>); but in is here employed with a new reference--to the second advent in place of the first. The departure from the sense of the Hebrew is not as great as may at first appear. When the prophet says "The <span class= "ital">vision</span> . . . shall surely come," it is of that which the vision revealed that he speaks, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the fall of the Chaldeans; but the salvation of Israel from present danger is throughout the prophets the symbol of the great deliverance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-26.htm" title="Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.">Hebrews 12:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;">Haggai 2:6</a>). With this verse comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm" title="Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.">Hebrews 10:25</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-5.htm" title="Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.">Philippians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-8.htm" title="Be you also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws near.">James 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm" title="But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch to prayer.">1Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-3.htm" title="Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.">Revelation 22:20</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>; and, in regard to the application of the prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-27.htm" title="But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.">Hebrews 10:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37, 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For yet a little</span> (rather, <span class="accented">very little</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>while, and he that cometh will come, and will not tarry. But the just shall live by faith: and if he draw back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</span> In these verses, after the manner of the Epistle, what is being urged is supported by an Old Testament quotation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3, 4</a>), its drift being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the certainty, notwithstanding delay, of the fulfillment of the Divine promise; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the necessity meanwhile of continuance in faith and perseverance. The quotation serves also as a step of transition (this, too, after the Epistle's manner) to the disquisition on <span class="accented">faith</span>, which forms the subject of the following chapter. For the prophet speaks of <span class="accented">faith</span> as what the righteous one is to live by until the Lord come. It was <span class="accented">faith -</span> a fuller faith - that the Hebrew Christians wanted to preserve them from the faltering of which they showed some signs; and the requirement of <span class="accented">faith</span> was no new thing - it had been the essential principle of all true religious life from the beginning, and thus is led up to the review which follows of the Old Testament history, showing that this had always been so. The quotation, as usual, is from the LXX., which, in this case as in some others, differs from the Hebrew. But here, as in ver. 29, <span class="accented">supra</span>, the LXX. is not exactly followed. The writer cites freely, so as to apply the essential meaning of the passage to his purpose. The Prophet Habakkuk (writing probably during the long evil days of Manasseh) had in his immediate view the trials of faith peculiar to his own time - violence and iniquity in Israel, and imminence of judgment at the hands of Chaldean conquerors, under which he had cried, "O Lord, how long?" But he stands upon his watch and sits upon his tower, to look out what the LORD will say to him in answer to his difficulties. And the LORD answered him, and said, "<span class="accented">Write</span> the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie [rather, 'but it hasteth to the end, and doth not lie']: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, and not tarry [or, 'be behindhand']. Behold, his soul that is lifted up is not upright in him [or, 'behold, his soul is lifted up, it is not upright in him']; but the just shall live by his faith." The drift of this Divine answer, which inspired the song of joyful confidence with which the Book of Habakkuk so beautifully concludes, is, as aforesaid, that, in spite of all appearances, the prophetic vision will ere long be realized; God's promises to the righteous will certainly be fulfilled; and that faith meanwhile must be their sustaining principle.

The variations in the Epistle from the LXX. are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>), interpolated at the beginning of the quotation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f49;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, so as to denote more distinctly the Messiah who was to come (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>); here, of course, with a view to his second advent; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the reversal of the order of the two concluding clauses, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> in the Textus Receptus the omission of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> after either <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (as the same text is cited by St. Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>). There is, however, good authority for reading it here after <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (equivalent to "my Righteous One"). None of these variations from the LXX. affect the meaning of the passage, being only such as to point more clearly the intended application. One of the variations of the LXX. from the Hebrew (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc.) does alter the meaning of that particular clause, though not the general purport of the whole passage. The adoption here of the LXX. reading, and still more the fact that the following verse depends upon this reading, is among the strong evidences of the Epistle having been originally written, not in Hebrew, but in Greek. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:32-39 Many and various afflictions united against the early Christians, and they had a great conflict. The Christian spirit is not a selfish spirit; it puts us upon pitying others, visiting them, helping them, and pleading for them. All things here are but shadows. The happiness of the saints in heaven will last for ever; enemies can never take it away as earthly goods. This will make rich amends for all we may lose and suffer here. The greatest part of the saints' happiness, as yet, is in promise. It is a trial of the patience of Christians, to be content to live after their work is done, and to stay for their reward till God's time to give it is come. He will soon come to them at death, to end all their sufferings, and to give them a crown of life. The Christian's present conflict may be sharp, but will be soon over. God never is pleased with the formal profession and outward duties and services of such as do not persevere; but he beholds them with great displeasure. And those who have been kept faithful in great trails for the time past, have reason to hope for the same grace to help them still to live by faith, till they receive the end of their faith and patience, even the salvation of their souls. Living by faith, and dying in faith, our souls are safe for ever.</body></html>
