Even more clearly than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-4.htm" title="For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> the state described is one of wilful and continued sin, which is the result and the expression of apostasy from Christ. It is not, "If we fall under temptation and commit sin;" but, "If we are sinning wilfully." The descriptive words are few as compared with those of the former passage, but they teach the same lesson. Not merely the "knowledge" but the "full knowledge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>) of the truth has been received by those to whom the writer here makes reference; they have been "sanctified in the blood of the covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>). For such "there remaineth no longer a sacrifice for sins:" that offering of Jesus which they deliberately reject has abolished all the earlier sacrifices. The observances and ceremonies of Judaism, which had been full of meaning whilst they pointed to Him that was to come, have lost all their virtue through His coming. Nay more: for such sin as this, the sin of knowing and wilful rejection of the only Sin offering, God has provided no other sacrifice. In its general significance this passage does not differ from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-4.htm" title="For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>.

Both have been similarly misapplied (see notes on Hebrews 6:4-9); but both have the same real meaning, which is further confirmed by comparing them together. The purport of both is the hopelessness of a state of apostasy from the faith after full knowledge and full enjoyment of privilege; both are led up to by cautions against remissness, of which the final issue <span class="accented">might</span> be such apostasy; both are followed by the expression of a confident hope, founded on past faithfulness, that no such apostasy will really follow. The state contemplated is here expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, a phrase which in itself might at first sight seem to support one of the erroneous views of the drift of the passage, viz. that all willful sin after baptism or grace received is unpardonable. But it is first to be observed that the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is not aorist, but present, expressing a persistent habit; also that the whole context is sufficient to denote the kind of sin intended. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the preceding verses have pointed to laxity of allegiance to Christ, which might have further consequences; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the illustration of what is meant, adduced in ver. 28 from the Mosaic Law, is (as will appear under that verse) a case of entire apostasy - a sin not to be atoned for by any sacrifice, but visited by "cutting off;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the description in ver. 29 of the sin intended implies total repudiation of Christ. Observe, on <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, the contrast to <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>, <span class="accented">al.</span>), expressive of sins of ignorance or infirmity. Not such sins, but deliberate sin with a high hand, is here intended; and further, for the reasons above given, one of this nature so heinous as to be beyond the reach of sacrifice. From all such considerations it appears that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> here expresses the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm">Hebrews 6:6</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>), viz. final obdurate defection from the faith. Further, the previous conditions for the possibility of arriving at such a hopeless state, set forth more at length in vers. 4, 5 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, are here shortly expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which is to be interpreted in the light of the other passage (see note thereon). The consequences of such falling away are differently stated in the two passages. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, it was the impossibility of renewal unto repentance; here it is the absence of any further atoning sacrifice; and this in keeping with what has been now proved of the sacrifice of Christ having superseded all others and been "once for all." The drift is that, if this is deliberately rejected after full knowledge of it, no ether is left to have recourse to. Then the immediate mention of "judgment" is in keeping also with the conclusion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9.htm">Hebrews 9</a>. (see note on Hebrews 9:27), and is immediately suggested here by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 25. The <span class="accented">fire</span> in which that day is to be revealed is a prominent figure both in the Old Testament and the New; regarded as both an <span class="accented">assaying</span> and a <span class="accented">consuming</span> fire (cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13-16</a>). The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("zeal, or indignation, of fire"), not only expresses the vehemence of the flame, but also implies the idea of the fire itself being instinct with the Divine wrath or jealousy (as <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, is usually translated when attributed to God), of which it is the symbol (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-19.htm">Ezekiel 38:19</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: and <span class="accented">infra, Hebrews</span> 12:29, "Our God is a consuming fire").

The sin here mentioned is a total and final falling away, when men, with a full and fixed will and resolution, despise and reject Christ, the only Saviour; despise and resist the Spirit, the only Sanctifier; and despise and renounce the gospel, the only way of salvation, and the words of eternal life. Of this destruction God gives some notorious sinners, while on earth, a fearful foreboding in their consciences, with despair of being able to endure or to escape it. But what punishment can be sorer than to die without mercy? We answer, to die by mercy, by the mercy and grace which they have despised. How dreadful is the case, when not only the justice of God, but his abused grace and mercy call for vengeance! All this does not in the least mean that any souls who sorrow for sin will be shut out from mercy, or that any will be refused the benefit of Christ's sacrifice, who are willing to accept these blessings. Him that cometh unto Christ, he will in no wise cast out.</body></html>
