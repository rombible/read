The change of reading is very important in connection] with the question of authorship. (See the <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">And took joyfully.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and accepted with joy the spoiling of your possessions.</span> In the spirit of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm" title="Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.">Matthew 5:12</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.">2Corinthians 12:10</a>), they accepted persecution not with "patience and long suffering" only, but "with joy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm" title=" Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;">Colossians 1:11</a>). The rendering "possessions" is necessary because a similar word ("substance" in the Authorised version) will immediately occur. In the last clause two remarkable changes in the Greek text are made necessary by the testimony of our best authorities. The words "in heaven" must certainly be removed; they are omitted in the oldest MSS., and are evidently an explanatory comment which has found its way into the text. For the reading, "in yourselves," there is hardly any evidence whatever. The MSS. are divided between two readings, "yourselves" and "for yourselves;" the former having also the support of the Latin and Coptic versions. There is little doubt that we must read "yourselves;" and the most probable translation will now be, <span class= "ital">perceiving that ye have your own selves for a better possession and one that abideth.</span> They had been taught the meaning of the words spoken by Jesus of the man who gains the world and loses himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-25.htm" title="For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?">Luke 9:25</a>), and of those who win their souls by their endurance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>); so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a> the writer speaks of "the gaining of the soul." Thus trained, they could accept with joy the loss of possessions for the sake of Christ, perceiving that in Him they had received <span class= "ital">themselves</span> as a possession, a better and a lasting possession. (It would be possible to render the clause, "knowing that ye yourselves have a better possession," &c.; but the parallelism of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a> renders it almost certain that the former view of the words is correct.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye had compassion on those who were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession, and an abiding one.</span> For <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which the A.V., so as to avoid the impropriety of expressing sympathy with the bonds themselves, renders "me in my bonds." Even apart from manuscript authority, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is evidently to be preferred, both as suiting the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and as being more likely to have been altered to the common Pauline expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, than <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, especially on the supposition of the writer being St. Paul himself. Thus no evidence as to the authorship of the Epistle is hence deducible. The allusion is to persecutions of Christians, under which the Hebrews addressed had been plundered, and had succored others who were prisoners for the faith, as is intimated also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>. More than one such persecution might be in the writer's view, including, perhaps, that after the stoning of Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); that instituted by Herod Agrippa, under which James the elder suffered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>.); that which led to the martyrdom of James the Just (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:09. 1) and others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:32-39 Many and various afflictions united against the early Christians, and they had a great conflict. The Christian spirit is not a selfish spirit; it puts us upon pitying others, visiting them, helping them, and pleading for them. All things here are but shadows. The happiness of the saints in heaven will last for ever; enemies can never take it away as earthly goods. This will make rich amends for all we may lose and suffer here. The greatest part of the saints' happiness, as yet, is in promise. It is a trial of the patience of Christians, to be content to live after their work is done, and to stay for their reward till God's time to give it is come. He will soon come to them at death, to end all their sufferings, and to give them a crown of life. The Christian's present conflict may be sharp, but will be soon over. God never is pleased with the formal profession and outward duties and services of such as do not persevere; but he beholds them with great displeasure. And those who have been kept faithful in great trails for the time past, have reason to hope for the same grace to help them still to live by faith, till they receive the end of their faith and patience, even the salvation of their souls. Living by faith, and dying in faith, our souls are safe for ever.</body></html>
