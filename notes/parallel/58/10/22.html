As in Hebrews 6 we read of "full assurance," or rather, "fulness of hope," so here of <span class= "ital">fulness of faith.</span> "Without this there could be for us no "living way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm" title="By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;">Hebrews 10:20</a>) for entering into the holiest place. The thought of the whole verse connects itself with the priestly character of those who are the people of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,">Revelation 1:5-6</a>). It is as priests that they enter the house of God, sprinkled with the blood of atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-30.htm" title="And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Leviticus 8:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1Peter 1:2</a>), and with all defilement washed away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm" title="And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.">Leviticus 8:6</a>). "Sprinkled from an evil conscience:" that is, freed by means of the "sprinkling" from a conscience defiled by guilt. In the last words there is a clear allusion to baptism, as the symbol of the new life of purity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body washed with pure water.</span> "Let us draw near" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>) is a liturgical phrase, denoting the approach of the people, after ceremonial atonement, to the earthly sanctuary (cf. ver. 1, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>). We may now draw near to the very heavenly mercy-seat, without any sense of a bar to our doing so on the ground of consciousness of sin. In Christ we are to see accomplished all that is needed for atonement. But there are conditions also required in ourselves, expressed first by the "true heart," and the "fullness of faith," and then by the clauses that fellow. These clauses, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> have a liturgical basis - that of the blood-sprinkling (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> of the people with the blood of the covenant under Mount Sinai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>, and of the priests on their consecration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-23.htm">Leviticus 8:23</a>) and of the ablutions before sacrificial service (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30</a>:39). Hence these two participial clauses are not to be separated from each other, and seem best to be both taken in connection with the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>. "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" means our having the inward consciousness of debarring sin removed through the blood of Christ; the "full assurance of faith" in the completed atonement, and the "true heart," being presupposed. The conjoined clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., is capable also of being figuratively interpreted, in the sense that "our sinful bodies" have been "made clean," so as to be offered through life acceptably as "a living sacrifice," as well as "our souls washed through his most precious blood." And this may be taken as implied. But the terms <span class="accented">body</span> and <span class="accented">water</span> after <span class="accented">hearts</span> and <span class="accented">blood</span> certainly suggest a direct reference to baptism. And such definite allusion is in keeping with references elsewhere to the beginning of the Christian life (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). The passage last referred to is apposite to that before us in that with an undoubted mention of baptism is conjoined "the answer of a good <span class="accented">conscience</span> toward God." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:19-25 The apostle having closed the first part of the epistle, the doctrine is applied to practical purposes. As believers had an open way to the presence of God, it became them to use this privilege. The way and means by which Christians enjoy such privileges, is by the blood of Jesus, by the merit of that blood which he offered up as an atoning sacrifice. The agreement of infinite holiness with pardoning mercy, was not clearly understood till the human nature of Christ, the Son of God, was wounded and bruised for our sins. Our way to heaven is by a crucified Saviour; his death is to us the way of life, and to those who believe this, he will be precious. They must draw near to God; it would be contempt of Christ, still to keep at a distance. Their bodies were to be washed with pure water, alluding to the cleansings directed under the law: thus the use of water in baptism, was to remind Christians that their conduct should be pure and holy. While they derived comfort and grace from their reconciled Father to their own souls, they would adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Believers are to consider how they can be of service to each other, especially stirring up each other to the more vigorous and abundant exercise of love, and the practice of good works. The communion of saints is a great help and privilege, and a means of stedfastness and perseverance. We should observe the coming of times of trial, and be thereby quickened to greater diligence. There is a trying day coming on all men, the day of our death.</body></html>
