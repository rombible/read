For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</span> Both citations are from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35, 36</a>, the second being introduced also into <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-14.htm">Psalm 135:14</a>. The first is remarkable as a combination of the texts of the Hebrew and the LXX., neither being exactly followed. The Hebrew has (A.V.), "To me <span class="accented">belongeth</span> vengeance and recompense;" the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>. And in the same form as in the text the passage is cited <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>. It may be, in this and some other cases of variation from the LXX., that a text different from ours was used by the New Testament writers. The difference here is quite immaterial with regard to the drift of the quotation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:26-31 The exhortations against apostacy and to perseverance, are urged by many strong reasons. The sin here mentioned is a total and final falling away, when men, with a full and fixed will and resolution, despise and reject Christ, the only Saviour; despise and resist the Spirit, the only Sanctifier; and despise and renounce the gospel, the only way of salvation, and the words of eternal life. Of this destruction God gives some notorious sinners, while on earth, a fearful foreboding in their consciences, with despair of being able to endure or to escape it. But what punishment can be sorer than to die without mercy? We answer, to die by mercy, by the mercy and grace which they have despised. How dreadful is the case, when not only the justice of God, but his abused grace and mercy call for vengeance! All this does not in the least mean that any souls who sorrow for sin will be shut out from mercy, or that any will be refused the benefit of Christ's sacrifice, who are willing to accept these blessings. Him that cometh unto Christ, he will in no wise cast out.</body></html>
