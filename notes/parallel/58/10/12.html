One addition is made, in the words, "for ever." These words (which occur in three other places, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-3.htm" title="Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like to the Son of God; stays a priest continually.">Hebrews 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a>) are by many joined with what precedes, by others with the latter part of the sentence, "it down on the right hand of God." The different editions of our Bible and Prayer Book (Epistle for Good Friday) are divided, some (including the earliest) having a comma at the word "ever," others at "sins." In most of our earlier English versions the construction adopted was shown by the arrangement of the words. Thus Tyndale has, "sat him down for ever;" and the Bishops' Bible, "is set down for ever." Coverdale (following Luther) is very clear on the other side: "when He had offered for sins one sacrifice which is of value for ever." Most modern commentators seem to adopt the latter view ("for ever sat down"), but hardly, perhaps, with sufficient reason. The analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a> is distinctly on the other side; and the Greek phrase rendered "for ever" is more suitably applied to the offering of a sacrifice than to the thought of the following words. The contrast to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm" title="And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:">Hebrews 10:11</a> is strongly marked. The sacrificial work has been performed, and the High Priest no longer "standeth ministering." The words "sat down" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>) add to the priestly imagery that of kingly state.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:11-18 Under the new covenant, or gospel dispensation, full and final pardon is to be had. This makes a vast difference between the new covenant and the old one. Under the old, sacrifices must be often repeated, and after all, only pardon as to this world was to be obtained by them. Under the new, one Sacrifice is enough to procure for all nations and ages, spiritual pardon, or being freed from punishment in the world to come. Well might this be called a new covenant. Let none suppose that human inventions can avail those who put them in the place of the sacrifice of the Son of God. What then remains, but that we seek an interest in this Sacrifice by faith; and the seal of it to our souls, by the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience? So that by the law being written in our hearts, we may know that we are justified, and that God will no more remember our sins.</body></html>
