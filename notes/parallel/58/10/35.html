This verse and the next are closely connected: Hold fast your boldness, seeing that to it belongs great reward; hold it fast, for "he that endureth to the end shall be saved." On the last word, "recompence," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35, 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience</span> (or, <span class="accented">endurance</span>)<span class="cmt_word">,</span> <span class="cmt_word">that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise;</span> or, <span class="accented">doing the will of God, ye may receive</span>, etc. The aorist participle <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> does not of necessity express priority to the receiving (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>). The meaning is that by endurance in doing the will they would receive. The full and final enjoyment of what is promised is still future and conditioned by perseverance. Observe the difference between the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, here used, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>. The former (<span class="accented">occ</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19, 39</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm">1 Peter 1:9</a>) means the actual reception of what is denoted, equivalent to <span class="accented">sibi acquirere</span>; the latter (etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-2.htm">James 4:2</a>) means only "to attain to," without involving full possession. It is not said of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>) that he <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, only that he <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>. So also of all the faithful of old described in the following chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>). And even to believing Christians, as this verse shows, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is still future and contingent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:32-39 Many and various afflictions united against the early Christians, and they had a great conflict. The Christian spirit is not a selfish spirit; it puts us upon pitying others, visiting them, helping them, and pleading for them. All things here are but shadows. The happiness of the saints in heaven will last for ever; enemies can never take it away as earthly goods. This will make rich amends for all we may lose and suffer here. The greatest part of the saints' happiness, as yet, is in promise. It is a trial of the patience of Christians, to be content to live after their work is done, and to stay for their reward till God's time to give it is come. He will soon come to them at death, to end all their sufferings, and to give them a crown of life. The Christian's present conflict may be sharp, but will be soon over. God never is pleased with the formal profession and outward duties and services of such as do not persevere; but he beholds them with great displeasure. And those who have been kept faithful in great trails for the time past, have reason to hope for the same grace to help them still to live by faith, till they receive the end of their faith and patience, even the salvation of their souls. Living by faith, and dying in faith, our souls are safe for ever.</body></html>
