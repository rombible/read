This verse and the next correspond to the general thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1-2</a>, so far as it is applicable to "Him who knew no sin."<p>The following rendering will, it is believed, best show the meaning of these two important verses, and the connection of the several parts: <span class= "ital">Who, in the days of His flesh, having with a strong cry and tears offered up prayers and supplications unto Him that was able to save Him out of death, and having been heard for His reverent fear, though He was a son, yet learned obedience by the things which He suffered.</span> The most noticeable change of rendering occurs at the close of the seventh verse; here the interpretation given by all the Greek Fathers, followed in most of our English versions (and in the margin of the Authorised itself), certainly deserves the preference over that which, through the influence of Calvin and Beza, found its way into the Genevan Testament, and hence into the Bishops' Bible and the translation of 1611. The word rendered "reverent fear" occurs in but one other place in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>); but the kindred verb and adjective are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm" title="By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.">Hebrews 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm" title="And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.">Acts 8:2</a>. It properly denotes, not terror, but a cautious foreseeing fear, opposed alike to rashness and to cowardice: the adjective, which is always rendered "devout," is fully explained in the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>. No word could be more suitable where the relation of the Son of Man to His "God and Father" is expressed and it would be very difficult to find any other word which should be suitable to this relation and yet contain no implication of sin to be acknowledged with humility and shame. The object of the "prayers and supplications" thus heard and answered is implied in the words "unto Him that was able to save Him <span class= "ital">out of death."</span> Not "from death:" the Greek words may have that meaning, but it is not their most natural sense, as a comparison of other passages would show. The prayer, we are persuaded, was not that death might be averted, but that there might be granted deliverance out of death. This prayer was answered: His death was the beginning of His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>). It may indeed be asked, Could such a prayer be offered by One who knew "the glory that should follow" His sufferings? In a matter so far beyond our reasoning it is most reverent to point to the mystery of another prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>) offered by Him who had often taught His disciples that He <span class= "ital">must</span> be put to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>). Mark the striking correspondence between the petition thus understood and St. Peter's quotation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm" title="Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.">Acts 2:24</a>). Some of the expressions in this verse would lead us to believe that the writer's thought is resting on the Agony in the Garden; but the "strong cry" brings before us the Crucifixion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-50.htm" title="Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.">Matthew 27:50</a>), and the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm" title="My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?">Psalm 22:1</a> lie very near the thought of this verse. It does not seem necessary to decide--we may doubt whether it is possible, and whether both should not be included. The opening words, "in the days of His flesh" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>), would certainly seem to favour this latter view. The word "offered" must not be lightly passed over. Of frequent occurrence in this Epistle, in every case except one (which is not at all in point) it has a sacrificial sense; it seems certain, therefore, that these prayers--a token of His suffering, an example of His reverent fear--are included in the sacrifice which comprised His whole life and death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up</span> (rather, <span class="accented">when he offered up</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.</span> Here (according to the view taken above of the <span class="accented">chiastic</span> structure of the passage) we have the account of how Christ fulfilled the human requirements of a High Priest, referred to in vers. 2, 3. This main intention of vers. 7, 8 must be kept in mind for a proper understanding of them. Christ is in them regarded, not as executing his priestly office, but as being prepared and consecrated for it. His eternal priesthood is conceived as entered on <span class="accented">after</span> the human experience which is the subject of these verses (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (ver. 9), and what was said under ver. 5). With regard to the participial aorists, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, it is a misapprehension of their proper force to regard them as denoting a time <span class="accented">previous</span> to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8; as if the meaning were - having in Gethsemane "offered," etc., and "been heard," he <span class="accented">afterwards</span> "learnt obedience" on the cross. All they express is that in offering, etc., and being heard, he learned obedience. The idea of subsequent time does not come in till ver. 9; "and being perfected," after thus learning obedience, "he became," etc. Thus the only question with regard to <span class="accented">time</span> in vers. 7, 8 is whether they have reference to the agony in the garden only, or both to the agony and the cross. That they refer mainly, if not exclusively, to the agony is evident from the expressions used, corresponding so closely with the Gospel history. The view presented is, as in the Gospels, of some intense inward struggle, outwardly manifested, and expressing itself in repeated prayers (observe the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) aloud for deliverance. It is true that the Gospels, as we have them now, do not mention <span class="accented">tears</span>; but these too are quite in keeping with the bloody sweat specified by St. Luke, and Epiphanius states that the original copies of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43, 44</a> contained the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. Some interpreters would identify <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> of ver. 7 with the "loud voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>)" from the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). But there is nothing to suggest this; the "strong crying and tears" evidently denote the manner of the "prayers and supplications;" and the thrice-repeated prayer in the garden recorded by the evangelists may be well conceived to have been thus loudly uttered, so as to be heard by the three <span class="accented">disciples</span>, a stone's cast distant, before sleep overcame them. "In cruce clamasse dicitur; lachrymasse non dicitur. Utrum horum respicit locum Gethsemane" (Bengel). What, then, as seen in the light of these verses, was the meaning of the "prayer and supplications" in the garden of Gethsemane? The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>, confirms the view that the "cup" which he prayed might pass from him, was the death before him, and that the purport of his prayer was, not to be raised from death after undergoing it, but to be saved from undergoing it. Such is the ordinary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in reference to one still alive (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-19.htm">Psalm 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). It does not indeed positively follow that, because he prayed to One who was able in this sense to save him, his prayer was that he might be in this sense saved. It is, however, the natural inference. But, if so, two difficulties present themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> How was such a prayer consistent with his distinct knowledge that death must be undergone, and his late strong rebuke to Peter for venturing to dissuade him from it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> How can he be said to have been <span class="accented">heard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>), since he was not saved from death in the sense intended? To the first of these questions the answer is that the prayer expressed, not the deliberate desire of his Divine will, but only the inevitable shrinking of the human will from such an ordeal as was before him. As man, he experienced this shrinking to the full, and as man he craved deliverance, though with entire submission to the will of the Father. His human will did not oppose itself to the Divine will: it conformed itself in the end entirely to it; but this according to the necessary conditions of humanity, through the power of prayer. Had it not been so with him, his participation in human nature would have been incomplete; he would not have been such as to be "touched with a feeling of our infirmities, being in all things tempted like as we are;" nor would he have stood forth for ever as the great Example to mankind. St. John, who so deeply enters into and interprets the mind of Christ, records an utterance before the agony which anticipates its meaning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12.htm">John 12</a>): "The hour is come" (ver. 23); and then (ver. 27), "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour [cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>]; but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy Name." The "hour" was that of the drinking of the cup (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-35.htm">Mark 14:35</a>, "And prayed that, if it were possible, the <span class="accented">hour</span> might pass from him"). "Father, save me from this hour" was the human craving of the agony; but still, "Father, glorify thy Name" was the essence of the prayer; and perfect submission to the Divine will was the outcome of it, after this <span class="accented">troubling</span> of his human soul. The mystery surrounding the whole subject of the Divine and human in Christ remains still. What was said with regard to it about the temptation in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>) is applicable also here. If it be further asked how it was that Christ, in his humanity, so shrank from the "cup" before him, seeing that mere men have been found to face death calmly in its most appalling forms, the answer may be found in the consideration of what this cup implied. It was more than physical death, more than physical pain, more than any sorrow that falls to the lot of man.

Of the <span class="accented">second</span> difficulty mentioned above, as to how Christ was "heard," not having been saved "from death" in the apparent sense of his prayer, the solution may be that the prayer, conditioned as it was by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, was most truly answered by the angel sent to strengthen him, and the power thenceforth given him to "endure the cross, despising the shame." "Mortem ex qua Pater cum liberare posset, ne moreretur, tamen subiit, voluntati Patris obediens: ab horrore plane liberatus est per exauditionem Exauditus est, non ut ne biberet calicem, sed ut jam sine ullo horrore biberet: unde etiam per angelum corroboratus est" (Bengel). The example to us thus becomes the more apparent. For we, too, praying legitimately for release from excessive trial, may have our prayer best answered by grace given to endure the trial, and by "a happy issue" out of it; as was the case with Christ. For his bitter passion was made the path to eternal glory; and thus in the Resurrection too his prayer was answered. The exact meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is not easy to determine. It is taken by a large proportion of commentators to mean "deliverance from his fear;" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> being supposed to be a <span class="accented">constructio praegnans</span> in the sense of "heard so as to be delivered," and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to denote the dread experienced in Gethsemane. So the old Italian Versions, and Ambrose, "exauditus a metu;" so Bengel, "ab hrr-rore liberatus per exauditlonem." This interpretation is upheld by Beza, Grotius, Tholuck, Hofmann, Ebrard, and many others; some of whom, less tenably (as Calvin, Hammond, Jackson), understand <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as meaning, not the fear felt, but the thing feted: "ab eo quod timebat" (Calvin). The objections to this view are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the doubtfulness of the <span class="accented">constructio praegnans</span> (the instances adduced - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a> - are not parallel); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sense assigned to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, since <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and its derivatives, when used to express fear, denote usually, not a shrinking, but a wary or cautious fear, and commonly carry with them (in this Epistle and St. Luke especially) the idea of piety. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>, of Noah, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>: and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm">Acts 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-12.htm">Acts 22:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. The rendering hence preferred by many, having the authority of Chrysostom, and among moderns of Lunemann, Bleek, Delitzsch, Alford, and others, is that of the Vulgate, "exauditus pro sua reverentia." So Vigilius, "propter timorem;" the A.V.," heard in that he feared," or, as in the margin, "heard for his piety;" and in the recent revision, "for his godly fear;" which is the A.V.'s rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>. The objection to the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> to express the <span class="accented">cause</span> of his being heard is met by reference to the frequent usage of St. Luke, whose language most resembles that of our Epistle. Thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm">Luke 19:3</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-14.htm">Acts 12:14</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-11.htm">Acts 22:11</a>). The phrase, thus understood, brings out the more markedly the thoroughly human conditions to which Christ was subjected. It was not in right of his sonship that he was heard. He won his hearing by his human piety; though he was SON, and as such knew that his Father heard him always (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a>), he learnt humanly his lesson of obedience. In the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Son</span> is surely meant in the peculiar sense in which it has all along been applied to Christ, expressing more than that his relation to God was that of <span class="accented">any</span> son to a father, and thus we perceive the full force of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>. It is true that it was not till after the Resurrection that he attained his exalted position as SON (see under Hebrews 1:5 and Hebrews 5:5); but still he was all along the Son, in virtue of his origin as well as of his destiny. Cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>). <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> does not indeed, in itself, express that he was the Second Person of the Trinity (this application of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> being nowhere found in the Epistle); but it implies that, even in his state of humiliation, he was more than man; for there would be nothing very extraordinary, so as to justify <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, in the case of an ordinary son learning obedience to his father through suffering. Recurring now to the question raised under ver. 3, whether the high priest's obligation to offer in the first place for himself had any counterpart in the case of Christ, we may perceive such a counterpart in the agony, as above regarded. For, although for himself Christ needed no atonement, yet the "prayers and supplications" were offered in his own behalf, being due to his own entire participation in the conditions of humanity; the whole "agony and bloody sweat" were part of his own preparation and consecration for executing the office of a High Priest for others, and, like the Aaronic priest's offering for himself, they were the sign and evidence of his being one <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> being all along understood) they answered truly to the preparatory part of Aaron's original consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14 - 9:15</a>), or to the high priest's own offering, before his offering for the people and entering behind the veil, on the Day of Atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-6.htm">Leviticus 14:6</a>). It may be (though not necessarily so) that the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 7, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 3, is intended to suggest this analogy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The High Priest must be a man, a partaker of our nature. This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of that number?</body></html>
