He is entering on a new theme, higher and less level to the comprehension of his readers than any that has gone before. Even so far, we have seen how their Jewish prejudices had evoked admonitions, frequently interposed in the course of the argument. Much more so now, when it is to be shown how the priesthood of Christ not only fulfils the idea of, but also supersedes, that of the sons of Aaron, being of a different order from theirs. The region of thought to be entered now, being that of "<span class="accented">the</span> mystery of Christ," transcends more than any that has been so far entered the ordinary conceptions of traditional Judaism. Hence the writer's shrinking from entering all at once on the subject for fear of not being even understood; hence his earnest warnings to his readers as to the necessity of advancing to the state of full-grown Christians who can discern spiritual things. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm">Hebrews 6:20</a>. - INTERPOSED EXHORTATION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of whom</span> (the most obvious antecedent being Melchizedek, but with regard to his typical significance, as referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">we have many things to say</span> (the subject itself admits a lengthy exposition) and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become (not, as in A.V., "ye are") dull of hearing, Their dullness is the reason of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It was not that the subject was in itself inexplicable, or that the writer was incompetent to explain it; his difficulty was in adapting the interpretation to the capacity of his readers: "Non scribentis, sed vestro vitio" (Bengel). It seems from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("ye are become"), in this and the following verse, that the Hebrew Christians had even retrograded in spiritual perception. This is easily conceivable. As, through the teaching of St. Paul especially, the tie between Christianity and Judaism became more and more broken, there was likely to be a certain reaction among the Hebrew Christians, who, having gone to a certain extent with the tide of thought, became conscious how far it was carrying them. They would be inclined to cling the more fondly to their old associations from the fear of losing them altogether. Such retrogressions have been observable in other times of upheaval of old ideas. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:11-14 Dull hearers make the preaching of the gospel difficult, and even those who have some faith may be dull hearers, and slow to believe. Much is looked for from those to whom much is given. To be unskilful, denotes want of experience in the things of the gospel. Christian experience is a spiritual sense, taste, or relish of the goodness, sweetness, and excellence of the truths of the gospel. And no tongue can express the satisfaction which the soul receives, from a sense of Divine goodness, grace, and love to it in Christ.</body></html>
