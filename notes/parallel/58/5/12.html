Amen.">1Peter 4:11</a>). These first rudiments, which they need to learn again (but which he himself is not about to teach), it may seem natural to identify with what the writer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a> calls "the doctrine of the first principles of Christ." If, however, we examine the usage of the New Testament, of Philo, and of other writers, we shall find good reason for regarding "the oracles of God" as synonymous with the Scriptures of the Old Testament.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("oracles"), is used elsewhere for the revelations of the Old Testament, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>. Here its meaning can hardly be taken as confined to them, since the first principles of the gospel are being spoken cf. Still, a word that includes them in its meaning may be purposely used by way of intimating that the elements intended are those of Judaism as well as Christianity, or of the latter only in its first emergence out of Judaism. And accordingly, vers. 1, 2 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, where they are enumerated, are (as will be seen) so worded as to imply no more than this; nor are the first principles there mentioned beyond what an enlightened Jew might be expected to understand readily. Be it observed that the Hebrew Church need not be supposed to have actually lost sight of these first principles, so as to require a new indoctrination into them. There may be a vein of delicate irony in what is said, after the manner of St. Paul. All that is of necessity implied is that there had been such a failure in seeing what these principles led to as to suggest the necessity of their being learnt anew. The writer does not, in fact, as he goes on, require them to be learnt anew; for he bids his readers leave them behind, as though already known, and proceed from them to perfection, though still with some misgiving as to their capability for doing so. The figure of milk for babes and solid food for full-grown men, to illustrate the teaching suitable for neophytes and for advanced Christians, is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1, 2</a>; and that of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>. This correspondence, though no proof of the Pauline authorship, is among the evidences of the Pauline character of the Epistle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:11-14 Dull hearers make the preaching of the gospel difficult, and even those who have some faith may be dull hearers, and slow to believe. Much is looked for from those to whom much is given. To be unskilful, denotes want of experience in the things of the gospel. Christian experience is a spiritual sense, taste, or relish of the goodness, sweetness, and excellence of the truths of the gospel. And no tongue can express the satisfaction which the soul receives, from a sense of Divine goodness, grace, and love to it in Christ.</body></html>
