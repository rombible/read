See also Gesenius on the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Hence, and in view of the drift of the passage before us, Jackson very decidedly regards <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 9 as a <span class="accented">verbum solenne</span>, denoting specifically Christ's <span class="accented">consecration</span> to his eternal office of High Priest. So also Hammond and Whitby. Being thus perfected, or consecrated, he became, for ever afterwards, the Author, not of mere ceremonial cleansing or temporary remission of guilt, but of eternal salvation; <span class="accented">potentially</span> to all mankind (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>), and <span class="accented">effectively to</span> "<span class="accented">all</span> them that obey him;" being addressed, in tiffs his consummated position (the reference being to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) as "High Priest for ever," etc. Here again we perceive that it is not till after the Resurrection that the prophetic ideal of the SON at God's right hand, and of the eternal High Priest, are regarded as fully realized. If it be objected that his high priesthood must have begun <span class="accented">before</span> the Resurrection for his death upon the cross to be a true atonement, it may be replied that his one oblation of himself upon the cross at once consummated his consecration and effected the atonement. Doubtless, as a true High Priest on earth, he thus "offered one sacrifice for sins for ever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>); all that is meant above is that it was not till after the Resurrection that he entered on his eternal office of mediation in virtue of that one accomplished sacrifice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The High Priest must be a man, a partaker of our nature. This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of that number?</body></html>
