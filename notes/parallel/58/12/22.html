Their drawing nigh was at the same time a standing afar off; the mount of the revelation might not be approached by them; the voice of God was too terrible to be borne; and yet it was only tangible material nature in which God at once manifested and concealed Himself. The true and inner communion with God had not yet been revealed: first must the Law lead to the painful consciousness that sin prevents such communion, and intensify the longing that sin may be taken out of the way. Under the New Covenant, no longer is a tangible mountain the place of a divine revelation made from afar; but heaven is thrown open, and a new super-sensuous world in which God is enthroned is opened to admit us, opened through the Mediator of the New Covenant, accessible in virtue of His atoning blood" (Delitzsch).<p>(22) <span class= "bld">Unto mount Sion.</span>--Literally (and in these difficult verses it is unusually important to follow the literal rendering of the Greek), <span class= "ital">Ye are come unto Zion</span> (<span class= "ital">the</span>)<span class= "ital"> mountain and city of a Living God, a heavenly Jerusalem.</span> The thought of a celestial city which should be the exact counterpart of the earthly Jerusalem is often dwelt upon in Jewish writings: hence the writer is using familiar words, but with a new and spiritual meaning.

(See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>.) This "heavenly Jerusalem" is "Zion, mountain and city of a Living God." Mount Zion is mentioned first, because the contrast with Mount Sinai is throughout present in thought. The name recalls many passages of the Old Testament, especially of the Psalter, as far back as the time when David chose the place for the Ark of the Covenant. Here God desired to dwell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-16.htm" title="Why leap you, you high hills? this is the hill which God desires to dwell in; yes, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.">Psalm 68:16</a>); in this holy hill He set His anointed King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>). (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm" title="Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.">Psalm 48:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-11.htm" title="Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of your judgments.">Psalm 48:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-68.htm" title="But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.">Psalm 78:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm" title="The LORD shall send the rod of your strength out of Zion: rule you in the middle of your enemies.">Psalm 110:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-13.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation.">Psalm 132:13</a>.) Zion is not only the mount of God, His dwelling place; it is also "the city of God," whose gates the Lord loveth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-2.htm" title="The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.">Psalm 87:2</a>). (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/48-12.htm" title="Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.">Psalm 48:12-13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a> we find associated the place of the special manifestation of the glory of God and the resort of His worshipping people; so here the heavenly sanctuary and the city inhabited by "the ransomed of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm" title="And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy on their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.">Isaiah 35:10</a>). In Horeb Israel intreated that they might not hear the voice of "the living God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-26.htm" title="For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived?">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>). In this spiritual commonwealth we all "have drawn nigh" to Him.<p>In the first member of these three verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22-24</a>), therefore, there is very little that is open to question; the difficulties lie in the words which follow, "and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven." Four or five different arrangements of these words are allowed by the Greek, and every one of these has been adopted and defended by writers of eminence. Here the discussion must be very brief. On a careful examination of the whole passage, it seems in the highest degree probable that the writer introduces by" and" each successive member of the sentence, and that groups of words not so introduced serve as appositions, explaining what precedes them. If this be so, the arrangement of the Authorised version is not tenable. We believe that the choice must lie between two renderings: (1) "And to myriads of angels, a festal assembly and congregation of the firstborn enrolled in heaven." (2) "And to myriads, a festal assembly of angels and a congregation of the firstborn enrolled in heaven." In the first of these renderings angels are the subject throughout; in the second, "the myriads" to whom we have come nigh are divided into two companies--the festal host of angels, the church of the firstborn. Let us look at the latter interpretation first. By it the "firstborn" are sought amongst. men; either those who are already inhabitants of the heavenly world, or men still living upon earth, though enrolled as citizens of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.">Luke 10:20</a>). Some have understood the words to relate to those who hold precedency, either in rank or in time, among men to whom God has given the name of sons; as, saints of preeminent piety, "the noble army of martyrs," the faithful under the Old Covenant, Enoch and Elijah, the Apostles, the first generations of Christians, or the believers of the later as distinguished from those of the earlier dispensation. A far more probable explanation is that which makes the word here "equivalent to <span class= "ital">heirs of the kingdom, </span>all faithful Christians being <span class= "ital">ipso facto</span> 'firstborn,' because all are kings" (Dr. Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>). See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>; also, "as instances of the figurative use of <span class= "ital">firstborn</span> in the Old Testament, where the idea of priority of birth is overshadowed by and lost in the idea of pre-eminence," <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-13.htm" title="It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.">Job 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-30.htm" title="And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill your root with famine, and he shall slay your remnant.">Isaiah 14:30</a>. If this be the true interpretation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a> unites the two thoughts which this figure suggests, "Ye are . . . a royal priesthood" (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-16.htm" title="Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.">Hebrews 12:16</a>); and the whole of that verse. especially as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a>, well illustrates the position here assigned to the company of the faithful upon earth. The word which we have here rendered <span class= "ital">congregation, </span>moreover, is that which is regularly applied to the Church of Christ. There is, therefore, very much to be said on behalf of this interpretation, which is in every way attractive. And yet, full of interest as is such an explanation of the special words, it seems certainly unsuitable to the passage as a whole. It is not easy to believe that the words "and to myriads" are to be taken by themselves. It is still more difficult to explain the introduction of the living Church on earth in this position--between angels and the "God of all," whilst "the spirits of just men made perfect" are mentioned later, in an association from which the Church on earth cannot be severed--with "Jesus the Mediator of a new covenant and the blood of sprinkling." For these reasons especially it seems necessary to adopt the first-mentioned arrangement of the words: "ye have come near . . . to myriads of angels, a festal assembly and congregation of the firstborn enrolled in heaven." Two passages of the Old Testament seem to have been chiefly in the writer's mind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm" title="A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.">Daniel 7:10</a>); in each of these the Lord appears attended by "myriads of angels," who stand before Him and minister to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm" title="Bless the LORD, you his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word.">Psalm 103:20</a>). We who by means of the "better hope draw near to God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>) are led to this "holy hill" and city, and through the hosts of "ministering spirits" into the very presence of the "God of all." The descriptive words which follow are borrowed from the history of Israel. The first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-11.htm" title="And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.">Ezekiel 46:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-11.htm" title="I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.">Hosea 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-5.htm" title="What will you do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?">Hosea 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm" title="I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.">Amos 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-10.htm" title="Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her:">Isaiah 66:10</a>) is the general and joyous gathering for the feasts of the Lord; the second is the word used throughout for the "church in the wilderness," the "congregation" of Israel. The latter points to the united body of the servants of God, the former to the joyful gathering for His service. The second word is so commonly used of Israel and of the Christian Church that it has been denied that any other application is ever made; but there is certainly an exception in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-7.htm" title="God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.">Psalm 89:7</a> (a Psalm which, as we have seen, was much in the writer's thoughts), "God is greatly to be feared in the congregation of the saints." How fitly angels--who in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm" title="Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.">Job 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm" title="Give to the LORD, O you mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.">Psalm 29:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>are called "sons of God," are here spoken of as "firstborn," needs no explanation; they are the enrolled citizens of heaven, whose assembly we are permitted to join (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-11.htm" title="And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;">Revelation 5:11</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-36.htm" title="Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.">Luke 20:36</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.</span> Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4.htm">Galatians 4</a>, Zion and Jerusalem, ideally regarded, are contrasted with Sinai. The foundation of the conception is in the Old Testament. When David at length won the citadel of Zion, and placed the ark upon it, it was a sort of primary and typical fulfillment of the promise of rest, seen afar off by the patriarchs and from the wilderness. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>, which was sung on that occasion, expresses the idea of the King of glory being at length enthroned there, and his people of clean hands and pure hearts being admitted to stand in the holy place before him (cf. "This is my rest forever: here will I dwell," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-14.htm">Psalm 132:14</a>). In the Psalms generally the holy hill of Zion continues to be viewed as the LORD'S immovable abode, where he is surrounded by thousands of angels, and whence he succors his people (cf. <span class="accented">Psalm</span> 48; 68; 125; 132; etc.). Then by the prophets it is further idealized as the scene and center of Messianic blessings (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>; 25:13; 33; 35; 46:13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4.htm">Micah 4</a>; to which many other passages might be added). Compare also the visions, in the latter chapters of Ezekiel, of the ideal city and temple of the future age. Lastly, in the Apocalypse the seer has visions of "Mount Zion" (14.), and "the holy city, new Jerusalem" (21.), with the presence there of God and the Lamb, and with myriads of angels, and innumerable multitudes of saints redeemed. If, in the passage before us, a distinction is to be made between "Mount Zion" and "the heavenly Jerusalem," it may be that the former represents the Church below, the latter the heavenly regions, though both are blent together in one grand picture of the communion of saints. For so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. the hundred and forty-four thousand on Mount Zion seem distinct from the singers and harpers round the throne, whose song is heard from heaven and learnt by those below; while the picture of the holy city in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. is one entirely heavenly, representing there the final consummation rather than any present state of things. <span class="cmt_word">And to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn</span> (rather, <span class="accented">and to myriads</span>, <span class="accented">the general assembly of angels</span>, <span class="accented">and the Church of the Firstborn</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel</span> (literally, <span class="accented">than Abel</span>). Of the several ways of translating the beginning of the above passage, the best seems to be to take <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by itself as including both the angels and the Church of the Firstborn, and to connect <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> with "angels" only. "Myriads" is a well-known expression for the LORD'S attendant hosts (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-14.htm">Jude 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-2.htm">Deuteronomy 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>); further, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, which throughout the passage connects the different objects approached, comes between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the application of both <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would seem an unmeaning redundancy. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which in classical Greek denotes properly the assembly of a whole nation for a festival, is peculiarly appropriate to the angels, whether regarded (as in the Old Testament) as ministering round the throne or as congregated to rejoice over man's redemption. "The Church of the Firstborn" seems to denote the Church militant rather than the Church triumphant; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is elsewhere used for the Church on earth (so also in the Old Testament; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, expresses the idea of being enrolled in the books of heaven rather than being already there (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the "spirits of the perfected" are mentioned afterwards as a class distinct. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may be suggested here by the firstborn of Israel, who were specially hallowed to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a>), and numbered as such by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>), or perhaps still more by the birthright (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) spoken of above as forfeited by Esau. God's elect may be called his firstborn as being hallowed to him and heirs of his promises (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>," Israel is my son, <span class="accented">even</span> my firstborn;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>, "Ephraim is my firstborn"). They thus correspond to the hundred and forty-four thousand of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>, standing on Mount Zion, being "redeemed from the earth," and having "the Father's Name written on their foreheads;" seen distinct from, and yet in communion with, the saints in bliss, whose voices are heard above. Between them and the spirits of the perfected is interposed, "God the Judge of all;" and this appropriately, since before him the saints on earth must appear ere they join the ranks of the perfected: the former look up to him from below; the latter have already passed before him to the rest assigned them. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> ("perfected") expresses, as elsewhere in the Epistle, full accomplishment of an and or purpose with regard to things or persons (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-9.htm">Hebrews 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-40.htm">Hebrews 11:40</a>); the word is used here of those whose warfare is accomplished, and who have attained the rest of God. Their "spirits" only are spoken of, because the "perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul" is still to come. In the mean while, with respect to the issue of their earthly course, they have been already perfected (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, "They rest from their labors"). Corresponding to the Lamb in Revelation, there is seen next Jesus the Mediator, through whom is the approach of the whole company to the Judge of all, and the accomplishment to the perfected. The "<span class="accented">new</span> covenant" is, of course, meant to be contrasted with the old one before Mount Sinai, under which there was no such approach or accomplishment. Then "the blood of sprinkling" has reference to that wherewith the old covenant was ratified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>; <span class="accented">cf. supra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18</a>). The blood shed by Christ on earth for atonement is conceived as carried by him with himself into the holy place on high (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>), to be forever "<span class="accented">the</span> blood of sprinkling for effectual cleansing. And this blood "speaketh better things than Abel." His blood cried from the ground for vengeance, with the accusing voice of primeval sin; Christ's speaks only of reconciliation and peace. Some commentators (Bengel in the first place, whom Delitzsch follows)see in this contrast between Sinai and Zion a distinct parallelism between vers. 18, 19 and vers. 22-24; seven objects of approach in one case being supposed to be set against seven in the other, More obvious is the correspondence of the successive clauses of vers. 22-24 to the general ideas connected with the giving of the Law. The two pictures may be contrasted thus - <span class="accented">The Old Covenant.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sinai, a palpable earthly mountain, surrounded by gloom and storm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The angels through whom the Law was given (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2</a>), unseen by men, but operating in the winds and in the fire (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Israel congregated under the mountain, afraid, and forbidden to touch it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LORD, unapproachable, shrouded in darkness or revealed in fire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Moses, himself afraid, and winning through his mediation no access for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The blood sprinkled on the people to ratify the old covenant, but which could not cleanse the conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, inspiring fear. <span class="accented">The New Covenant.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Zion, radiant with light and crowned with the city of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Festal choirs of assembled angels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The accepted Church of the Firstborn, with free approach to the holiest of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Judge of all, without his terrors, accessible, and awarding rest to the perfected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Divine availing Mediator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ever-cleansing blood of complete atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The voice of that cleansing blood, speaking of peace and pardon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such is the vision by the contemplation of which the inspired writer would arouse his readers, amid their trials and waverings, to realize the things that are eternal. He would have them pierce with the eye of faith beyond this visible scene into the world invisible, which is no less real. If they were perplexed and disheartened by what they found around them - by the opposition of the world and the fewness of the faithful - he bids them associate themselves in thought with those countless multitudes who were on their side. The picture is, indeed, in some respects, ideal; for the actual Church on earth does not come up to the idea of the "Church of the Firstborn;" but it is presented according to God's purpose for his people, and it rests with us to make it a present reality to ourselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:18-29 Mount Sinai, on which the Jewish church state was formed, was a mount such as might be touched, though forbidden to be so, a place that could be felt; so the Mosaic dispensation was much in outward and earthly things. The gospel state is kind and condescending, suited to our weak frame. Under the gospel all may come with boldness to God's presence. But the most holy must despair, if judged by the holy law given from Sinai, without a Saviour. The gospel church is called Mount Zion; there believers have clearer views of heaven, and more heavenly tempers of soul. All the children of God are heirs, and every one has the privileges of the first-born. Let a soul be supposed to join that glorious assembly and church above, that is yet unacquainted with God, still carnally-minded, loving this present world and state of things, looking back to it with a lingering eye, full of pride and guile, filled with lusts; such a soul would seem to have mistaken its way, place, state, and company. It would be uneasy to itself and all about it. Christ is the Mediator of this new covenant, between God and man, to bring them together in this covenant; to keep them together; to plead with God for us, and to plead with us for God; and at length to bring God and his people together in heaven. This covenant is made firm by the blood of Christ sprinkled upon our consciences, as the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled upon the altar and the victim. This blood of Christ speaks in behalf of sinners; it pleads not for vengeance, but for mercy. See then that you refuse not his gracious call and offered salvation. See that you do not refuse Him who speaketh from heaven, with infinite tenderness and love; for how can those escape, who turn from God in unbelief or apostacy, while he so graciously beseeches them to be reconciled, and to receive his everlasting favour! God's dealing with men under the gospel, in a way of grace, assures us, that he will deal with the despisers of the gospel, in a way of judgment. We cannot worship God acceptably, unless we worship him with reverence and godly fear. Only the grace of God enables us to worship God aright. God is the same just and righteous God under the gospel as under the law. The inheritance of believers is secured to them; and all things pertaining to salvation are freely given in answer to prayer. Let us seek for grace, that we may serve God with reverence and godly fear.</body></html>
