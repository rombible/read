In that chapter Moses had again brought before the people the covenant which, nearly forty years before, had been made and ratified "in Horeb" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-18.htm" title="Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.">Hebrews 9:18-20</a>). With especial solemnity he sets before them the sin and terrible punishment of idolatry, "Lest there should be among you man or woman . . . whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood." The marginal note on the last words ("poisonful herb") explains their true meaning--that which springs from the root is not merely bitter, it is also poisonous. Again, therefore (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-27.htm" title="But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.">Hebrews 10:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a>), the apostasy to which the Hebrew Christians were tempted is compared with the sin committed by those who by idolatry fell away from God's ancient covenant; and as one idol-worshipper in a community might bring into it a root of bitter poison, so one apostate from the Christian faith would bring trouble and defilement on the Church. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm" title="For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.">Acts 8:23</a> St. Peter makes reference to the same chapter of Deuteronomy as he speaks to Simon Magus, who, above all other men, proved a root of bitter poison in the early Church.<p><span class= "bld">Many</span>.--Rather, <span class= "ital">the many</span> (according to the best reading)--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the whole community.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> fall short of it; or, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> being here followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>, the idea may be rather that of falling back from it); <span class="cmt_word">lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many</span> (or, according to the more probable reading, <span class="accented">the many</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the general community) <span class="cmt_word">be defiled.</span> In this, the usual rendering of the verse, <span class="greek">&#x1fc7;</span> is supplied, so as to make <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> mean "lest <span class="accented">there be</span> any one that fails."

The reference in the speech of Moses is to the future possibility of any "man, or we man, or family, or tribe" turning from the LORD to go and serve the gods of the nations, and so involving, not only themselves, but even the whole people in a curse. The figure is that of a plant being allowed to grow of such a nature at its root as to bear bitter and pernicious fruit. There is no special allusion in the word "bitterness" to disturbance of "peace" by dissensions; for this is not the idea in the original passage, nor is it carried out in the following verses of the Epistle. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm">Acts 8:23</a>, "Thou art in the gall of bitterness (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)") <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 A burden of affliction is apt to make the Christian's hands hang down, and his knees grow feeble, to dispirit him and discourage him; but against this he must strive, that he may better run his spiritual race and course. Faith and patience enable believers to follow peace and holiness, as a man follows his calling constantly, diligently, and with pleasure. Peace with men, of all sects and parties, will be favourable to our pursuit of holiness. But peace and holiness go together; there can be not right peace without holiness. Where persons fail of having the true grace of God, corruption will prevail and break forth; beware lest any unmortified lust in the heart, which seems to be dead, should spring up, to trouble and disturb the whole body. Falling away from Christ is the fruit of preferring the delights of the flesh, to the blessing of God, and the heavenly inheritance, as Esau did. But sinners will not always have such mean thoughts of the Divine blessing and inheritance as they now have. It agrees with the profane man's disposition, to desire the blessing, yet to despise the means whereby the blessing is to be gained. But God will neither sever the means from the blessing, nor join the blessing with the satisfying of man's lusts. God's mercy and blessing were never sought carefully and not obtained.</body></html>
