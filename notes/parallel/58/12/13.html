If the words be rendered, "that what is lame may not be turned out of the way, but may rather be healed," we cannot but feel that the two members are somewhat incongruous. It is probable, therefore, that the first verb here bears the meaning which it not unfrequently has in medical writers, <span class= "ital">be put out of joint.</span> Let the paths (or tracks) which you follow be straight, for crooked and uneven paths will make the limbs which are lame more helpless still; should nothing aggravate the hurt that has been received, it may soon be healed. In the application, the words are a warning against the shifting courses of men who are ready to turn aside from strict duty when persecution threatens, and seek to avert the danger by compliance with what they do not in heart approve. Whatever may be the result in the case of "the strong" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.">Romans 14:1</a>; 1 Corinthians 8), the example brings destruction on "the weak."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but that it rather be healed.</span> The ideas in this verse correspond to, and may be suggested by, those that follow in Isaiah the passage above referred to. For there too the prophet goes on to speak, among other things, of the lame leaping, and of a way of holiness along which none should err. But the words themselves are suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (LXX.), the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> having been previously used for turning out of the way. It is observable that the words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., are arranged so as to form an hexameter line. This may have been unintentional, but it is at any rate effective. Delitzsch remarks on it. "The duty to which the writer urges, his, readers is courageous self-recovery m Gods strength. The tone and language are elevated accordingly, and ver. 12 is like a trumpet-blast. It need not surprise us, then, if our author here turns poet, and proceeds in heroic measures." With regard to the purport of this verse, we observe that, while the figure of running is still continued, a new idea is introduced - that of pursuing a straight course with a view to others who are to follow on the same track. "That which is lame (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" denotes the weak and wavering brethren - the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, such as are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. The expression well suits (specially those among the Hebrew Christians who halted between two opinions - between the Church and the synagogue (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>;). The strong in faith ought to desire and aim at the <span class="accented">healing</span> of such lame ones, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their being strengthened in the faith, rather than expose them to the risk of apostasy by any wavering of their own. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 A burden of affliction is apt to make the Christian's hands hang down, and his knees grow feeble, to dispirit him and discourage him; but against this he must strive, that he may better run his spiritual race and course. Faith and patience enable believers to follow peace and holiness, as a man follows his calling constantly, diligently, and with pleasure. Peace with men, of all sects and parties, will be favourable to our pursuit of holiness. But peace and holiness go together; there can be not right peace without holiness. Where persons fail of having the true grace of God, corruption will prevail and break forth; beware lest any unmortified lust in the heart, which seems to be dead, should spring up, to trouble and disturb the whole body. Falling away from Christ is the fruit of preferring the delights of the flesh, to the blessing of God, and the heavenly inheritance, as Esau did. But sinners will not always have such mean thoughts of the Divine blessing and inheritance as they now have. It agrees with the profane man's disposition, to desire the blessing, yet to despise the means whereby the blessing is to be gained. But God will neither sever the means from the blessing, nor join the blessing with the satisfying of man's lusts. God's mercy and blessing were never sought carefully and not obtained.</body></html>
