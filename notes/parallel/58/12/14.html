As, however, this Epistle especially brings Him before us as the Sanctifier (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm" title="Why Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.">Hebrews 13:12</a>), who leads us into the presence of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>), we must rather look on these words as akin to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Follow peace with all</span> (i.e. as required by the context, with all the brethren; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and holiness</span> (more properly, <span class="accented">sanctification</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>without which no man shall see the Lord.</span> Here the figure is dropped, and two cautions given, peculiarly needed, we may suppose, by the community addressed. The exhortation to "peace with all" reminds of the tone of St. Paul's admonitions both in Romans and in 1 Corinthians, where he so strongly warns against dissensions and party spirit, and enjoins tolerance and mutual allowance with regard to the weaker brethren. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> ("sanctification") need not be limited (as by Chrysostom) to the idea of <span class="accented">chastity</span>; the general thought implied may be (as expressed by Limborch, quoted by Alford), "<span class="accented">No</span>, dum pact studeat, nimis slits obsequendi studio quidquam contra sanctimonism Christianam delinquat;" but the special allusion to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 16 (as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>) is evidence that <span class="accented">chastity</span> was especially in the writer's mind, with definite reference to which the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>. The frequent and earnest warnings against fornication in St. Paul's Epistles are enough to show how slow even some in the Church were to recognize the strict code of Christian morality, unknown to the heathen world, and by the Jews very imperfectly recognized, in this regard; and the case of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>. illustrates how easily such vice might creep into and infect a Christian community without general reprobation. Hence probably the special warning here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 A burden of affliction is apt to make the Christian's hands hang down, and his knees grow feeble, to dispirit him and discourage him; but against this he must strive, that he may better run his spiritual race and course. Faith and patience enable believers to follow peace and holiness, as a man follows his calling constantly, diligently, and with pleasure. Peace with men, of all sects and parties, will be favourable to our pursuit of holiness. But peace and holiness go together; there can be not right peace without holiness. Where persons fail of having the true grace of God, corruption will prevail and break forth; beware lest any unmortified lust in the heart, which seems to be dead, should spring up, to trouble and disturb the whole body. Falling away from Christ is the fruit of preferring the delights of the flesh, to the blessing of God, and the heavenly inheritance, as Esau did. But sinners will not always have such mean thoughts of the Divine blessing and inheritance as they now have. It agrees with the profane man's disposition, to desire the blessing, yet to despise the means whereby the blessing is to be gained. But God will neither sever the means from the blessing, nor join the blessing with the satisfying of man's lusts. God's mercy and blessing were never sought carefully and not obtained.</body></html>
