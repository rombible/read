Moreover, it is required for the sense of the passage in regard to the proper meaning of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("endure"), which is to "submit to," or "endure patiently," not simply "to undergo." For to say, "if ye endure chastisement patiently, God dealeth with you as sons," has no meaning; our being treated as sons depends, not on the way we take our chastisement, but on our being chastised at all. The use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> to express purpose is common in this Epistle (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: 3:5, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: 4:16, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: 6:16, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>): and the essential sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is discipline or education. The drift is the same, whether we take <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> as an indicative or an imperative. Thus the next clause of the verse follows suitably: <span class="cmt_word">God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there</span> (or, <span class="accented">who is a son</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whom his father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastening, whereof all</span> (i.e. all God's children, with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons</span> (ye are not your father's real children whom he cares for as such). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-11 The persevering obedience of faith in Christ, was the race set before the Hebrews, wherein they must either win the crown of glory, or have everlasting misery for their portion; and it is set before us. By the sin that does so easily beset us, understand that sin to which we are most prone, or to which we are most exposed, from habit, age, or circumstances. This is a most important exhortation; for while a man's darling sin, be it what it will, remains unsubdued, it will hinder him from running the Christian race, as it takes from him every motive for running, and gives power to every discouragement. When weary and faint in their minds, let them recollect that the holy Jesus suffered, to save them from eternal misery. By stedfastly looking to Jesus, their thoughts would strengthen holy affections, and keep under their carnal desires. Let us then frequently consider him. What are our little trials to his agonies, or even to our deserts? What are they to the sufferings of many others? There is a proneness in believers to grow weary, and to faint under trials and afflictions; this is from the imperfection of grace and the remains of corruption. Christians should not faint under their trials. Though their enemies and persecutors may be instruments to inflict sufferings, yet they are Divine chastisements; their heavenly Father has his hand in all, and his wise end to answer by all. They must not make light of afflictions, and be without feeling under them, for they are the hand and rod of God, and are his rebukes for sin. They must not despond and sink under trials, nor fret and repine, but bear up with faith and patience. God may let others alone in their sins, but he will correct sin in his own children. In this he acts as becomes a father. Our earthly parents sometimes may chasten us, to gratify their passion, rather than to reform our manners. But the Father of our souls never willingly grieves nor afflicts his children. It is always for our profit. Our whole life here is a state of childhood, and imperfect as to spiritual things; therefore we must submit to the discipline of such a state. When we come to a perfect state, we shall be fully reconciled to all God's chastisement of us now. God's correction is not condemnation; the chastening may be borne with patience, and greatly promote holiness. Let us then learn to consider the afflictions brought on us by the malice of men, as corrections sent by our wise and gracious Father, for our spiritual good.</body></html>
