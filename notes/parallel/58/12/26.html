The terrors of Sinai were, moreover, a type of a more terrible revelation of judgment, when not only shall the earth tremble, but the earth and the heaven shall be moved, and all that is transitory and mutable shall pass away. The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;">Haggai 2:6</a> are taken as a prophecy of this consummation. The reference of the prediction of which this forms part to the <span class= "ital">first</span> coming of the Messiah is passed over; it is only as bearing upon the last days that the words are quoted here.<p><span class= "bld">Now he hath promised.</span>--This whole time of waiting is included in the "now." It is as if the words were: "now we have this promise, and are looking for its fulfilment."<p><span class= "bld">I shake.</span>--Rather (according to the better reading), <span class= "ital">I will move</span> (or, <span class= "ital">make to tremble</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose voice then shook the earth</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, "The whole mount quaked greatly," though there the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: but cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a>, "The earth trembled," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-7.htm">Psalm 114:7</a>, "Tremble, thou earth," etc., with reference to the phenomena at Sinai; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6, 10</a>): <span class="cmt_word">but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</span> The prophecy referred to is <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6, 7</a>, "Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts." Again, ver. 21, "I will shake the heavens and the earth" (cf. lea. 2:19, 21). The prophecy was uttered with reference to the second temple, the glory of which was to be greater than the glory of the first, in that it should be the scene of the LORD'S final revelation of himself to his people. Its first fulfillment is rightly seen in Christ's first coming (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>, "And in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple"). But the language used points evidently, even in itself, to a further fulfillment; nor do readers need to be reminded here of the pregnant and far-reaching sense of all Messianic prophecy. "Illustre est testimonium Psalm Newtoni ad Dan. p. 91: <span class="accented">vixque in omni V.T. aliquod de Christo extat vaticinium</span>, <span class="accented">quod non</span>, <span class="accented">aliquatenus saltem</span>, <span class="accented">secundum ejus ad-ventum respiciat"</span> (Bengel). The ultimate reference is what is seen dimly afar off in so many of the prophetic visions - the final dissolution of the whole present order of things, to be succeeded by the kingdom of eternal righteousness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>, etc.). By the heaven that is to be shaken in that great day is meant, of course, not the eternal abode of God, but that which is created and visible (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 27). This final shaking is set against the local and typical shaking of Mount Sinai in two points of contrast - its extending to the whole creation, and its being once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>); and from the latter expression the removing of the things thus finally shaken is in the next verse inferred. This inference, though not following necessarily from the expression itself, is involved in the general drift of Haggai's prophecy, taken in connection with other cognate ones, in which an entirely new and heavenly order is pictured as rising over the ruins of the old (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>, referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7, 10, 13</a>, "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:18-29 Mount Sinai, on which the Jewish church state was formed, was a mount such as might be touched, though forbidden to be so, a place that could be felt; so the Mosaic dispensation was much in outward and earthly things. The gospel state is kind and condescending, suited to our weak frame. Under the gospel all may come with boldness to God's presence. But the most holy must despair, if judged by the holy law given from Sinai, without a Saviour. The gospel church is called Mount Zion; there believers have clearer views of heaven, and more heavenly tempers of soul. All the children of God are heirs, and every one has the privileges of the first-born. Let a soul be supposed to join that glorious assembly and church above, that is yet unacquainted with God, still carnally-minded, loving this present world and state of things, looking back to it with a lingering eye, full of pride and guile, filled with lusts; such a soul would seem to have mistaken its way, place, state, and company. It would be uneasy to itself and all about it. Christ is the Mediator of this new covenant, between God and man, to bring them together in this covenant; to keep them together; to plead with God for us, and to plead with us for God; and at length to bring God and his people together in heaven. This covenant is made firm by the blood of Christ sprinkled upon our consciences, as the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled upon the altar and the victim. This blood of Christ speaks in behalf of sinners; it pleads not for vengeance, but for mercy. See then that you refuse not his gracious call and offered salvation. See that you do not refuse Him who speaketh from heaven, with infinite tenderness and love; for how can those escape, who turn from God in unbelief or apostacy, while he so graciously beseeches them to be reconciled, and to receive his everlasting favour! God's dealing with men under the gospel, in a way of grace, assures us, that he will deal with the despisers of the gospel, in a way of judgment. We cannot worship God acceptably, unless we worship him with reverence and godly fear. Only the grace of God enables us to worship God aright. God is the same just and righteous God under the gospel as under the law. The inheritance of believers is secured to them; and all things pertaining to salvation are freely given in answer to prayer. Let us seek for grace, that we may serve God with reverence and godly fear.</body></html>
