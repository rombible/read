The following clause may seem to confine our thought to the latter; but, with a lower sense of "righteousness," the maxim is true of the wise discipline of earthly parents.<p><span class= "bld">The peaceable fruit of righteousness.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">peaceful fruit, </span>(<span class= "ital">fruit</span>)<span class= "ital"> of righteousness, to them that have been trained thereby.</span> The "peaceful" fruit stands in contrast with the unrest and trouble which have preceded during the time of "chastening." But there is more than rest after conflict, for the object of the conflict is attained; the fruit consists in righteousness. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-17.htm" title="And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.">Isaiah 32:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-30.htm" title="The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that wins souls is wise.">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Philippians 1:11</a>.) It has been sometimes supposed that in the word "trained" the writer returns to the figure of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-4.htm" title="You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.">Hebrews 12:4</a>; but this is not probable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now no chastening seemeth for the present to be joyous, but grievous</span> (literally, <span class="accented">not of joy</span>, <span class="accented">but of grief</span>): <span class="cmt_word">nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them which have been exercised thereby.</span> This is a general statement with respect to all chastening, though the expression of its result at the end of the verse is suggested by the thought of Divine chastening, to which alone it is certainly, and in the full sense of the words, applicable. "<span class="accented">Of</span> righteousness" is a genitive of apposition; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is the peaceable fruit yielded by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. And the word here surely denotes actual righteousness in ourselves; not merely justification in what is called the forensic sense: the proper effect of chastening is to make us good, and so at peace with our own conscience and with God. It is by no means thus implied that we can be accepted and so have peace <span class="accented">on the ground</span> of our own imperfect righteousness; only that it is in the fruits of faith perfected by discipline that we may "know that we are of the truth, and assure our hearts before him" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-18.htm">James 3:18</a>, "The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>, "And the work of righteousness shall be peace"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-11 The persevering obedience of faith in Christ, was the race set before the Hebrews, wherein they must either win the crown of glory, or have everlasting misery for their portion; and it is set before us. By the sin that does so easily beset us, understand that sin to which we are most prone, or to which we are most exposed, from habit, age, or circumstances. This is a most important exhortation; for while a man's darling sin, be it what it will, remains unsubdued, it will hinder him from running the Christian race, as it takes from him every motive for running, and gives power to every discouragement. When weary and faint in their minds, let them recollect that the holy Jesus suffered, to save them from eternal misery. By stedfastly looking to Jesus, their thoughts would strengthen holy affections, and keep under their carnal desires. Let us then frequently consider him. What are our little trials to his agonies, or even to our deserts? What are they to the sufferings of many others? There is a proneness in believers to grow weary, and to faint under trials and afflictions; this is from the imperfection of grace and the remains of corruption. Christians should not faint under their trials. Though their enemies and persecutors may be instruments to inflict sufferings, yet they are Divine chastisements; their heavenly Father has his hand in all, and his wise end to answer by all. They must not make light of afflictions, and be without feeling under them, for they are the hand and rod of God, and are his rebukes for sin. They must not despond and sink under trials, nor fret and repine, but bear up with faith and patience. God may let others alone in their sins, but he will correct sin in his own children. In this he acts as becomes a father. Our earthly parents sometimes may chasten us, to gratify their passion, rather than to reform our manners. But the Father of our souls never willingly grieves nor afflicts his children. It is always for our profit. Our whole life here is a state of childhood, and imperfect as to spiritual things; therefore we must submit to the discipline of such a state. When we come to a perfect state, we shall be fully reconciled to all God's chastisement of us now. God's correction is not condemnation; the chastening may be borne with patience, and greatly promote holiness. Let us then learn to consider the afflictions brought on us by the malice of men, as corrections sent by our wise and gracious Father, for our spiritual good.</body></html>
