Had this word been in the sentence as originally written, its absence from all our more ancient authorities would be inexplicable; whilst, on the other hand, the contrast with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>, and the recollection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm" title="And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>, from which the last words in this verse are taken, would very naturally lead a transcriber to supply this word, which he might suppose to have accidentally dropped out of the text. If, however, the writer did not make use of the word here, though the contrast of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a> was already before his mind, it seems certain that the word was not in his thought; and hence we have no right to introduce it in the explanation of the verse. The true translation, in all probability, is as follows: <span class= "ital">For ye are not come unto a material</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">a palpable</span>)<span class= "ital"> and kindled fire, and unto gloom and darkness and tempest.</span> The object of the writer is to set forth the terrors which accompanied the giving of the Law,--that which the awe-stricken people saw and heard. Not the mount, but the terrible fire was that which met their gaze. Thus again and again in Deuteronomy we find reference to the voice and the fire alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-33.htm" title="Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?">Deuteronomy 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-36.htm" title="Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he showed you his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.">Deuteronomy 4:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-4.htm" title="The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the middle of the fire,">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/5-25.htm" title="Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.">Deuteronomy 5:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-16.htm" title="According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>). Shortly before "the day of the assembly" in Horeb Israel had been led by "a pillar of fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm" title="For our God is a consuming fire.">Hebrews 12:29</a> of this chapter the figure of "a consuming fire" is applied to God Himself. To avoid such associations as these, and vividly to represent what then was shown to the Israelites, he speaks of "a material and kindled fire." The metaphor in "palpable" as applied to fire is hardly more remarkable than that involved in "a darkness which may be felt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.">Exodus 10:21</a>, where the word used in the LXX. is almost the same as that which we have here).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-29.</span> - There follows now, both for encouragement and for warning, a grand contrast between the Mosaic and Christian dispensations, founded on the phenomena that accompanied the giving of the Law. To Mount Sinai, with its repelling terrors, is opposed an ideal picture of Mount Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem, expressive of the communion of saints in Christ. And then at ver. 25 (as previously in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>.) the tone of encouragement changes again to one of warning, the very excess of privilege being made the measure of the guilt of slighting it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned, with fire, and unto blackness and darkness and tempest.</span> The allusion is to the Israelites approaching Mount Sinai when the Law was given (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>, whence still more than from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>. the whole description is taken, "And ye came near [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, the same word as is used supra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>], and stood under the mountain"). Though the word "mount" in the Received Text has the support of no ancient authority, it must be understood, whether or not originally written. For it comes after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in the passage of Deuteronomy which is evidently referred to, the following words, "blackness, darkness, tempest" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>), being also found there. And otherwise we should have to translate, "a touched [i.e. palpable] and kindled fire;" but "touched" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>) is not suitable to <span class="accented">fire</span>; and we should also lose the evidently intended contrast between the two mountains of Sinai and Zion, which appears in ver. 22. Neither may we trans- late, as some would do, "a mountain that might be touched, and kindled fire;" for the original passage in Deuteronomy has "and the mountain burned with fire (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>)." The participle <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> (literally, that was touched), rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, may be used here, although on the occasion referred to all were forbidden to touch the mountain, by way of bringing more distinctly into view the actual Sinai, which was touched at other times, and which Moses both touched and ascended. If so, the main purpose of the word is to contrast the local and palpable mountain of the Law with the ideal Mount Zion which is afterwards spoken cf. Or, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> may here carry with it its common sense of groping after, as in the dark (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), with reference to the cloudy darkness about Sinai, and in contrast with the clear unclouded vision of Zion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:18-29 Mount Sinai, on which the Jewish church state was formed, was a mount such as might be touched, though forbidden to be so, a place that could be felt; so the Mosaic dispensation was much in outward and earthly things. The gospel state is kind and condescending, suited to our weak frame. Under the gospel all may come with boldness to God's presence. But the most holy must despair, if judged by the holy law given from Sinai, without a Saviour. The gospel church is called Mount Zion; there believers have clearer views of heaven, and more heavenly tempers of soul. All the children of God are heirs, and every one has the privileges of the first-born. Let a soul be supposed to join that glorious assembly and church above, that is yet unacquainted with God, still carnally-minded, loving this present world and state of things, looking back to it with a lingering eye, full of pride and guile, filled with lusts; such a soul would seem to have mistaken its way, place, state, and company. It would be uneasy to itself and all about it. Christ is the Mediator of this new covenant, between God and man, to bring them together in this covenant; to keep them together; to plead with God for us, and to plead with us for God; and at length to bring God and his people together in heaven. This covenant is made firm by the blood of Christ sprinkled upon our consciences, as the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled upon the altar and the victim. This blood of Christ speaks in behalf of sinners; it pleads not for vengeance, but for mercy. See then that you refuse not his gracious call and offered salvation. See that you do not refuse Him who speaketh from heaven, with infinite tenderness and love; for how can those escape, who turn from God in unbelief or apostacy, while he so graciously beseeches them to be reconciled, and to receive his everlasting favour! God's dealing with men under the gospel, in a way of grace, assures us, that he will deal with the despisers of the gospel, in a way of judgment. We cannot worship God acceptably, unless we worship him with reverence and godly fear. Only the grace of God enables us to worship God aright. God is the same just and righteous God under the gospel as under the law. The inheritance of believers is secured to them; and all things pertaining to salvation are freely given in answer to prayer. Let us seek for grace, that we may serve God with reverence and godly fear.</body></html>
