A primary verb; to live.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Furthermore we have had fathers.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Furthermore we had the fathers of our flesh as chasteners </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to chasten us). The thought of the former verses has been, "He chastens as a lather." From likeness we here pass to contrast. The contrast drawn is between our natural parents and "the Father of spirits" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm" title="And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be wroth with all the congregation?">Numbers 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-16.htm" title="Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,">Numbers 27:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, said the LORD, which stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.">Zechariah 12:1</a>)--the Creator of all spirits, who is the Giver of life to all, who knows the spirit which He has made (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/94-9.htm" title="He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?">Psalm 94:9-10</a>) and can discipline it by His chastening.<p><span class= "bld">And live.</span>--Since the life of the spirit subsists only in union with Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - F<span class="cmt_word">urthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us</span> (more correctly, <span class="accented">we once had</span>, or, <span class="accented">we used to have</span>, <span class="accented">the fathers of our flesh as chasteners</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</span> This introduces an <span class="accented">&agrave; fortiori</span> argument. We are reminded of the days of our youth, while we were under parental discipline, and bore with it submissively: much more should we submit to the discipline of our heavenly Father, to whom we are as children under training all our life long! Commentators differ as to what is exactly meant by the contrast between "the fathers of <span class="accented">our flesh"</span> and "the Father <span class="accented">of spirits</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." Some (among moderns Delitzsch) find here a support to the theory of creationism as against traducianism; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the soul of each individual, as distinct from the body, is a new creation, not transmitted from the parents. This view would have more to go on than it has, were we justified in implying <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> ("<span class="accented">our</span> spirits," in opposition <span class="accented">to</span> "<span class="accented">our</span> flesh," preceding). But <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> seems evidently meant to be understood generally; and the expression (suggested probably by <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a> and Numbers 27:16, "The God of the spirits of all flesh") need imply only that, though God is the original Author of flesh as well as spirit, yet the latter, whether in man or otherwise existing, has in a peculiar sense its parentage from him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, "The LORD GOD formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>, "The Spirit of the LORD hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life"). Our earthly parents transmit to us our carnal existence; our spiritual part, in whatever mysterious way derived or inspired, is duo to our Divine parentage; and it is in respect of this that we are God's children and accountable to him. But, as has been intimated above, it is not human spirits only that are here in the writer's view. God is the Father of all "the spirits," whether in the flesh or not; all are of Divine parentage, for God himself is Spirit - <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). Chrysostom explains thus: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-11 The persevering obedience of faith in Christ, was the race set before the Hebrews, wherein they must either win the crown of glory, or have everlasting misery for their portion; and it is set before us. By the sin that does so easily beset us, understand that sin to which we are most prone, or to which we are most exposed, from habit, age, or circumstances. This is a most important exhortation; for while a man's darling sin, be it what it will, remains unsubdued, it will hinder him from running the Christian race, as it takes from him every motive for running, and gives power to every discouragement. When weary and faint in their minds, let them recollect that the holy Jesus suffered, to save them from eternal misery. By stedfastly looking to Jesus, their thoughts would strengthen holy affections, and keep under their carnal desires. Let us then frequently consider him. What are our little trials to his agonies, or even to our deserts? What are they to the sufferings of many others? There is a proneness in believers to grow weary, and to faint under trials and afflictions; this is from the imperfection of grace and the remains of corruption. Christians should not faint under their trials. Though their enemies and persecutors may be instruments to inflict sufferings, yet they are Divine chastisements; their heavenly Father has his hand in all, and his wise end to answer by all. They must not make light of afflictions, and be without feeling under them, for they are the hand and rod of God, and are his rebukes for sin. They must not despond and sink under trials, nor fret and repine, but bear up with faith and patience. God may let others alone in their sins, but he will correct sin in his own children. In this he acts as becomes a father. Our earthly parents sometimes may chasten us, to gratify their passion, rather than to reform our manners. But the Father of our souls never willingly grieves nor afflicts his children. It is always for our profit. Our whole life here is a state of childhood, and imperfect as to spiritual things; therefore we must submit to the discipline of such a state. When we come to a perfect state, we shall be fully reconciled to all God's chastisement of us now. God's correction is not condemnation; the chastening may be borne with patience, and greatly promote holiness. Let us then learn to consider the afflictions brought on us by the malice of men, as corrections sent by our wise and gracious Father, for our spiritual good.</body></html>
