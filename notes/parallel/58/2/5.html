"Angels are but ministering spirits, serving God in the cause of those who shall inherit salvation; <span class= "ital">for</span> not to angels is the world to come made subject." But the connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2-3</a>, is equally important: "the salvation that is now given has been proclaimed not by angels but by the Lord, and it is God Himself who works with the messengers of the Lord; <span class= "ital">for</span> not unto angels," &c. The word "salvation" binds together this section and the first. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Hath he not put in subjection.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">did He subject;</span> for the reference is to the passage quoted in the following verses, which is already in the writer's thought. "He:" God, speaking in the prophetic Scripture.<p><span class= "bld">The world to come.</span>--The same expression occurs in the English version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-5.htm" title="And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,">Hebrews 6:5</a>, but in the Greek "world" is represented by entirely different words. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>, the meaning is "inhabited earth," "world of man"; there, the word properly relates to time, "age." Is "the world <span class= "ital">to come</span>" still future, or is it here looked at from the Old Testament point of view? (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>.) The following verses (especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>) make it clear that the period referred to is that which succeeds the exaltation of Christ. We ourselves cannot but markedly distinguish the present stage of Messiah's kingdom from the future; but in the perspective of prophecy the two were blended. The thought of this kingdom amongst men has been present from the first verses of the Epistle onwards; hence, "whereof we speak."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Here the second division of the first section of the argument, according to the summary given above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), begins. But it is also connected logically with the interposed exhortation, the sequence of thought being as follows: "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?" - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (as an additional reason) <span class="cmt_word">not to angels</span> (but to the Son, as will be seen) <span class="cmt_word">did he</span> (God) <span class="cmt_word">subject the world to come, whereof we speak</span>, "The world to come (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>)" must be understood, in accordance with what has been said above in explanation of" the last of these days" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>), as referring to the age of the Messiah's kingdom foretold in prophecy. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> does not in itself necessarily imply futurity from the writer's standpoint though, according to what was said above, the complete fulfilment of the prophetic anticipation is to be looked for in the second advent, whatever earnest and foretaste of it there may be already under the gospel dispensation. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">sub</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) is the same as was used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>) in reference to the Son's advent, denoting the sphere of created things over which he should reign. And it is suitably used here with a view to the coming quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>, in which the primary idea is man's supremacy over the inhabited globe. The whole phrase may be taken to express the same idea as the "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-9 Neither the state in which the church is at present, nor its more completely restored state, when the prince of this world shall be cast out, and the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdom of Christ, is left to the government of the angels: Christ will take to him his great power, and will reign. And what is the moving cause of all the kindness God shows to men in giving Christ for them and to them? it is the grace of God. As a reward of Christ's humiliation in suffering death, he has unlimited dominion over all things; thus this ancient scripture was fulfilled in him. Thus God has done wonderful things for us in creation and providence, but for these we have made the basest returns.</body></html>
