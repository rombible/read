Before advancing to the next step in his argument, the writer pauses to enforce the duty which results from what has been already established. But (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>) the exhortation does not interrupt the thought, but rather serves as a connecting link. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm" title="For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.">Hebrews 2:5</a>.)<p>(1) Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard.--Better, <span class= "ital">to the things heard;</span> for this expression contains the complement of the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>. Both "speak" and "hear" are words which carry weighty emphasis in this Epistle. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-25.htm" title="See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven:">Hebrews 12:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-7.htm" title="Why (as the Holy Ghost said, To day if you will hear his voice,">Hebrews 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) Because of the supreme dignity of Him in whom at the last God speaks, men are bound to give the more earnest heed to the words spoken, whether heard by them from the Lord Himself or (as in this case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a>) from His servants.<p><span class= "bld">Lest at any time we should let them slip.</span>--This translation (first introduced by the Genevan Bible of 1560) substantially gives the sense, but inverts the figure presented in the Greek. The words must be rendered, <span class= "ital">lest possibly we drift away</span> (Wiclif, "lest perauenture we fleten awey"). It is the man that is in danger of being carried along by the current: unless the mind be held closely to the words that God has spoken, it must drift away from them, and from the salvation which they promise. There seems no foundation for the rendering of the margin, first given in the Genevan Testament of 1557.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - INTERPOSED EXHORTATION as explained above. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On this account</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on account of what has been seen of the SON'S superiority to the angels) <span class="cmt_word">we ought</span> (or, <span class="accented">we are bound</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>more abundantly to give heed to the things that we have heard</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gospel that has been preached to us in the Son), <span class="cmt_word">lest at any time</span> (or, <span class="accented">lest haply</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>we let them slip</span> (rather, <span class="accented">float past them</span>).

The allusion is to the danger, incidental to those to whom the Epistle was addressed, of failing to recognize the transcendent character of the gospel revelation, missing it through inadvertence, drifting away from it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 Christ being proved to be superior to the angels, this doctrine is applied. Our minds and memories are like a leaky vessel, they do not, without much care, retain what is poured into them. This proceeds from the corruption of our nature, temptations, worldly cares, and pleasures. Sinning against the gospel is neglect of this great salvation; it is a contempt of the saving grace of God in Christ, making light of it, not caring for it, not regarding either the worth of gospel grace, or the want of it, and our undone state without it. The Lord's judgments under the gospel dispensation are chiefly spiritual, but are on that account the more to be dreaded. Here is an appeal to the consciences of sinners. Even partial neglects will not escape rebukes; they often bring darkness on the souls they do not finally ruin. The setting forth the gospel was continued and confirmed by those who heard Christ, by the evangelists and apostles, who were witnesses of what Jesus Christ began both to do and to teach; and by the gifts of the Holy Ghost, qualified for the work to which they were called. And all this according to God's own will. It was the will of God that we should have sure ground for our faith, and a strong foundation for our hope in receiving the gospel. Let us mind this one thing needful, and attend to the Holy Scriptures, written by those who heard the words of our gracious Lord, and were inspired by his Spirit; then we shall be blessed with the good part that cannot be taken away.</body></html>
