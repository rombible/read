In accordance with the tone of the whole passage (in which the thought is not the reward of obedience, but the peril of neglect of duty), "the word" must denote divine <span class= "ital">commands</span> delivered by angels, and--as the close parallel presented by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-28.htm" title="He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:">Hebrews 10:28-29</a>, seems to prove--especially the commands of the Mosaic law. Hence this verse must be joined to the other passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>) which bring into relief the ministration of angels in the giving of the Law; and the nature of the argument of this Epistle gives special importance to the subject here. The only passage in the Pentateuch which can be quoted in illustration is <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> : "The Lord came from Sinai. . . . He came from amid myriads of holy ones." The Greek version (introducing a double rendering of the Hebrew) adds, "at His right hand were angels with Him;" and two of the Targums likewise speak of the "myriads of holy angels." <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm" title="The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.">Psalm 68:17</a> is difficult and obscure, but very possibly agrees with the passage just quoted in referring to angels as the attendants of Jehovah on the mount. Nowhere in the Old Testament is the thought carried beyond this point; but there are a few passages in Jewish writers which clearly show that such a ministration of angels as is here spoken of was a tenet of Jewish belief in the apostolic age. Philo, after saying that the angels have their name from reporting the commands of the Father to His children, and the wants of the children to the Father, adds: "We are unable to contain His exceeding and unalloyed benefits, if He Himself proffers them to us without employing others as His ministers." Much more important are the words of Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xv.</span> 5, ? 3), who introduces Herod as reminding the Jews that the noblest of the ordinances and the holiest of the things contained in the laws had been learnt by them from God through angels. Jewish writers quoted by Wetstein speak of the "angels of service" whom Moses had known from the time of the giving of the law; and, moreover, of the angel who, when Moses had through terror forgotten all that he had been taught during the forty days, delivered the law to him again. Such speculations are of interest as showing the place which this tenet held in Jewish doctrine and belief. Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a> (see Note there) this mediation of angels is adduced as a mark of the inferiority of the law; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>, where no such comparison is made, the contrast implied is between angels and men as givers of a law.<p><span class= "bld">Was stedfast</span>.--Rather, <span class= "ital">proved steadfast</span> or <span class= "ital">sure;</span> evidence of this was given by the punishment which overtook the transgressor, whether inflicted by the direct visitation of God or by human hands faithfully executing the divine will. Of the two words well rendered <span class= "ital">transgression</span> and <span class= "ital">disobedience, </span>the one points especially to the infraction of a positive precept, the other is more general: the former relates more commonly to "thou shalt not;" the latter rather to "thou shalt." The two words are here united, that every violation of the command may be included. The use of reward in a neutral or unfavourable sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-2.htm" title="Lift up yourself, you judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.">Psalm 94:2</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) is not uncommon in our older writers. (Comp. "the reward of a villain," in Shakespeare.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if the word</span> <span class="cmt_word">that was spoken through angels</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Law) <span class="cmt_word">was made</span> (or, <span class="accented">proved</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>steadfast</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> as explained in the next clause, ratified by just visitation of every transgression and disobedience), <span class="cmt_word">how shall we</span> (Christians) <span class="cmt_word">escape, if we neglect so great salvation?</span> The danger of neglect must be in proportion to the dignity of the revelation. The readers are now further reminded of the manner in which the gospel had been made known to them, and been ratified in their own experience, by way of enhancing the danger of disregarding it. <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (not the simple relative pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which denotes always, when so used, some general idea in the antecedent, equivalent to "being such as"), <span class="cmt_word">having at the first begun to be spoken through the Lord</span> (opposed to "the word spoken through angels" in the preceding verse. Its beginning was through the Lord himself, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ the SON, not through intermediate agency. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a special designation of Christ in the New Testament; and, though not in itself proving belief in his divinity, is significant as being constantly used also as a designation of God, and substituted in the LXX. for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>. It has a special emphasis here as expressing the majesty of Christ), <span class="cmt_word">was confirmed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, answering to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the former verse) <span class="cmt_word">unto us by them that heard</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the apostles and others who knew Christ in the flesh). Here the writer ranks himself among those who had not heard Christ himself; his doing which has been considered to afford a presumption against St. Paul having been the writer. For, though not an eyewitness of Christ's ministry, he is in the habit elsewhere of insisting strongly on his having received his "knowledge of the mystery," not from men or through men, but by direct revelation from the ascended Savior (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 12</a>). Still, he does not deny elsewhere that for the <span class="accented">facts</span> of Christ's history he was indebted to the testimony of others (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>, etc.). It was rather the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the mystery that he had learnt from heaven. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 Christ being proved to be superior to the angels, this doctrine is applied. Our minds and memories are like a leaky vessel, they do not, without much care, retain what is poured into them. This proceeds from the corruption of our nature, temptations, worldly cares, and pleasures. Sinning against the gospel is neglect of this great salvation; it is a contempt of the saving grace of God in Christ, making light of it, not caring for it, not regarding either the worth of gospel grace, or the want of it, and our undone state without it. The Lord's judgments under the gospel dispensation are chiefly spiritual, but are on that account the more to be dreaded. Here is an appeal to the consciences of sinners. Even partial neglects will not escape rebukes; they often bring darkness on the souls they do not finally ruin. The setting forth the gospel was continued and confirmed by those who heard Christ, by the evangelists and apostles, who were witnesses of what Jesus Christ began both to do and to teach; and by the gifts of the Holy Ghost, qualified for the work to which they were called. And all this according to God's own will. It was the will of God that we should have sure ground for our faith, and a strong foundation for our hope in receiving the gospel. Let us mind this one thing needful, and attend to the Holy Scriptures, written by those who heard the words of our gracious Lord, and were inspired by his Spirit; then we shall be blessed with the good part that cannot be taken away.</body></html>
