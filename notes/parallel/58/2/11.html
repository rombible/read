The thoughts of the last verse, therefore, are repeated here, with a change of figure; and again (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>) we note the brief reference to a subject which will be prominent in later chapters; see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm" title="Why Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.">Hebrews 13:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Are all of one</span>.--Of one Father.

Though His sonship is unique and infinitely exalted, He is not ashamed to own them as brethren.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For both he that sanctifieth</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and they that are sanctified</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "many sons" who are brought unto glory) <span class="cmt_word">are all of one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of God). The idea expressed here by the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to sanctify, may be determined by comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14, 29</a>; and Hebrews 13:12 (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9</a>. It is not the idea, to us most familiar, of moral sanctification through the Holy Spirit, but that of the redeemed being brought into a new relation to God, hallowed for "<span class="accented">glory</span>," through redemption; whence all Christians are called <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the equivalent in the LXX. of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>, which is applied to the hallowing of both the sacrifices and the people to God's service. As an atoning sacrifice, Christ thus hallowed himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-19.htm">John 17:19</a>), that thus he might hallow the "many sons." <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> must certainly be taken as referring to God, not (as some take it) to Abraham or Adam. For the necessity of the SON taking part of <span class="accented">flesh and blood</span> in order to accomplish the redemption is not introduced till ver. 14. So far the common fatherhood spoken of has been that of him "for whom are all things and by whom are all things," who, "in bringing many <span class="accented">sons</span> to glory," has perfected "the Captain of their salvation." The idea is that it was meet that the Captain should be perfected through human sufferings, <span class="accented">since</span> both he and the "many sons" are of one Divine Father; in their relation of sonship (with whatever difference of manner and degree) they are associated together. Be it observed, however, that it is not the <span class="accented">original</span> relation to God of the "Sanctifier" and the "sanctified," but their relation to him in the redemption, that is denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The common sonship does not consist in this, that <span class="accented">he</span> is Son by eternal generation and <span class="accented">they</span> by creation. It has been seen above that the term <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f35;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is net applied to Christ in this Epistle with reference to his eternal Being, but to his incarnation; and the human "sons" are not regarded as such till made so by redemption. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> rule the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The view is that the one Father sent the SON into the world to be the Firstborn of many sons. The expression, frequent in the Pentateuch, "I am he that sanctifieth," may be cited in illustration of the moaning of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the Messianic utterances of the Old Testament, to which, in accordance with the plan and purpose of the Epistle, reference is again made for proof. The point of the quotations that follow (vers. 12, 13) is that the Messiah, notwithstanding the position above the angels, shown above to be assigned to him, is represented also as associating himself with men as brethren, in dependence on one heavenly Father. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-13 Whatever the proud, carnal, and unbelieving may imagine or object, the spiritual mind will see peculiar glory in the cross of Christ, and be satisfied that it became Him, who in all things displays his own perfections in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. His way to the crown was by the cross, and so must that of his people be. Christ sanctifies; he has purchased and sent the sanctifying Spirit: the Spirit sanctifies as the Spirit of Christ. True believers are sanctified, endowed with holy principles and powers, set apart to high and holy uses and purposes. Christ and believers are all of one heavenly Father, who is God. They are brought into relation with Christ. But the words, his not being ashamed to call them brethren, express the high superiority of Christ to the human nature. This is shown from three texts of Scripture. See Ps 22:22; 18:2; Isa 8:18.</body></html>
