He was made a little (the rendering of the margin, "a little while," is much less probable) lower than angels, and He is crowned with glory. In one point we note an apparent departure from the sense of the Psalm, since words ("a little lower") which there denote dignity here denote humiliation. This difference is not essential; in each case it is the position of man that is signified, and our Lord's assumption of human nature must in any case be spoken of as a descent to a lower sphere. There is peculiar fitness in the use of the human name, Jesus, for Him in whom the Psalmist's words concerning man are literally fulfilled. It is noteworthy that we do not read, "We see all things put in subjection unto Jesus"--this would conflict with the truth stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-13.htm" title="From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.">Hebrews 10:13</a> : other words of the Psalm are substituted, which do not imply that the complete actual subjection is already accomplished. This exaltation of One is not a substitute for, but involves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and renders possible, the exaltation of the many. This is clear from the "not yet" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-8.htm" title="You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.">Hebrews 2:8</a>; and the same truth is brought out in a different form at the close of this verse. In the midst of this application of the words of Scripture to Jesus, the writer introduces his first reference to His death. The offence of the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-11.htm" title="And I, brothers, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.">Galatians 5:11</a>) was an ever-active force among Jews; this is present to the writer's mind throughout the Epistle. The words thus suddenly brought in here, reminding us that the exaltation of Christ was a reward for His obedience unto death (another echo of St. Paul--<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9-10</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>), prepare for the more detailed teaching of the following verses--<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>.<p>There is an apparent difficulty in the position of the last clause of the verse, "that He should taste death for every man." We cannot doubt that these words depend on those which immediately precede; and yet how can it be said that Jesus has been crowned with glory in order that He may "taste death for every man"? Almost all difficulty is removed if we consider that (to use Dean Alford's words) "it is on the triumphant issue of His sufferings that their efficacy depends." But it is impossible for the Christian to separate, even in thought, the one from the other--the sufferings from the certain triumph. We might, perhaps, say that it is only by a misuse of human analogies that we separate them even in <span class= "ital">time:</span> in the Gospel of St. John, at all events (if not in this very Epistle--see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>), we are taught that <span class= "ital">in His crucifixion</span> Jesus is exalted. This clause, then, brings us back to the thought of the glory reserved for man: through death the fulfilment of God's purpose might seem to be frustrated; through the death of Jesus on behalf of every man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>) it is fulfilled. The outline presented here is filled up in later chapters; there we shall read that man's inheritance was forfeited through sin, and that only through the virtue of a death which made atonement for sin is the promise again made sure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>). To "taste death" is a familiar Hebraism. If it has any special significance here, it would seem less natural to see (with Chrysostom) a reference to the short duration of our Saviour's death, than to understand the words as pointing to the actual taste of all the bitterness of death. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-4.htm" title="For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,">Hebrews 6:4-5</a>.)<p>One various reading it is impossible to pass by, though it is preserved in but two of our Greek MSS., and these of no early date. For "by the grace of God" many (apparently most) copies of the Epistle that were known to Origen read "apart from God." This reading was followed by others of the Fathers, and found its way into some manuscripts of early versions. The Nestorians gladly accepted words which to them seemed to teach that in suffering the man Jesus was apart from God. Origen and others understood the words differently, as meaning, <span class= "ital">taste death for every being</span> <span class= "ital">except God.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet. But when he said all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.">1Corinthians 15:27</a>.) A reading so widely known, which in later times has been favoured by as eminent a critic as Bengel, demanded notice, though it is almost certainly incorrect. No interpretation which the words admit yields a probable sense; on the other hand, the reference to "the grace of God" is full of significance. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm" title="God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?">Hebrews 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The phrase <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, where it occurs in this verse with reference to Christ's temporary humiliation, is by many taken to mean "for a little while," on the ground that this meaning suits best the application to Christ, though its most obvious meaning in the psalm (quoted in ver. 7) is, as in the A.V., "a little." The Greek in itself will bear either meaning; and if "a little" be, as it seems to be, the original meaning in the psalm, there is no necessity for supposing a departure from it. All that the writer need be supposed to intimate is that Christ, through his incarnation, took man's position as represented in the psalm. <span class="cmt_word">For the suffering of death</span>. So the A.V. renders, connecting the words by punctuation with the clause preceding; the idea being supposed to be that Christ was "made a little lower than the angels" <span class="accented">with a view to</span> the "suffering of death;" <span class="accented">i.e. because of</span> the "suffering of death" which he had to undergo. But the proper force of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with the accusative is better preserved, and a better meaning given to the passage, by connecting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> with the clause that follows, and translating, <span class="cmt_word">But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor</span>. His crowning was the consequence of his suffering; because of his suffering he was crowned; he won, as man, and in virtue of his human obedience unto death, his position of "glory and honor." Exactly the same idea is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, etc., where the purpose and result of Christ's suffering, here anticipated, are more explicitly set forth (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). This view, too, suits the drift of the passage before us, which is that human nature has been exalted in the Person of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">That he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man</span>. Two questions arise here: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As to the meaning of the expression, "that he should taste death," etc.; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as to the true reading, as well as the meaning, of the phrase translated "by the grace of God." As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, the clause is introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, followed by the subjunctive, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: and the construction of the sentence evidently connects it, not with <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, but with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> It is, "Because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, in order that for [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in behalf of] all he may taste of death." Now, the fact that the actual death was previous to the crowning suggests reference, not so much to it as to its permanent efficacy: and, further, the emphatic words are <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, as shown by their position in the sentence; and thus the idea seems to be, "In order that <span class="accented">for all</span> his tasting of death may be availing." And he may even be regarded as still tasting of death after his crowning, in the sense of knowing its taste through his human experience, and so perfectly sympathizing with mortal man (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>:15, and below in this chapter, vers. 14, 15). It is a further question whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> should be here taken as masculine, as in the A.V., or, like the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, as neuter, in the sense of "all creation." The latter rendering seems in itself more natural, though" all mankind" must be conceived as the main idea in the writer's view. At the same time, it is to be remembered how the redemption is elsewhere spoken of as availing for creation generally, for the restitution of universal harmony (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10, 20</a>, etc.). A further reason for understanding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the wider sense will appear in our examination of the phrase next to be considered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As to the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It is found in all existing manuscripts except in one uncial of the tenth century (Codex Uffenbach, cited as M), in a scholium to Codex 67, and in a codex of the Peschito. But, on the other hand, Origen, an earlier authority than any manuscript, speaks of the prevalent reading in his time being <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> being found only in some copies (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). Theodoret, Theodorus of Mopsuestia, and the Nestorians also read <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>: and the Latin Fathers, Ambrose, Fulgentius, and others, have <span class="accented">absque</span> as its equivalent. Jerome also speaks of the reading <span class="accented">absque</span>, but as occurring only "in quibusdam exemplaribus" - thus reversing in his day what Origen had said two centuries earlier as to the comparative prevalence of the two readings. The charge made by Marius Mercator, Theophylact, and OEcumenius against the Nestorians, that they had introduced the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> in support of their own views, is evidently untenable, since the testimony of Origen proves its prevalence long before the Nestorian controversy. It is, on the other hand, very probable that the use made of this reading by the Nestorians was a cause of the other being clung to by the orthodox, and being retained almost exclusively in the existing codices. And this probability greatly weakens the force of the evidence of the manuscripts as to the original reading. That both were very early ones is evident; but that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> was the original one is probable for two reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Origen testifies to its prevalence in his early day, and accepts it as at least equally probable with the other; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that transcribers were more likely to change the unusual and somewhat difficult <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> into the familiar and easy <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> than <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> Theodorus of Mopsuestia thus accounts for the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which he rejects very decidedly. He says that some persons, not observing the sequence of the passage, had laughably changed the true reading, because they did not understand it, into one that seemed easy to them. If <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> be the true reading, the meaning is plain enough; it expresses the view, often reiterated by St. Paul, of the whole work of redemption being "of grace." The objection to it, on internal grounds, is that the introduction of this view here seems flat and purposeless, as Theodorus of Mopsuestia forcibly contends in his argument against the reading. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>, then, being adopted, the question remains whether to connect <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (as Theodorus of Mopsuestia does, and as the Nestorians must have done) with <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, or with <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. If taken with the former, its purpose must be to exclude the Godhead in Christ from participation in the taste of death. Some further explain by reference to the cry from the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" But such reference does not suit the view above taken of the intended meaning o <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Taken with <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (as is rather suggested by the arrangement of the sentence, in which this is the emphatic phrase), it gives the meaning, "that for all except God he may taste of death" - this parenthetical exception of the Divine Being himself being similar to that which St. Paul sees reason for inserting in his application of the same psalm to Christ: <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>). So Origen takes it: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> "<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. Also Theodoret: <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. The latter Father explains the wide sense in which it follows that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> must be understood by referring to what St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>) of creation itself being delivered from the bondage of corruption through Christ, and to the rejoicing of angels in the salvation of man. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-9 Neither the state in which the church is at present, nor its more completely restored state, when the prince of this world shall be cast out, and the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdom of Christ, is left to the government of the angels: Christ will take to him his great power, and will reign. And what is the moving cause of all the kindness God shows to men in giving Christ for them and to them? it is the grace of God. As a reward of Christ's humiliation in suffering death, he has unlimited dominion over all things; thus this ancient scripture was fulfilled in him. Thus God has done wonderful things for us in creation and providence, but for these we have made the basest returns.</body></html>
