The only point of doubt is whether the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7</a> was included in the quotation, as in some very good ancient authorities it is absent from the text. The weight of external evidence is certainly in its favour; but it is easier to see how a scribe may have introduced the clause through his familiarity with the Psalm than to explain its omission if it stood in the original text of this Epistle. The Greek translation here faithfully represents the Hebrew, except in one point. For "a little lower than the angels," the Hebrew text has "a little less than God." The change (which is similar to that noticed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>) was probably introduced by the translators on a principle which we may often trace in their work--a wish to tone down expressions relating to the Deity which seemed strong or bold. In quoting the passage the writer does not depart from the rendering most familiar to the readers of the Greek Bible; but, though the clause in its altered form accords well with what had preceded the quotation, and, so to speak, more completely interweaves the words of the Psalm with the context in which they are here placed, yet no stress is laid on "angels." The argument of this section would not be affected materially if the true rendering of the Hebrew were restored. The eighth Psalm is an expression of amazement that God, who has "set His glory upon the heavens," should deign to remember man. Not only is He "mindful of man," but He has made him but "little less than God," "crowned him with honour," given him "dominion over" all His works. The original blessing pronounced on man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm" title="And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.">Genesis 1:28</a>) is clearly in the Psalmist's thought, and suggests his words. The language which here precedes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm" title="For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.">Hebrews 2:5</a>) and follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-8.htm" title="You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.">Hebrews 2:8</a>) shows that the last clause ("thou didst subject all things under his feet") bears the stress of the quotation. (That the same words are the groundwork of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24-28</a> is one of the most interesting coincidences between this Epistle and St. Paul.) It is easy to see, therefore, for what purpose these verses are here adduced. Not to angels is "the world to come" subjected: in the Scripture there are found words declaring that a divine decree has subjected all things to <span class= "ital">man.</span> How the thought is combined with the argument of the whole passage will be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>. A question at once arises: Did the meaning here assigned to the Psalm exist in David's thought? If not, on what principle does this application rest? David had in mind the words of the primal blessing, and probably did not himself think of more than those words seemed to imply. But the complete meaning of God's words can be learnt only when they are fulfilled in history. To Him who speaks in Scripture the material dominion was the symbol of a higher and a universal rule, to be fulfilled in the Son of Man when the fulness of time should come. The Psalm is not directly Messianic,--it relates to man; but it is through the Man Christ Jesus that it receives its complete fulfilment for mankind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But one in a certain place</span> (or, <span class="accented">somewhere</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>testified, saying</span>. The phrase does not imply uncertainty as to the passage cited. It is one used by Philo when exact reference is not necessary. It is equivalent to "but we do find the following testimony with regard to <span class="accented">man</span>." We say <span class="accented">to man</span>; for the eighth psalm, from which the citation comes, evidently refers to man generally; not primarily or distinctively to the Messiah. Nor does it appear to have been ranked by the Jews among the Messianic psalms. It would be arbitrary interpretation to assign to it (as some have done) an original meaning of which it contains no signs. This being the case, how are we to explain its application to Christ, which is not confined to this passage, but is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>? There is no real difficulty. True, the psalm speaks of man only; but it is of man regarded according to the ideal position assigned to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, as God's vicegerent. Man as he now is (says the writer of this Epistle) does not fulfill this ideal; but Christ, the Son of man, and the Exalter of humanity, does. Therefore in him we find the complete fulfillment of the meaning of the psalm. If it be still objected that the application (in which sovereignty over all created things is inferred) transcends the meaning of the psalm, which refers to this earth only - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 6. of the psalm being taken in a wider sense than seems justified by the following verses, which confine the application to earthly creatures, it may be replied <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the idea of the psalmist is to be gathered, not only from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, which he quotes, but, further, from the whole purport of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, of which the psalm is a lyrical expression, including the conception of man having been made in God's image, and invested with a sovereignty little short of Divine; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, if the application does transcend the scope of the psalm, it was open to an inspired writer of the New Testament thus to extend its meaning, as seen in the new light from Christ. Taking the latter view, we have but to put the argument thus, in order to see its force and legitimacy: In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>. (read in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, on which it is founded) a position is assigned to man which at present he does not realize; but its whole idea is fulfilled, <span class="accented">and more than fulfilled</span>, in Christ. It is to be observed that the original reference of the psalm to man generally is not only evident in itself, but also essential to the writer's argument. For he is now passing from the view set forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>, of what the SON is in himself, to the further view of his participation in humanity, in order to exalt humanity to the position forfeited through sin; and thus (as has been shown in the foregoing summary) to lead up to the idea of his being our <span class="accented">great High Priest. <span class="cmt_word"></span>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span> In the psalm this exclamation comes after a contemplation of the starry heavens, which had impressed the psalmist's mind with a sense of God's transcendent glory. In contrast with this glory, man's insignificance and unworthiness occur to him, as they have similarly occurred to many; but, at the same time, he thought of the high position assigned to man in the account of the creation, on which position he next enlarges. He asks how it can be that man, being what he is now, can be of such high estate. Thus the Epistle carries out truly the idea of the psalm, which is that man's appointed position in the scale of things is beyond what he seems now to realize. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-9 Neither the state in which the church is at present, nor its more completely restored state, when the prince of this world shall be cast out, and the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdom of Christ, is left to the government of the angels: Christ will take to him his great power, and will reign. And what is the moving cause of all the kindness God shows to men in giving Christ for them and to them? it is the grace of God. As a reward of Christ's humiliation in suffering death, he has unlimited dominion over all things; thus this ancient scripture was fulfilled in him. Thus God has done wonderful things for us in creation and providence, but for these we have made the basest returns.</body></html>
