Having spoken in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a> of our Lord's assumption of human nature, the writer in these words assigns the reason: "For surely it is not of angels that He taketh hold, but He taketh hold of the seed of Abraham." Though the words "take hold," which occur twice in the verse, probably cannot directly signify "help" (as is often maintained), they distinctly suggest laying hold for the sake of giving help; and a beautiful illustration may be found in some of the Gospel narratives of our Lord's works of healing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-23.htm" title="And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands on him, he asked him if he saw ought.">Mark 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-4.htm" title="And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;">Luke 14:4</a>). It is probable that the language used here is derived from the Old Testament. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-9.htm" title="Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, said the Lord.">Hebrews 8:9</a>, a quotation from Jeremiah 31, we read, "In the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt." <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8-9</a>, however, is perhaps a still closer parallel (for the word used in the Greek version is very similar, and no doubt expresses the same meaning): "Thou Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend; thou of whom I have taken hold from the ends of the earth." If the writer had these verses in his thought, it is hardly necessary to inquire why he chooses the expression "seed of Abraham," instead of one of (apparently) wider meaning, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7-8</a>, might seem to require. But even apart from this passage of Isaiah, and the natural fitness of such a phrase in words addressed to Jews, we may doubt if any other language would have been equally expressive. For as to the <span class= "ital">means, </span>it was by becoming a child of Abraham that the Saviour "took hold of" our race to raise it up; and as to the <span class= "ital">purpose, </span>St. Paul teaches us that "the seed of Abraham" includes all who inherit Abraham's faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For verily</span>, etc. The A.V.

Translate, therefore, observing the position of the substantives before the verbs, <span class="cmt_word">For not, I ween, angels cloth he lay hold of</span> (<span class="accented">to succor them</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>but the seed of Abraham he doth lay hold of.</span> The allusion is to its being the human "children of promise," and not angels, that are denoted in prophecy as being, and acknowledged to be, the object of the Messianic redemption. The expression, "the seed of Abraham," is, of course, not intended to exclude the Gentiles: it is appropriately used in reference to the Messianic promises of the Old Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-18.htm">Genesis 23:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>): and the extension of its meaning to "all them that believe" would be as familiar to the first readers of the Epistle as to us (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11, 16</a>). The conclusion of ver. 17 (which repeats virtually what has been alleged before, after reason given) now naturally follows: <span class="cmt_word">Whence it behooved him in all things to be assimilated to his brethren</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the race which was the object of his redemptive succor. But, further, why the need of this entire assimilation, to the extent of participation in suffering unto death? <span class="cmt_word">That he might become a merciful</span> (or, <span class="accented">compassionate</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>high priest, in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people</span>. It was that he might be fully constituted as the High Priest of humanity. Here, according to the manner of the Epistle, the view of priesthood, to be afterwards set forth at length, is briefly hinted. It is taken up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, after the conclusion that Christ is man's High Priest has been reached by another line of argument (see preceding summary). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>. one of the essentials of a true high priest (whose office is to mediate for man in things pertaining to God) is set forth as being that he should be of the same race and nature with those for whom he mediates, and able in all respects to sympathize with them: and this view is here foreshadowed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 The angels fell, and remained without hope or help. Christ never designed to be the Saviour of the fallen angels, therefore he did not take their nature; and the nature of angels could not be an atoning sacrifice for the sin of man. Here is a price paid, enough for all, and suitable to all, for it was in our nature. Here the wonderful love of God appeared, that, when Christ knew what he must suffer in our nature, and how he must die in it, yet he readily took it upon him. And this atonement made way for his people's deliverance from Satan's bondage, and for the pardon of their sins through faith. Let those who dread death, and strive to get the better of their terrors, no longer attempt to outbrave or to stifle them, no longer grow careless or wicked through despair. Let them not expect help from the world, or human devices; but let them seek pardon, peace, grace, and a lively hope of heaven, by faith in Him who died and rose again, that thus they may rise above the fear of death. The remembrance of his own sorrows and temptations, makes Christ mindful of the trials of his people, and ready to help them. He is ready and willing to succour those who are tempted, and seek him. He became man, and was tempted, that he might be every way qualified to succour his people, seeing that he had passed through the same temptations himself, but continued perfectly free from sin. Then let not the afflicted and tempted despond, or give place to Satan, as if temptations made it wrong for them to come to the Lord in prayer. Not soul ever perished under temptation, that cried unto the Lord from real alarm at its danger, with faith and expectation of relief. This is our duty upon our first being surprised by temptations, and would stop their progress, which is our wisdom.</body></html>
