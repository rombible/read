This designation of human nature on its material side is found four times in the New Testament, and is extremely common in Jewish writers.<p>The emphasis of the following statement is note. worthy: "He Himself also in like manner took part of the same things."

The comment on these words will be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>; for it was as the lord of sin, which was the cause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>) and the sting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm" title="The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.">1Corinthians 15:56</a>) of death, that the devil held dominion over death (or, as the words might mean, wielded the power possessed by death). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm" title="He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning.

Combined with this is the thought which runs through this chapter--the assimilation of the Redeemer to the redeemed in the conditions of His earthly life. By meeting death Himself, He vanquishes and destroys death for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of</span> (literally, <span class="accented">have been, made partakers of</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so made as to share alike), <span class="cmt_word">blood and flesh</span> (this is the order of the words, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, according to the great preponderance of authority; Delitzsch sees in it a reference to "the blood-shedding for the sake of which the Savior entered into the fellowship of bodily life with us")<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>he also himself likewise</span> (rather, <span class="accented">iv, like manner</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with "the children") <span class="cmt_word">took part in the same</span>; that through death he might destroy (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, equivalent to "bring to nought," "render impotent as though not existing;" the word is frequent with St. Paul) <span class="cmt_word">him that had</span> (or, <span class="accented">has</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from bondage) <span class="cmt_word">all those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage</span>. Here the purpose of the Incarnation is set forth as requiring the complete association of the SON with human brethren to which prophecy had pointed. But more is now declared than the prophecies so far quoted have implied; and thus is introduced (by way of anticipation, as is usual in the Epistle) the doctrine of atonement, which is to be dwelt on afterwards. For the object of Christ's becoming one of us is now further said to be that by <span class="accented">dying</span> he might effect <span class="accented">redemption.</span> The "children" in ver. 14 are the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the type in Isaiah, fulfilled in the "many sons" to be "sanctified" and brought to glory. (We may observe, by the way, the difference between the words used of their participation in human nature and of Christ's - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>: the aorist in the latter case expresses his sharing what was not his before, and so distinctly implies his pre-existence.) For understanding' the account here given of the purpose of the Incarnation, we must remember that <span class="accented">death</span>, originally announced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>) as the penalty of transgression, is regarded in the New Testament (notably by St. Paul) as the sign of the continual dominion of sin over the human race. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12, 15</a> the mere fact that all men "from Adam to Moses" had died is adduced as sufficient proof that all were under condemnation as sinners. Whatever further idea is implied in the word "death " - such as alienation from God in whom is life eternal, or any "blackness of darkness" thereupon ensuing in the world beyond the grave - of man's subjection or liability to all this his natural death is regarded as the sign. It is to be remembered, too, that "the devil," through whom it was that sin first entered, and death through sin, is revealed to us generally as the representative of evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), and, as such, the primeval manslayer (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), with power given him over death, the penalty of sin, as long as man remains in his dominion, unredeemed. Till redemption cast a new light upon the gloom of death, man was all his life long in fear of it; its shadow was upon him from his birth; it loomed ever before him as a passing into darkness, unrelieved by hope. We know well how the hopeless dismalness of death was a commonplace with the classical poets, and how, even now, the natural man shrinks from it as the last great evil. But Christ, human, yet sinless, died for all mankind, and, so dying, wrested from the devil his power over death, and emancipated believers from their state of "bondage" (as to which, see below). On particular expressions in this passage we may remark: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That, "having the power of death," which has been variously interpreted, may be taken in the usual sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, viz. "having power, or dominion, <span class="accented">over."</span> Satan has had the dominion over death allowed him because of human sin. And it may be observed that elsewhere, not only death, but other woes that flesh is heir to - its precursors and harbingers - are attributed to Satanic agency (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-16.htm">Luke 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Christ is not here said to have as yet abolished death itself; only to have rendered impotent him that had the power of it; for natural death still "reigns," though to believers it has no "sting." In the end (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>) death itself will be destroyed. In one passage, indeed, it is spoken of by St. Paul as already abolished (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>); but this is in the way of anticipation: death is already vanquished and disarmed to believers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The bondage (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) spoken of is the condition of unredeemed man, often so designated by St. Paul. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. and 8, where man's bondage (felt when conscience is awake) to "the law of sin in the members," and his emancipation from it through faith, are described; and especially Romans 8:15, 16, 17 ("For ye have not received the spirit of <span class="accented">bondage</span> again to <span class="accented">fear</span>," etc.), as elucidating <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span>The word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, followed this passage by the genitive (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), expresses here more than "<span class="accented">liability</span> to;" it implies present implication, equivalent to "in hold to." The A.V., "<span class="accented">subject to</span>," expresses the idea adequately. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 The angels fell, and remained without hope or help. Christ never designed to be the Saviour of the fallen angels, therefore he did not take their nature; and the nature of angels could not be an atoning sacrifice for the sin of man. Here is a price paid, enough for all, and suitable to all, for it was in our nature. Here the wonderful love of God appeared, that, when Christ knew what he must suffer in our nature, and how he must die in it, yet he readily took it upon him. And this atonement made way for his people's deliverance from Satan's bondage, and for the pardon of their sins through faith. Let those who dread death, and strive to get the better of their terrors, no longer attempt to outbrave or to stifle them, no longer grow careless or wicked through despair. Let them not expect help from the world, or human devices; but let them seek pardon, peace, grace, and a lively hope of heaven, by faith in Him who died and rose again, that thus they may rise above the fear of death. The remembrance of his own sorrows and temptations, makes Christ mindful of the trials of his people, and ready to help them. He is ready and willing to succour those who are tempted, and seek him. He became man, and was tempted, that he might be every way qualified to succour his people, seeing that he had passed through the same temptations himself, but continued perfectly free from sin. Then let not the afflicted and tempted despond, or give place to Satan, as if temptations made it wrong for them to come to the Lord in prayer. Not soul ever perished under temptation, that cried unto the Lord from real alarm at its danger, with faith and expectation of relief. This is our duty upon our first being surprised by temptations, and would stop their progress, which is our wisdom.</body></html>
