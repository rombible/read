For thus to make sufferings the path to His kingdom was worthy of God, for whose glory and through whose power all things exist; who as Creator commands all agencies, and who cannot but do that which will subserve His glory. If the means at which men wondered were chosen by God, no one may doubt their supreme fitness for the end. In what this fitness consisted the following words partially explain.<p><span class= "bld">In bringing</span>.--It is doubtful whether the Greek word should not be rendered, <span class= "ital">having brought.</span> With this translation we must certainly explain the words on the same principle as the past tenses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7-8</a>. As in the divine counsels all things <span class= "ital">were</span> subjected to man, with the same propriety it may be said that God <span class= "ital">had</span> brought many sons to glory when the Saviour suffered and died.<p><span class= "bld">Many sons.</span>--The new thought here introduced is of great importance in the argument. The divine purpose is to bring many sons (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>) unto glory--the glory already spoken of as reserved for man--through His Son, who has Himself received this glory that He may make it theirs.<p><span class= "bld">Captain.</span>--This word occurs in three other places. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a> it bears its original meaning, "Leader<span class= "ital">"</span> ("a Leader and a Saviour"); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a> the idea of "leading the way" has passed into that of origination. In the present case, also, <span class= "ital">Author</span> is the best rendering; but in a context which so distinctly presents our Lord as taking on Himself the conditions of man's lot, and so passing into the glory which He wins for man, the primary thought of <span class= "ital">leading</span> must not be entirely set aside. It is as the Author of salvation that He is made perfect through sufferings. Three aspects of this truth are presented in the Epistle. By His suffering unto death He "bare the sins of many" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>); He offered the sacrifice of a perfect obedience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>); He was enabled to be a perfect representative of man. This last thought pervades the remaining verses of the chapter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it became him, for whom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, with accusative) <span class="cmt_word">are all things, and through whom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with genitive) <span class="cmt_word">are all things</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God), <span class="cmt_word">in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span> This refers to what was said in the preceding verse, of Christ having been crowned with glory on account of his suffering of death, and of his tasting death for all. That he should attain through human suffering even unto death to his own perfected state of glory, as being the Leader of human sons whom the one Father of all would bring to glory, was a design worthy of him for whom and through whom are all things - suitable to what we conceive of him and of his way of working. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> is used in the same sense not infrequently in the LXX. It is probably used here with some view to "<span class="accented">the</span> offence of the cross," which might still linger in the minds of some of the Hebrew Christians. In the argument that follows, supported still by reference to Old Testament anticipations, the writer not only meets possible objections lingering in the Hebrew mind, but also carries on and completes the view of the SON which it is his purpose to inculcate, leading up (as aforesaid) to the final position of his being the High Priest of humanity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-13 Whatever the proud, carnal, and unbelieving may imagine or object, the spiritual mind will see peculiar glory in the cross of Christ, and be satisfied that it became Him, who in all things displays his own perfections in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. His way to the crown was by the cross, and so must that of his people be. Christ sanctifies; he has purchased and sent the sanctifying Spirit: the Spirit sanctifies as the Spirit of Christ. True believers are sanctified, endowed with holy principles and powers, set apart to high and holy uses and purposes. Christ and believers are all of one heavenly Father, who is God. They are brought into relation with Christ. But the words, his not being ashamed to call them brethren, express the high superiority of Christ to the human nature. This is shown from three texts of Scripture. See Ps 22:22; 18:2; Isa 8:18.</body></html>
