On the several expressions used we remark: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The initiatory <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> connects the sentence logically with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 1, and thus retains its usual sense of "for." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The form of comparison in the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>, is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>, where the account of Christ's superiority to <span class="accented">angels</span> began (on which see <span class="accented">supra</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The "glory" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>) here assigned to Christ is the" glory and honor" spoken of above as attained by him in consequence of his human obedience (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>, "because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor"). This, rather than "the glory he had with the Father before the world was" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>), is suggested by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as well as by the drift of the preceding chapters. We may suppose also a reference, in contrast, to the transitory "glory" on the countenance of Moses (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), which is contrasted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>.) with the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> in Christ. We observe, further, that in the latter part of the verse <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> is substituted for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, as more suitable to the mundane comparison of a house and its builder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> may include the idea of fitting up and furnishing a house as well as building it. But what is the drift of the intended argument? It is usual, with the Fathers generally, to suppose that Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is intended to be denoted as the Builder or Establisher of the house in which Hoses was a servant, and that the argument is that he, as such, is necessarily greater than the servant, who was but a part of the house, or household, thus established. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it is to be observed, may include in its meaning the <span class="accented">familia</span>, as well as the house itself, as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> may include the idea of constituting the whole establishment (cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, "whose house we are"). Among moderns, Hofmann and Delitzsch deny this identification of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: against which there are the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The SON has not been represented so far in the Epistle as the <span class="accented">originator</span> of the economy of redemption. Notwithstanding distinct intimations of his eternal proexistent Deity (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2, 10</a>), it has been as the Messiah, the Apostle and High Priest, manifested in time, and passing through humanity to glory, that he has been regarded in the preceding argument. Nor is there any proof here adduced of his being the <span class="accented">Builder</span> of the "house," so as to justify the conclusion on this ground of his glory being greater than that of Moses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("has been counted worthy of") suggests (as has been already remarked) refer once to the glory won by him, "on account of the suffering of death," rather than to his pristine glory as the Divine Builder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Elsewhere in the New Testament, when the Church is referred to under the figure of a house, it is spoken of as <span class="accented">God's</span> building (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-21.htm">Hebrews 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). It is never spoken of as Christ's. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The wording of ver. 3 does not necessitate the identification of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means "so far as;" it implies only that the glory of Christ is greater than that of Moses, <span class="accented">in proportion as</span> the honor of the builder is greater than that of the house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The identification increases the difficulty of understanding the relevance to the argument of ver. 4, of which more will be said presently. Taking, then, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> to denote God the Father, we may state the argument thus: God is the Builder, or Founder, of his own house. Christ has been already shown to be his SON, associated with him in dignity and power, and, as such, Lord over his Father's house. Moses, on the other hand, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, was but a servant in God's house. As, then, the Founder is to the house, so is the Son and Lord to a servant in it; the Son partaking of the glory of the Founder; the servant only of that of the house in which he serves. According to this view of the argument, the premises have been established, and the conclusion follows; the relation of Christ to the Builder of the house has been set forth in the preceding chapter, and may be now assumed; that of Moses is sufficiently shown by the quotation from the Pentateuch. Thus also vers. 5 and 6 are found to carry out naturally the idea here introduced, instead of unexpectedly starting a different one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, the Messenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which we profess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ, the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest. As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls. Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and serious thoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a high opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but a type of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church, his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant; Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and Sovereign Ruler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in the ways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end. Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest more wisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.</body></html>
