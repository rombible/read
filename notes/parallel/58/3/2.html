"It is the Lord that made Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt." As there Samuel speaks of the raising up of Moses and Aaron, constituted by God deliverers of the people; so here our thought must rest on Him who constituted Jesus "Apostle and High Priest."<p><span class= "bld">As also Moses.</span>--These words, which give the key to the following verses, are quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>, where Moses is placed in contrast with prophets in Israel to whom the Lord will make Himself known by vision or dream. "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. With him will I speak mouth to mouth." The "house" or household is God's. people Israel. To others will God reveal Himself in various ways in regard to the many parts of the house, the many concerns of the household. Throughout the whole house Moses was the recipient of the divine commands, and was faithful--"faithful" (as one of the Targums paraphrases), "as chief of the chiefs of my court."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who was faithful</span> (or, <span class="accented">as being faithful</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to him that appointed</span> (literally, <span class="accented">made</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>him, as also Moses was in all his house</span>. The reference is to what was said of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house," and serves aptly to introduce the intended comparison of Christ with him. In respect of faithfulness to him who constituted him in his office, Christ resembles Moses; in respect to his office itself, it is to be shown that he is far above him. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "his house" means <span class="accented">God's</span> house, as' is plain from the text cited, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the house of him who appointed him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that "in all his house" has reference to Moses only, not to Christ; for the main point of what follows is that Christ is <span class="accented">over</span> God's house, not in it, as Moses was. As to the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (translated in A.V. "appointed "), it may have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>, where the LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, the Hebrew verb being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span>, which seems to mean in this case "constitute," not "create" (so Gesenius). The preceding words, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, though it is not necessary to supply them as understood, may be taken here to rule the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (cf. for a similar use of the verb without a second accusative following, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. Thus the Arian inference from the word, that Christ is represented as a creature, is groundless. Nor need reference be supposed to his human birth or conception, the <span class="accented">temporalis generatio</span> of the man Jesus (Athanasius, Ambrose, and other Fathers). Certainly not to his eternal generation (as Bleek and Lunemann); such reference is foreign to the idea of the passage; nor could the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with any propriety be so used. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, the Messenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which we profess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ, the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest. As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls. Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and serious thoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a high opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but a type of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church, his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant; Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and Sovereign Ruler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in the ways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end. Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest more wisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.</body></html>
