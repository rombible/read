Either <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a> is parenthetical, so that this verse emphasises the reference to "today" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-13.htm" title="But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.">Hebrews 3:13</a>; or the thought of the writer is that we must "hold fast the beginning of our confidence" <span class= "ital">in the presence of</span> this divine warning--whilst day by day these words are addressed to us anew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While it is said, Today</span>, etc. Commentators have found unnecessary difficulty in determining the connection of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Many, taking the words as the beginning of a new sentence, have been at pains to discover the apodosis to them. Cbrysostom, Grotius, Rosenmuller, and others find it in <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1</a>; notwithstanding the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, which seems evidently to introduce a new sentence, and the long parenthesis which, on this supposition, intervenes. Others find it in <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("harden not your hearts"), in the middle of the citation of ver. 16, as if the writer of the Epistle adopted these words as his own. Delitzsch finds it in ver. 16, taken as an interrogation (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span>: see below); thus: "When it is said, Today... harden not your hearts as in the provocation,... who did provoke? Nay, did not all?" The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> he accounts for by its idiomatic use found in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-31.htm">Acts 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>, conveying the sense of the English, "<span class="accented">Why</span>, who did provoke?" But this use of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, obvious in the texts adduced as parallel, would be forced here; the structure of the sentence does not easily lend itself to it. Still, this is the view taken by Tholuck, Bleek, De Wette, Lunemann, and others, as well as Delitzsch. But, notwithstanding such weighty support, difficulties are surely best avoided by taking <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not as commencing a new sentence, but in connection with ver. 14 preceding, as it seems most natural to take it in the absence of any connecting particle to mark a new proposition. In this case the translation of the A.V. gives a fully satisfactory sense: "If we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end, while it is still being said, To-day," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (as in ver. 13) "so long as it is called Today." Ebrard, Alford, and others, taking the same view of the connection of the words, prefer the translation, "In that it is said." But the other seems more in accordance with the thought pervading the passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-19 The saints' privilege is, they are made partakers of Christ, that is, of the Spirit, the nature, graces, righteousness, and life of Christ; they are interested in all Christ is, in all he has done, or will do. The same spirit with which Christians set out in the ways of God, they should maintain unto the end. Perseverance in faith is the best evidence of the sincerity of our faith. Hearing the word often is a means of salvation, yet, if not hearkened to, it will expose more to the Divine wrath. The happiness of being partakers of Christ and his complete salvation, and the fear of God's wrath and eternal misery, should stir us up to persevere in the life of obedient faith. Let us beware of trusting to outward privileges or professions, and pray to be numbered with the true believers who enter heaven, when all others fail because of unbelief. As our obedience follows according to the power of our faith, so our sins and want of care are according to the prevailing of unbelief in us.</body></html>
