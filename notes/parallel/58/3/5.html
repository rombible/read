Moses was "in God's house;" however exalted his position, he was in the house as a servant. The Greek word used here does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, but is taken from the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>. There is nothing special in the Hebrew word in that place, but the translators seem to have felt that "bond-servant" was less suitable in such a context than "attendant" or "minister." The object of his service was that he might bear "testimony of the things that should hereafter be spoken." Are we to understand by these the divine commands that would from time to time be given to Moses? If so, then the statement "Moses was faithful" must be regarded as a pure quotation, equivalent to "Moses was at that time declared faithful." This does not seem probable. If, however, the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a> are taken as descriptive of the whole life of Moses, his "witness" must relate to the things spoken "in these last days;" of these, by his writings, his acts, his life, Moses bore constant witness. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-26.htm" title="Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.">Hebrews 11:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-46.htm" title="For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.">John 5:46</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) The latter interpretation is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>, in which the name given to our Lord is not Jesus, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>, but <span class= "ital">Christ.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterwards to be spoken; but Christ, as Son over his house</span>. We have already anticipated the explanation of this passage, which, according to the view taken above, is a setting forth of the distinction between Christ and Moses intended from the first; that of one being "Son over," the other but "servant <span class="accented">in</span>," the house of God. The rendering of the A.V., "his own house," in ver. 6, where Christ is spoken of, is not justifiable. It is true that we have no means of knowing whether <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> was intended, and that even <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> might, according to the usage of Hellenistic Greek, refer to Christ; but if the writer had so intended it, he might easily have avoided ambiguity by writing <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, etc. He has not done so; and, therefore, it is most natural to take "<span class="accented">his</span> house" in the same sense throughout the passage; viz. as" <span class="accented">God's</span> house," referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, whence the expression is taken. We observe further that "the things that were afterwards to be spoken (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" must be taken as denoting the future "speaking" of God to man "in his SON" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>); not, as some interpret, the speaking through Moses himself in the Law. Moses was inferior to Christ, not only in respect to his personal position as a servant, but also in respect to his work as such; which was only to testify beforehand, typically and prophetically, to a fuller revelation to come. <span class="cmt_word">Whose house we are</span>. Here begins the transition to the warning intended when the "holy brethren" were first called on to "consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession," who has now been seen to be so much greater than Moses. We Christians constitute this completed "house of God," over which Christ reigns as Son; if only warned by the example of the Israelites under Moses, we forfeit not our higher calling. This condition is expressed by <span class="cmt_word">If we hold fast the confidence</span> (or, <span class="accented">our confidence</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and the rejoicing</span> (rather, <span class="accented">boast</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> our) <span class="cmt_word">hope firm unto the end</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> (often rendered "boldness;" see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 35</a>) is the confidence felt by assured believers; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is the boast thereupon ensuing. This word (as also <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is often used by St. Paul (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-2.htm">Romans 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>: 9:15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-14.htm">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-3.htm">2 Corinthians 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-26.htm">Philippians 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>). Its proper meaning is not (as is by many sup- posed) the <span class="accented">materies gloriandi</span>, but the uttered boast itself (see note on 1 Corinthians 5:6, in the 'Speaker's Commentary'). The con- eluding words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, are omitted in the Codex Vatican, and, notwithstanding the preponderance of authority in their favor, <span class="accented">may</span> have been interpolated (as is supposed by Mill, Tischendorf, Alford, and Delitzsch) from ver. 14, especially as the reading is not <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, so as to agree with the substantive immediately preceding, but <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as in ver. 14. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, the Messenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which we profess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ, the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest. As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls. Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and serious thoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a high opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but a type of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church, his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant; Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and Sovereign Ruler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in the ways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end. Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest more wisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.</body></html>
