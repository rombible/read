In particular, the contents of the second chapter are gathered up in this verse, almost every word of which recalls some previous statement or result.<p><span class= "bld">Holy brethren.</span>--United in one brotherhood in virtue of a common sonship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>) and of a common brotherhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a>) with Jesus, Him "that sanctifieth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Partakers.</span>--Through Him who "took part" of our earthly nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>) we are partakers of a "heavenly calling" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>) as God's sons.<p><span class= "bld">The Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus.</span>--The best MSS. omit "Christ"; and it is impossible not to feel how fitly the personal name "Jesus" is used after the later verses of Hebrews 2. Here only is the name Apostle directly given to our Lord; but the thought is present in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a>, and in the many passages in which Jesus designates Himself as the Sent of God, using the word from which <span class= "ital">Apostle</span> is derived (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-17.htm" title="For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.">John 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>, <span class= "ital">et al</span>.; especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-18.htm" title="As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.">John 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a>). There is very little difference between <span class= "ital">Apostle</span> and <span class= "ital">Prophet, </span>thus applied; but the one brings into relief the mission, the other the office and position. Each presents a thought complementary of that contained in high priest: "as Apostle Jesus pleads the cause of God with us; as High Priest He pleads our cause with God" (Bengel). The next verse renders it probable that the two terms contain a reference to the special mission of Moses and the priesthood of Aaron; our Christian confession looks to <span class= "ital">One</span> mediator.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> is ill supported, and to be rejected from the text). Reference to what has gone before is perceptible throughout this verse. The persons addressed are "holy," as being among the "sanctified" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>); "brethren," as being, with the writer, in this relation to Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11, 12, 13, 17</a>); their calling is a heavenly one, being from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>) and to heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Jesus is their" Apostle," as having been sent into the world, as above set forth, from God; their "High Priest," as implied, though not distinctly expressed, at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>, which led up to the idea. "Jesus" is added at the end in apposition, so as to fix attention on him, as the bearer of these titles, who was known by that name in the flesh. On the title "Apostle," we may observe that, though it is nowhere else in the New Testament applied to Christ, yet its idea with respect to him is frequent both in this Epistle and elsewhere (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-48.htm">Luke 9:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3, 18</a>, etc.). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "confession;" in the A.V., "profession") is generally used for the Christian's avowal of his faith before men (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>). The genitive here depends on both the preceding substantives, its force probably being that Jesus, as Apostle and High Priest, is the <span class="accented">object</span> of our confession of faith. On Jesus, then, being such, the readers are called to fix earnestly their mental gaze, and in doing so take further note of his superiority to Moses, which is the subject of what follows. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, the Messenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which we profess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ, the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest. As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls. Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and serious thoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a high opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but a type of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church, his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant; Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and Sovereign Ruler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in the ways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end. Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest more wisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.</body></html>
