Whereas Moses was faithful as a servant in this house of God, Christ was faithful as a son set over His Father's house. The antithesis is complete: the one is a servant for witness, the other a Son having a natural right to rule. The concluding words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5</a> have no formal answer here, but the contrast is not the less distinctly expressed. The name Christ (which here occurs for the first time) is in this Epistle never a mere name: it contains implicitly the thought that all that to which Moses bore witness has reached its fulfilment now. Christ has come: God's house, formerly typified by Israel, is now manifested as it really is, containing all "sons" whom God leads to glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>). The terms applied by constant usage to the one nation are thus successively enlarged: the "seed of Abraham" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm" title="For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.">Hebrews 2:16</a>), "the people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>), the "house of God" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-21.htm" title="And having an high priest over the house of God;">Hebrews 10:21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">If we hold</span> <span class= "bld">fast</span> <span class= "bld">the confidence.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">If we hold the boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.</span> Faithful to his practical purpose, the writer adds to the words "whose house are we" the indispensable condition. The "house" exists ("are we"), to it belong all who possess the Christian "hope;" but for assured and final appropriation of the promise there must be steadfastness "unto the end." This exhortation differs from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-1.htm" title="Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.">Hebrews 2:1-4</a>, in that it more distinctly implies that those who are addressed have a possession which they may lose. The Christian "hope," that aspect of faith which is turned towards the future, is naturally often in the writer's thoughts. The words associated are very striking: hope gives us boldness (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:">2Corinthians 3:12</a>), and of this hope we make our boast. "Boldness" is spoken of again (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-35.htm" title="Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.">Hebrews 10:35</a>): properly meaning "freedom of speech," it denotes the confident, bold feelings and demeanour which connect themselves with the free utterance of thought.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, the Messenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which we profess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ, the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest. As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls. Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and serious thoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a high opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but a type of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church, his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant; Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and Sovereign Ruler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in the ways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end. Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest more wisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.</body></html>
