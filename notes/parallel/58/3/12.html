Here begins definitely the hortatory application of the warning of the ninety-fifth psalm. Its drift, to the end of the chapter, is: You, being called under the SON to a far higher position than your fathers under Moses were, but the retention of your position being, as theirs was, conditional on your faithfulness, see that you do not forfeit it, as some of you may be in danger of doing. That you may, if you are not careful, is shown by the very warning of the psalm, and by the example of your fathers, referred to in the psalm, <span class="accented">all</span> of whom, though called, failed of attainment through unbelief. It is implied all along that the "today" of the psalm includes the present day of grace, and points to a truer rest than that of Canaan, still offered to the faithful. But the full bringing out of this thought is reserved for the next chapter. On the language of ver. 12 we observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The same form of warning, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, occurs <span class="accented">infra <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12</a>:</span>25, but then, suitably to the context, followed by a subjunctive. Here the future indicative which follows, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, denotes a fact in the future, distinctly apprehended as possible (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>). It had not ensued as yet, nor does the writer anticipate the probability of its being the case with <span class="accented">all</span> his readers; but in the state of feeling with regard to the gospel among the Hebrew Christians which the whole Epistle was intended to counteract, he <span class="accented">sees</span> ground for fearing it in the case of <span class="accented">some.</span> Their present wavering might result in apostasy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is not necessary to analyze the expression," an evil heart of unbelief," so as to settle whether the evil heart is regarded as the result of unbelief, or unbelief of the evil heart; the main point to be observed is that unbelief is connected with moral culpability, as is implied further in ver. 13. The unbelief so condemned in Holy Scripture is not mere intellectual incapacity; it is condemned only so far as man is responsible for it on account of his own willful perversity or carelessness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The outcome of such "<span class="accented">evil</span> heart of unbelief," if allowed to become fixed and permanent, will be apostasy (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>) from "the living God," from him who is Eternal Life and the Source of all life and salvation. The thought of the momentous consequence of the falling away of Christians after light enjoyed is prominent in the Epistle (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc.; Hebrews 10:26, etc.). The expression," the living God," further directs attention to the revelation of God in the Old Testament, in which he is continually so designated, and to the thought that it is the same God who has revealed himself finally in the SON. Addressing Hebrew Christians, the writer may mean to say," In apostatizing from Christ you would be cutting yourselves off from the God of your whole ancestral faith." There <span class="accented">may</span> be an intended allusion, too, to the oath, already referred to, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21, 28</a>, the form of which in the original is," As I live" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 Days of temptation are often days of provocation. But to provoke God, when he is letting us see that we entirely depend and live upon him, is a provocation indeed. The hardening of the heart is the spring of all other sins. The sins of others, especially of our relations, should be warnings to us. All sin, especially sin committed by God's professing, privileged people, not only provokes God, but it grieves him. God is loth to destroy any in, or for their sin; he waits long to be gracious to them. But sin, long persisted in, will make God's wrath discover itself in destroying the impenitent; there is no resting under the wrath of God. Take heed: all who would get safe to heaven must look about them; if once we allow ourselves to distrust God, we may soon desert him. Let those that think they stand, take heed lest they fall. Since to-morrow is not ours, we must make the best improvement of this day. And there are none, even the strongest of the flock, who do not need help of other Christians. Neither are there any so low and despised, but the care of their standing in the faith, and of their safety, belongs to all. Sin has so many ways and colours, that we need more eyes than ours own. Sin appears fair, but is vile; it appears pleasant, but is destructive; it promises much, but performs nothing. The deceitfulness of sin hardens the soul; one sin allowed makes way for another; and every act of sin confirms the habit. Let every one beware of sin.</body></html>
