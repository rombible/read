Two different words in the two verses are rendered "confidence" in the Authorised version. The former, as we have seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>), is "boldness;" the latter (here used) is applied to men who make a firm stand when attacked, who stand firmly under pressure. In the first energy of the new life such firm constancy had been shown by them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32-34</a>); but would it be maintained "unto the end"?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we are become partakers</span> (or, <span class="accented">patterers</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of Christ, if only we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end</span>. This is a repetition in another form of the assertion of our position as Christians, with the appended condition, in ver. 6. It is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means that we partake <span class="accented">of</span> Christ as being in communion with him, or that we are partakers <span class="accented">with</span> him of the glory he has won for us (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). The first is undoubtedly the ordinary sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with a genitive in classical Greek, and generally in the New Testament (cf. e.g. infra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), and is on this ground maintained by Bleek, Alford, and others; but in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, followed by a genitive, is as undoubtedly used for" partner" or "companion;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-63.htm">Psalm 119:63</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which has been already cited (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>), and justifies, as it may prove suggested, the expression in this sense here. Cf. also in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-7.htm">Luke 5:7</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, though without an expressed genitive following, occurs in the sense of "partner." Further, the second sense accords better than the first with the view of our relation to Christ so far set forth in the Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> On the word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (translated "confidence"), see what was said under Hebrews 1:3. All the ancient interpreters understood it here in the same general sense as in the former passage - that of <span class="accented">substance</span> or <span class="accented">subsistence</span>, either as denoting our subsistence as members of Christ, or our faith regarded as the substance of our Christian life, or with other modifications of the general meaning. Modern commentators agree in understanding merely the sense in which the word is found to be commonly used by the Alexandrian writers - that of <span class="accented">confidence</span>, derived from the physical conception of a firm foundation. It thus corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 6. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "The beginning" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) of this confidence refers to the earlier stage of the experiences of the Hebrew Christians, before their faith had shown any signs of wavering. There is no sufficient ground for Ebrard's inference from this expression, that the Epistle was not addressed to the Hebrew Church at large, which was the oldest of all Churches, but to "a circle of catechumens and neophytes." The phrase does not imply that the "beginning" was recent. All it need mean is, "Go on as you began." Further, we find, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, a distinct intimation that the Church addressed is one of old standing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Unto the end "may have an individual reference to the end of life, or (the Church being addressed as a community expecting the second advent) a general one to the close of the period of grace during which "<span class="accented">it</span> is called Today." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-19 The saints' privilege is, they are made partakers of Christ, that is, of the Spirit, the nature, graces, righteousness, and life of Christ; they are interested in all Christ is, in all he has done, or will do. The same spirit with which Christians set out in the ways of God, they should maintain unto the end. Perseverance in faith is the best evidence of the sincerity of our faith. Hearing the word often is a means of salvation, yet, if not hearkened to, it will expose more to the Divine wrath. The happiness of being partakers of Christ and his complete salvation, and the fear of God's wrath and eternal misery, should stir us up to persevere in the life of obedient faith. Let us beware of trusting to outward privileges or professions, and pray to be numbered with the true believers who enter heaven, when all others fail because of unbelief. As our obedience follows according to the power of our faith, so our sins and want of care are according to the prevailing of unbelief in us.</body></html>
