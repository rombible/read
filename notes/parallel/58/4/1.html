It is noteworthy that the writer begins with "Let us," though about to write "lest any of <span class= "ital">you;"</span> he will have gained his object if he brings his readers to share his fear.<p><span class= "bld">Lest, a promise being left us.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">lest haply, a promise being</span> (still) <span class= "ital">left.</span> No word must be inserted here that can diminish the generality of the words; in the sequel the statement will be repeated with all possible clearness. Here it is simply said that such a promise remains unexhausted, waiting for complete fulfilment. No Hebrew Christian would doubt this. As in Hebrews 1, the writer's aim is not to establish a truth absolutely new, but to show that in this and in that Scripture a received truth lies contained. Most of our earlier versions (following Luther and Erasmus) give to this clause a different turn, which cannot be correct: "Lest any of you by forsaking the promise of entering in His rest."<p><span class= "bld">Any of you should seem to come short of it.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">any one of you should be accounted to have come short of it.</span> The difficulty here lies in the words rendered "seem" or "be accounted." It appears impossible that the meaning can be "should <span class= "ital">even</span> seem," or "should think himself," or "should show himself," to have failed. It may be that the writer avoids positive and direct language in speaking of what lies beyond mortal ken, and therefore reverently says "should seem to have come short of it." It is more probable that he is influenced by the figure contained in the next word, the <span class= "ital">falling short of</span> a mark; and is thus led to refer to the judge who witnesses and declares the failure,--"Lest any one . . . be held (or, <span class= "ital">be adjudged</span>) to have come short of" the promise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us fear, therefore, lest, a promise being still left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short</span>. This verse is a renewed warning against remissness, based (as is shown by the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) on the preceding argument, but introducing also, by means of the clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., a new thought, the elucidation of which is the subject of what follows. The new thought is that the true "rest of God," typified only by the rest of Canaan, remains still for the attainment of Christians. That this is the case has not yet been shown; and hence the clause, "a promise being still left." etc., does not point to a conclusion already arrived at, but to what is coming. The new thought is taken up in ver. 2, and what has been thus intimated in ver. 1 is asserted as a conclusion after proof in ver. 9. <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc. A different view of the drift of the warning in this verse, main-rained very decidedly by Ebrard, demands attention. It rests on the interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which is taken to mean "should think that he has come too late," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the promise of the rest, under the idea that its meaning had been exhausted in the rest of Canaan. It may be said in support of this view that such is the most obvious meaning of the phrase; that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament most commonly means "think" or "suppose;" that the primary sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is that of being behindhand, either in place or in time; and that the perfect <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is thus accounted for, whereas, according to the usual interpretation, the whole phrase is unsuitable: why was not <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span> written, if a mere warning against remissness was intended? Further, it may be said that what immediately follows is in favor of this view of the purport of the caution in ver. 1, being an evident carrying out of its idea. Thus the verse is supposed to be not at all a continuation of the previous hortatory section, but rather serving as the thesis of the coming argumentative section, though put in the form of a caution because imperfect appreciation of the view to be now established was at the root of the danger of the Hebrew Christians. Some of them at least did not fully grasp the true character of the gospel as being the fulfill-merit of the old dispensation, the realization of its types and promises. They were inclined to rest in the Law as a revelation to which the gospel was only supplementary, and hence to regard the promised land, the offer of which was before their time, as the only rest intended; and therefore the writer, after adducing the example of the Israelites under Moses as a warning against remissness, prefaces his exposition. of the true rest of God by a warning against misapprehending it. But against this view of the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> there are the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> suggests rather (like <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) a warning against conduct that might lead to forfeiture than a correction of an inadequate conception; and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> connects the warning with what has gone before, in which the view of what the true rest is has not entered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Though <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is most frequently used in the New Testament in its sense of "thinking," "<span class="accented">seeming</span> to one's self," yet it has there, as in Greek generally, the sense also of "appearing," "seeming to others;" and certainly, as far as the word itself is concerned, may have this sense here. <span class="accented">Also</span> the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, though its primary idea (as of <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is that of "coming after," is nevertheless invariably used in the New Testament to express "deficiency," or "falling short" (cf. especially in this Epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>): it is never elsewhere (though capable of the meaning) used to express lateness in time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in the sense of "<span class="accented">seem</span> to have fallen short" (rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>) is capable of being accounted for. One explanation of it, adopted by Alford, is indeed hardly tenable. He accounts for the past tense by supposing reference to the final judgment; taking it to mean, "<span class="accented">lest</span> any one of you should then appear [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> be found] to have fallen short." But the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, however used, refers, not to what is made evident, but to what is thought or seems, refuses to be thus misinterpreted. It is better to take it as a softening expression. We may suppose that the writer (with a delicacy that reminds us of St. Paul) was unwilling to imply his own expectation of any failure; and so he only bids his readers beware of so living as even to present the appearance of it or suggest the thought of it to others. According to this view, the tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is intelligible, the supposed deficiency spoken of being previous to its being perceived or suspected. It is not <span class="accented">necessary</span> to supply an understood genitive, such as "the promise," or "the rest," after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It <span class="accented">may</span> be used (as elsewhere) absolutely, to express deficiency or failure; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the conditions required for attainment. One view of its meaning is that it has reference to the idea of being behindhand in a race: but there is nothing in the context to suggest this figure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is not necessary that ver. 1 should express <span class="accented">only</span> the idea of the following argument; it does sufficiently express it in the clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.; and it is in the style of this Epistle to connect new trains of argument by a continuous chain of thought with what has gone before (cf. the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>. and 3.). Though there is uncertainty as to the sequence of thought in the several clauses of the following argument (vers. 2-11), its general drift is clear. Its leading ideas are these: The invitation to enter God's rest contained in the psalm shows that the rest of Canaan, which, though forfeited under Moses, had long been actually attained under Joshua, was not the final rest intended. What, then, is meant by this remarkable term, "my rest," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God's own rest? Our thoughts go back to the beginning of the Bible, where a rest of God himself is spoken of; where he is said to have rested on the seventh day from all his works. Participation, then, in that heavenly rest - a true sabbath rest with God - is what the term implies. Though this rest began "from the foundation of the world," man's destined share in if, however long delayed, was intimated by the typical history of the Israelites under Moses, and by the warning and renewed invitation of the psalm. This renewed invitation makes it plain that it is still attainable by God's people. It has at last been made attainable by Christ. who, as our great High Priest, has himself entered it, and leads us into it if we are but faithful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 The privileges we have under the gospel, are greater than any had under the law of Moses, though the same gospel for substance was preached under both Testaments. There have been in all ages many unprofitable hearers; and unbelief is at the root of all unfruitfulness under the word. Faith in the hearer is the life of the word. But it is a painful consequence of partial neglect, and of a loose and wavering profession, that they often cause men to seem to come short. Let us then give diligence, that we may have a clear entrance into the kingdom of God. As God finished his work, and then rested from it, so he will cause those who believe, to finish their work, and then to enjoy their rest. It is evident, that there is a more spiritual and excellent sabbath remaining for the people of God, than that of the seventh day, or that into which Joshua led the Jews. This rest is, a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires. The rest, or sabbatism, which is the subject of the apostle's reasoning, and as to which he concludes that it remains to be enjoyed, is undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven. But those who do not believe, shall never enter into this spiritual rest, either of grace here or glory hereafter. God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul; and faith in his promises, through his Son, to be the only way of entering that rest.</body></html>
