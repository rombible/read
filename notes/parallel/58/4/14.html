The passage answers closely in thought to the conclusion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>, and might naturally have followed there; but that, before taking up the subject of Christ's priesthood, the writer had another line of thought to pursue, leading up (as has been explained) to the same conclusion. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> at the beginning of ver. 14 either connects <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> ("let us hold fast") with the <span class="accented">verses</span> immediately preceding in the sense, "The Word of God being so searching and resistless, let us <span class="accented">therefore</span> hold fast," etc., - in which ease the participial clause <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., is a confirmation of this exhortation (so Delitzsch); or is connected logically with the participial clause as a resumption of the whole preceding argument. Certainly the idea of the participial clause is the prominent one in the writer's mind, what follows being an expansion of it. And the position of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> suggests this connection. It is to be observed that, after the manner of the Epistle, this concluding exhortation serves also as a transition to the subject of the following chapters, and anticipates in some degree what is to be set forth, though all the expressions used have some ground in what has gone before. <span class="cmt_word">Having then a great High Priest who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</span> The rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> in the A.V. ("is passed <span class="accented">into</span> the heavens") is evidently wrong. The idea is that Christ has passed <span class="accented">through</span> the intermediate heavens to the immediate presence of God - to the sphere of the eternal <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>. In his use of the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, the writer may have had in his mind the Jewish view of an ascending series of created heavens. Clemens Alexandrinus, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> speaks of seven: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Cf. also "the heaven and the heaven of heavens" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-18.htm">2 Chronicles 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>), and "who hast set thy glory above the heavens" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>), also "the third heaven," into which St. Paul was rapt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). Cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. The conception of the phrase is that, whatever spheres of created heavens intervene between our earth and the eternal uncreated, beyond them to it Christ has gone, - into "heaven itself (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>);" "before the <span class="accented">face</span> of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). From this expression, together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a> (above quoted), is rightly deduced the doctrine of Christ s ubiquity even in his human nature. For, carrying that nature with him and still retaining it, he is spoken of as having passed to the region which admits no idea of limitation, and so as to "fill all things." The obvious bearing of this doctrine on that of the presence in the Eucharist may be noted in passing. (It is to be observed that "the heavens" in the plural is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>) of the seat of the Divine majesty itself to which Christ has gone. It is the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> that determines the meaning here.) The designation, "Jesus the Son of God," draws attention first to the man Jesus who was known by that name in the flesh, and secondly to the "more excellent name," above expatiated on, in virtue of which he "hath passed through the heavens." The conclusion follows that it is the human Jesus, with his humanity, who, being also the Son of God, has so "passed through." There may <span class="accented">possibly</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> some think) be an intention of contrasting him with Joshua (<span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 8), who won the entrance into the typical rest. But it is not necessary to suppose this; vers. 8 and 14 are at too great a distance from each other to suggest a connection of thought between them; and besides <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> occurred similarly at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>, before any mention of Joshua. The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> distinguishes Christ from all other high priests (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The high priest of the Law passed through the veil to the earthly symbol of the eternal glory; the "great High Priest" has passed through the heavens to the eternal glory itself. As to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. on Hebrews 3:1. In consideration of having such a High Priest, who, as is expressed in what follows, can both sympathize and succor, the readers are exhorted to "hold fast," not only their inward faith, but their "confession" of it before men. A besetting danger of the Hebrew Christians was that of shrinking from a full and open confession under the influence of gainsaying or persecution. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Observe the end proposed: rest spiritual and eternal; the rest of grace here, and glory hereafter; in Christ on earth, with Christ in heaven. After due and diligent labour, sweet and satisfying rest shall follow; and labour now, will make that rest more pleasant when it comes. Let us labour, and quicken each other to be diligent in duty. The Holy Scriptures are the word of God. When God sets it home by his Spirit, it convinces powerfully, converts powerfully, and comforts powerfully. It makes a soul that has long been proud, to be humble; and a perverse spirit, to be meek and obedient. Sinful habits, that are become as it were natural to the soul, and rooted deeply in it, are separated and cut off by this sword. It will discover to men their thoughts and purposes, the vileness of many, the bad principles they are moved by, the sinful ends they act to. The word will show the sinner all that is in his heart. Let us hold fast the doctrines of Christian faith in our heads, its enlivening principles in our hearts, the open profession of it in our lips, and be subject to it in our lives. Christ executed one part of his priesthood on earth, in dying for us; the other he executes in heaven, pleading the cause, and presenting the offerings of his people. In the sight of Infinite Wisdom, it was needful that the Saviour of men should be one who has the fellow-feeling which no being but a fellow-creature could possibly have; and therefore it was necessary he should actual experience of all the effects of sin that could be separated from its actual guilt. God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, Ro 8:3; but the more holy and pure he was, the more he must have been unwilling in his nature to sin, and must have had deeper impression of its evil; consequently the more must he be concerned to deliver his people from its guilt and power. We should encourage ourselves by the excellence of our High Priest, to come boldly to the throne of grace. Mercy and grace are the things we want; mercy to pardon all our sins, and grace to purify our souls. Besides our daily dependence upon God for present supplies, there are seasons for which we should provide in our prayers; times of temptation, either by adversity or prosperity, and especially our dying time. We are to come with reverence and godly fear, yet not as if dragged to the seat of justice, but as kindly invited to the mercy-seat, where grace reigns. We have boldness to enter into the holiest only by the blood of Jesus; he is our Advocate, and has purchased all our souls want or can desire.</body></html>
