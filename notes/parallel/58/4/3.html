The former looks back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>, "by faith"<span class= "ital">--"for</span> it is we who believed that enter." . . . The latter looks forward to the remainder of the verse, the purport of which is that the rest exists, and that "entering into the rest" may still be spoken of.<p><span class= "bld">As I have sworn . . .</span>--Rather (as above), <span class= "ital">as I sware in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest, </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-11.htm" title="So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)">Hebrews 3:11</a>.) If in the Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-8.htm" title="Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:">Psalm 95:8</a>) God warns men of a later age not to imitate the guilt of those whom He excluded from His rest, it follows (see below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-10.htm" title="For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.">Hebrews 4:10</a>) that the time for entering into the rest of God was not then past and gone.<p><span class= "bld">Although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span>--And therefore the rest into which God will enter with His redeemed people is not that which succeeded the works of creation. This caution is added because the words used by the Psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-11.htm" title="To whom I swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.">Psalm 95:11</a>) are derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; though the same words are used, yet, we are reminded, the thought is widely different. The next two verses simply expand and support the thought contained in this: "For whereas we read in one Scripture that God 'rested' on the seventh day, another records His sentence on the disobedient people, 'They <span class= "ital">shall not</span> enter into My rest.'"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we do enter into the rest, we who have believed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the historical aorist, pointing to the time when Christians became believers; with a reference also to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in the preceding verse: but the emphasis is on the first word in the sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>: "For we Christian believers <span class="accented">have</span> an entrance into the rest intended") <span class="cmt_word">even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world</span>. This seems to be a concise enunciation of the proof, unfolded in the verses that follow, of the true rest being one into which Christians have still an entrance. The idea is that, though God's own rest had been from the beginning, and man had not yet entered it, yet the possibility of his doing so had not ceased to be intimated: it had continued open potentially to man. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 The privileges we have under the gospel, are greater than any had under the law of Moses, though the same gospel for substance was preached under both Testaments. There have been in all ages many unprofitable hearers; and unbelief is at the root of all unfruitfulness under the word. Faith in the hearer is the life of the word. But it is a painful consequence of partial neglect, and of a loose and wavering profession, that they often cause men to seem to come short. Let us then give diligence, that we may have a clear entrance into the kingdom of God. As God finished his work, and then rested from it, so he will cause those who believe, to finish their work, and then to enjoy their rest. It is evident, that there is a more spiritual and excellent sabbath remaining for the people of God, than that of the seventh day, or that into which Joshua led the Jews. This rest is, a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires. The rest, or sabbatism, which is the subject of the apostle's reasoning, and as to which he concludes that it remains to be enjoyed, is undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven. But those who do not believe, shall never enter into this spiritual rest, either of grace here or glory hereafter. God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul; and faith in his promises, through his Son, to be the only way of entering that rest.</body></html>
