In speaking of "weaknesses" the writer uses a word applicable both to the people and to their Lord, who was "crucified through weakness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.">2Corinthians 13:4</a>). Its meaning must not be limited to the region of pain and bodily suffering: whatever belongs to the necessary limitations of that human nature which He assumed is included. As He learned His obedience from sufferings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>), He gained His knowledge of the help we need in that "Himself took our weaknesses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>), and was Himself tempted in like manner, save that in Him sin had no place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>). These last words supply the limit to the thought of weakness and temptation as applied to our High Priest. Not only was the temptation fruitless in <span class= "ital">leading to</span> sin (this is implied here, but only as a part or a result of another truth), but in the widest sense He could say, "The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in Me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>). "Was tempted in all points in like manner," are words which must not be over-pressed; but the essential principles of temptation may be traced in those with which Jesus was assailed. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-25.htm" title="And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.">John 21:25</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all things tempted like as we are, without sin</span>. The power of sympathy (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) of our great High Priest is not adduced to distinguish him from other high priests, but to express, in this respect, his resemblance to them; community of nature and feeling with those for whom he mediates being essential to the conception of a high priest (see ver. 2). The sequence of thought is, "Let us hold fast our confession, not moved from it by the thought of the superhuman greatness of this High Priest of ours, who hath passed through the heavens; <span class="accented">for</span> he can still sympathize with our infirmities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), having undergone our trials." <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament denotes both bodily infirmity, such as disease (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm">John 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-9.htm">Acts 28:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>), and also the general weakness of human nature as opposed to Divine power, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-5.htm">2 Corinthians 12:5, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>). St. Paul seems to have had regard to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in a comprehensive sense - including chronic malady (his "thorn in the flesh"), liability to calamities, "fear and trembling," temptation to sin - when he spoke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-5.htm">2 Corinthians 12:5, 9</a>) of glorying in his infirmities that the power of Christ might rest upon him. With all human <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, of whatever kind, Christ can sympathize in virtue of his own human experience: "Himself took our infirmities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) and bare our sicknesses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>); "himself <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x391;&#x3c2;</span>, though he now lives <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>). The latter part of the verse corresponds in meaning with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-18.htm">Hebrews 2:18</a>, but with further delineation of the temptation undergone by Christ. The concluding <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (best taken in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, which it immediately follows, rather than with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) is not a categorical assertion of Christ's sinlessness, though it implies it, but an exclusion of the idea of sin from-the likeness spoken cf. His temptation was after the likeness of ours, "apart from sin," or "sin except." For similar expressions, though not with definite reference to temptation, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>. But how is the exception of sin to be understood? Is it that, though, like us, tempted, he, unlike us, resisted temptation? Or is it that his sinless nature was incapable of being even solicited by sin? Now, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means sometimes "to tempt to sin," as Satan or our own lusts tempt us (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>, etc.); and also "to prove.... to try," "to test faithfulness," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>, etc., in which sense, with reference especially to afflictive trials, the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is commonly used (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>). That Christ was not only subjected to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in this latter sense, but was also directly assailed by the tempter to sin (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), appears from the Gospel record. But here comes in a difficulty. There can, we conceive, be no real temptation where there is no liability to the sin suggested by temptation, still less where there is no possibility of sinning. But can we imagine any such liability, or even possibility, in the case of the Divine and Sinless One? If not, wherein did the temptation consist? How could it be at all like ours, or one through his own experience of which he can sympathize with us? It was for maintaining, on the strength of such considerations, the theoretic peccability of Christ, that Irving was expelled as heretical flora the Presbyterian communion. The question has undoubtedly its serious difficulties in common with the whole subjeer of the Divine and human in Christ. The following thoughts may, however, aid solution. That Christ, in his human nature, partook of all the original affections of humanity - hope, fear, desire, joy, grief, indignation, shrinking from suffering, and the like - is apparent, not only from his life, but also from the fact that his assumption of our humanity would have otherwise been incomplete. Such affections are not in themselves sinful; they only are so when, under temptation, any of them become inordinate, and serve as motives to transgression of duty. He, in virtue of his Divine personality, could not through them be seduced into sin; but it does not follow that he could not, in his human nature, feel their power to seduce, or rather the power of the tempter to seduce through them, and thus have personal experience of man's temptation. St. John says of one" born of God" that he "doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he <span class="accented">cannot</span> sin, because he is born of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>). He does not mean that the regenerate Christian is not exposed to and does not feel, the power of temptation; only that, so far forth as he lives in the new life from God, he is proof against it; he gives no internal assent to the seduction of the tempter; and so "that wicked one toucheth him net" (ver. 18). What is thus said of one "born of God" may be said much more, and without any qualification, of the Son of God, without denying that he too experienced the power of temptation, though altogether proof against it. Bengel says, "Quomodo autem, <span class="accented">sine pectate</span> tentatus, compati potest tentatis <span class="accented">cum peceato?</span> In intellectu multo acrius anima salvatoris percepit imagines tentantes quam nos infirmi: in voluntato tam celeriter incursum earum retudit quam ignis aquae guttulam sibi objectam. Expertus est igitur qua virtute sit opus ad tentationes vincendas. Compati potest nam et sine peccato, et tamen vere est tentatus." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Observe the end proposed: rest spiritual and eternal; the rest of grace here, and glory hereafter; in Christ on earth, with Christ in heaven. After due and diligent labour, sweet and satisfying rest shall follow; and labour now, will make that rest more pleasant when it comes. Let us labour, and quicken each other to be diligent in duty. The Holy Scriptures are the word of God. When God sets it home by his Spirit, it convinces powerfully, converts powerfully, and comforts powerfully. It makes a soul that has long been proud, to be humble; and a perverse spirit, to be meek and obedient. Sinful habits, that are become as it were natural to the soul, and rooted deeply in it, are separated and cut off by this sword. It will discover to men their thoughts and purposes, the vileness of many, the bad principles they are moved by, the sinful ends they act to. The word will show the sinner all that is in his heart. Let us hold fast the doctrines of Christian faith in our heads, its enlivening principles in our hearts, the open profession of it in our lips, and be subject to it in our lives. Christ executed one part of his priesthood on earth, in dying for us; the other he executes in heaven, pleading the cause, and presenting the offerings of his people. In the sight of Infinite Wisdom, it was needful that the Saviour of men should be one who has the fellow-feeling which no being but a fellow-creature could possibly have; and therefore it was necessary he should actual experience of all the effects of sin that could be separated from its actual guilt. God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, Ro 8:3; but the more holy and pure he was, the more he must have been unwilling in his nature to sin, and must have had deeper impression of its evil; consequently the more must he be concerned to deliver his people from its guilt and power. We should encourage ourselves by the excellence of our High Priest, to come boldly to the throne of grace. Mercy and grace are the things we want; mercy to pardon all our sins, and grace to purify our souls. Besides our daily dependence upon God for present supplies, there are seasons for which we should provide in our prayers; times of temptation, either by adversity or prosperity, and especially our dying time. We are to come with reverence and godly fear, yet not as if dragged to the seat of justice, but as kindly invited to the mercy-seat, where grace reigns. We have boldness to enter into the holiest only by the blood of Jesus; he is our Advocate, and has purchased all our souls want or can desire.</body></html>
