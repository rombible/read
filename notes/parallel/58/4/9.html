It is tacitly assumed that no subsequent fulfilment has altered the relation of the promise. Few things in the Epistle are more striking than the constant presentation of the thought that Scripture language is <span class= "ital">permanent</span> and at all times <span class= "ital">present.</span> The implied promise, therefore, repeated whenever the "to-day" is heard, must have its fulfilment. The rescued people of Israel did indeed find a rest in Canaan: the true redeemed "people of God" shall rest with God.<p><span class= "bld">A rest.</span>--As the margin points out, the word is suddenly changed. As the rest promised to God's people is a rest with God, it is to them "a sabbath-rest." So one of the treatises of the Mishna speaks of Psalms 92 as a "Psalm for the time to come, for the day which is all Sabbath, the rest belonging to the life eternal."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 The privileges we have under the gospel, are greater than any had under the law of Moses, though the same gospel for substance was preached under both Testaments. There have been in all ages many unprofitable hearers; and unbelief is at the root of all unfruitfulness under the word. Faith in the hearer is the life of the word. But it is a painful consequence of partial neglect, and of a loose and wavering profession, that they often cause men to seem to come short. Let us then give diligence, that we may have a clear entrance into the kingdom of God. As God finished his work, and then rested from it, so he will cause those who believe, to finish their work, and then to enjoy their rest. It is evident, that there is a more spiritual and excellent sabbath remaining for the people of God, than that of the seventh day, or that into which Joshua led the Jews. This rest is, a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires. The rest, or sabbatism, which is the subject of the apostle's reasoning, and as to which he concludes that it remains to be enjoyed, is undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven. But those who do not believe, shall never enter into this spiritual rest, either of grace here or glory hereafter. God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul; and faith in his promises, through his Son, to be the only way of entering that rest.</body></html>
