But in what sense? Does he bring before us again the word of Scripture, or the divine Word Himself? Outside the writings of St. John there is no passage in the New Testament in which the word of God is as clearly invested with personal attributes as here. The word is "quick" (that is, <span class= "ital">living</span>)<span class= "ital">, "</span>powerful" (or, <span class= "ital">active</span>--<span class= "ital">mighty in operation, </span>as most of our versions render the word), "able to discern the thoughts of the heart." Philo, whose writings are pervaded by the doctrine of the divine Word (see the Note appended to St. John's Gospel in Vol. I. of this <span class= "ital">Commentary, </span>p. 553), in certain passages makes use of expressions so remarkably resembling some that are before us in this verse that we cannot suppose the coincidence accidental. Thus, in an allegorical explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-10.htm" title="And he took to him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.">Genesis 15:10</a>, he speaks of the sacred and divine Word as cutting through all things, dividing all perceptible objects, and penetrating even to those called indivisible, separating the different parts of the soul. But though these and the many other resemblances that are adduced may prove the writer's familiarity with the Alexandrian philosophy, they are wholly insufficient to show an adoption of Philo's doctrinal system (if system it could be called) in regard to the divine Word, or to rule the interpretation of the single passage in this Epistle in which an allusion to that system could be traced. Nor is the first-mentioned argument conclusive. There certainly is personification here, and in part the language used would, if it stood alone, even suggest the presence of a divine Person; but it is not easy to believe that in the New Testament the words "sharper than a two-edged sword" would be directly applied to the Son of God. In this Epistle, moreover (and even in this context, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>), reference is repeatedly made to the word of God in revelation, without a trace of any other meaning. The key to the language of this verse, so far as it is exceptional, is found in that characteristic of the Epistle to which reference has been already made--the habitual thought of Scripture as a <span class= "ital">direct</span> divine utterance. The transition from such a conception to those of this verse was very easy; and we need not feel surprise if with expressions which are naturally applied to the utterance are joined others which lead the thought to God as Speaker. It is, therefore, the whole word of God that is brought before us--mainly the word of threatening and judgment, but also (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a> and the last member of this verse) the word of promise.<p><span class= "bld">Piercing even to the dividing asunder . . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow.</span> For the comparison of God's word to a sword see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm" title="And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;">Isaiah 49:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>); comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/18-15.htm" title="Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,">Wisdom Of Solomon 18:15-16</a>, "Thine Almighty word leapt down from heaven out of Thy royal throne . . . and brought Thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword, and standing up filled all things with death." The keen two-edged sword penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit (not soul <span class= "ital">from</span> spirit), with unfailing stroke severing bone from bone and piercing the very marrow. The latter words, by a very natural metaphor, are transferred from the material frame to the soul and spirit.<p><span class= "bld">And is a discerner . . .</span>--Is quick to discern, able to judge, the thoughts (reflections, conceptions, intents) of the heart. Man's word may be lifeless, without power to discriminate, to adapt itself to a changed state or varying circumstances, to enforce itself: the Spirit of God is never absent from His word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Observe the end proposed: rest spiritual and eternal; the rest of grace here, and glory hereafter; in Christ on earth, with Christ in heaven. After due and diligent labour, sweet and satisfying rest shall follow; and labour now, will make that rest more pleasant when it comes. Let us labour, and quicken each other to be diligent in duty. The Holy Scriptures are the word of God. When God sets it home by his Spirit, it convinces powerfully, converts powerfully, and comforts powerfully. It makes a soul that has long been proud, to be humble; and a perverse spirit, to be meek and obedient. Sinful habits, that are become as it were natural to the soul, and rooted deeply in it, are separated and cut off by this sword. It will discover to men their thoughts and purposes, the vileness of many, the bad principles they are moved by, the sinful ends they act to. The word will show the sinner all that is in his heart. Let us hold fast the doctrines of Christian faith in our heads, its enlivening principles in our hearts, the open profession of it in our lips, and be subject to it in our lives. Christ executed one part of his priesthood on earth, in dying for us; the other he executes in heaven, pleading the cause, and presenting the offerings of his people. In the sight of Infinite Wisdom, it was needful that the Saviour of men should be one who has the fellow-feeling which no being but a fellow-creature could possibly have; and therefore it was necessary he should actual experience of all the effects of sin that could be separated from its actual guilt. God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, Ro 8:3; but the more holy and pure he was, the more he must have been unwilling in his nature to sin, and must have had deeper impression of its evil; consequently the more must he be concerned to deliver his people from its guilt and power. We should encourage ourselves by the excellence of our High Priest, to come boldly to the throne of grace. Mercy and grace are the things we want; mercy to pardon all our sins, and grace to purify our souls. Besides our daily dependence upon God for present supplies, there are seasons for which we should provide in our prayers; times of temptation, either by adversity or prosperity, and especially our dying time. We are to come with reverence and godly fear, yet not as if dragged to the seat of justice, but as kindly invited to the mercy-seat, where grace reigns. We have boldness to enter into the holiest only by the blood of Jesus; he is our Advocate, and has purchased all our souls want or can desire.</body></html>
