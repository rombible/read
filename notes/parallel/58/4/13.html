It is usually applied to a wrestler who by dragging back the neck overthrows his adversary: and "prostrate" has been suggested as the meaning here. Another explanation refers the word to the drawing back of a criminal's head, so as to expose his face to public gaze; but, though we read of such a custom in Latin authors, we have no proof that the Greek word was used in this sense. There seems no good reason for supposing any allusion to a sacrificial victim with head thrown back (slain, or ready to be slain).<p><span class= "bld">Unto the eyes of him . . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">unto His eyes: with Whom</span> (or, <span class= "ital">and with Him</span>)<span class= "ital"> we have to do.</span> The last solemn words recall the connection of the whole passage. No thought of unbelief or disobedience escapes His eye: the first beginnings of apostasy are manifest before Him.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14-16</a> are the link connecting all the preceding part of the Epistle with the next great section, . Heb 5:1 to Heb 10:18. Following the example of Luther, Tyndale and Coverdale begin the fifth chapter here; but the connection of the three verses with what precedes is too close to justify this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and laid open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do</span>. The main difficulty in this verse is as to the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "<span class="accented">laid</span> open"). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament or LXX., but is, with its compound <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, not uncommon in Philo and Josephus) has in classical Greek the sense of "seizing by the throat," or "bending back the neck," as in wrestling. And this, with the further idea of "overthrowing" or "laying prostrate," is the prevailing sense in Philo, from whom Wetstein quotes many passages in illustration. Taking, then, with most modern commentators, the sense of bending back the neck as the primary one, we have only to consider what secondary meaning is here to be attached to it. Some take the idea to be that of being thrown on the ground supine, so as to be thoroughly exposed to view. So Bengel: "<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">resupino</span>, Graece et Latine dicitur pro patefacio. Corpora quae prona jacent vix nuda censentur; nam se ipsa tegunt: <span class="accented">resupinata</span>, secundum partes nobilissimas quasque et distinctissimas visui patent." Many (Eisner, Wolf, Baumgarten, Kuinoel, Bretschneider, Block, De Wette, etc., following Perizonius, on AElian, 'Vat. Hist.,' 12:58) see an allusion to the Roman custom of exposing criminals "<span class="accented">reducto</span> capite," "<span class="accented">retortis cervieibus</span>," so that all might see their faces (see Suetonius, <span class="accented">Vitel.,'</span> 17; Pliny, 'Panegyr.,' 34. 3). There is, however, no other known instance of the Greek verb being used with this reference, which there seems to be no necessity for assuming. The idea may be simply the general one thus expressed by Delitzsch, "that whatever shamefaced creature bows its head, and would fain withdraw and cloak itself from the eyes of God, has indeed the throat, as it were, bent back before those eyes, with no possibility of escape, exposed and naked to their view." Many of the ancients (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Ecumenius, Theophylact) saw in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> a reference to the treatment of sacrificial victims, as being smitten on the neck or hung by the neck for the purpose of being flayed from the neck downwards, or cut open thence, so as to expose the entrails to view. But no instance is known of such use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, the idea of which may have been suggested to commentators by the figure of the sword in the verse preceding; which figure, however, there is no reason to suppose continued in ver. 13, the idea of which is simply complete exposure, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>. The ancients take the concluding expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as meaning "<span class="accented">to</span> whom our account must be given," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">to</span> whom we are responsible as our judge" - in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The A.V. seems better to give the general idea of relation by the apt phrase, "<span class="accented">with</span> whom we have to do." Of course, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> here has no reference to the Word of God, the recurrence of the word, in a subordinate sense, being merely accidental. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Observe the end proposed: rest spiritual and eternal; the rest of grace here, and glory hereafter; in Christ on earth, with Christ in heaven. After due and diligent labour, sweet and satisfying rest shall follow; and labour now, will make that rest more pleasant when it comes. Let us labour, and quicken each other to be diligent in duty. The Holy Scriptures are the word of God. When God sets it home by his Spirit, it convinces powerfully, converts powerfully, and comforts powerfully. It makes a soul that has long been proud, to be humble; and a perverse spirit, to be meek and obedient. Sinful habits, that are become as it were natural to the soul, and rooted deeply in it, are separated and cut off by this sword. It will discover to men their thoughts and purposes, the vileness of many, the bad principles they are moved by, the sinful ends they act to. The word will show the sinner all that is in his heart. Let us hold fast the doctrines of Christian faith in our heads, its enlivening principles in our hearts, the open profession of it in our lips, and be subject to it in our lives. Christ executed one part of his priesthood on earth, in dying for us; the other he executes in heaven, pleading the cause, and presenting the offerings of his people. In the sight of Infinite Wisdom, it was needful that the Saviour of men should be one who has the fellow-feeling which no being but a fellow-creature could possibly have; and therefore it was necessary he should actual experience of all the effects of sin that could be separated from its actual guilt. God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, Ro 8:3; but the more holy and pure he was, the more he must have been unwilling in his nature to sin, and must have had deeper impression of its evil; consequently the more must he be concerned to deliver his people from its guilt and power. We should encourage ourselves by the excellence of our High Priest, to come boldly to the throne of grace. Mercy and grace are the things we want; mercy to pardon all our sins, and grace to purify our souls. Besides our daily dependence upon God for present supplies, there are seasons for which we should provide in our prayers; times of temptation, either by adversity or prosperity, and especially our dying time. We are to come with reverence and godly fear, yet not as if dragged to the seat of justice, but as kindly invited to the mercy-seat, where grace reigns. We have boldness to enter into the holiest only by the blood of Jesus; he is our Advocate, and has purchased all our souls want or can desire.</body></html>
