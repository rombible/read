Again striking parallels to the language present themselves in Philo, who speaks of the spirit breathed into man at his creation as an "effulgence of the Blessed and Thrice-blessed Nature"; and in the well-known passage of the Book of Wisdom, "She (Wisdom) is the effulgence of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of His goodness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-26.htm" title="For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.">Wisdom Of Solomon 7:26</a>). In the Old Testament the token of the divine presence is the Shechinah, the "cloud of glory" (called "the glory" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a> in this Epistle); here it is the divine nature itself that is denoted by the "glory." Of the relation between this word and that which follows ("substance") it is difficult to speak, as the conceptions necessarily transcend human language; but we may perhaps say (remembering that all such terms are but figurative) that the latter word is internal and the former external,--the latter the essence in itself, the former its manifestation. Thus the "Son" in His relation to "God" is represented here by light beaming forth from light, and by exact impress--the perfect image produced by stamp or seal. These designations, relating to the essential nature of the Son, have no limitation to time; the participle "being" must be understood (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>) of eternal, continuous existence. The word "person" is an unfortunate mistranslation in this place. Most of the earlier English versions have "substance," <span class= "ital">person</span> being first introduced in the Genevan Testament in deference to Beza.<p><span class= "bld">By the word.</span>--The thought seems suggested by Genesis 1. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm" title="For he spoke, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.">Psalm 33:9</a>); the spoken word was the expression of His power. What is said above of "being" applies to "upholding," except that the latter implies a previous creative act.<p><span class= "bld">When he had by himself purged our sins.</span>--The older MSS. omit "by Himself" and "our," so that the words must be rendered, <span class= "ital">when He had made purification of sins.</span> At first the change may seem a loss; but it is easily seen that the simpler statement is more majestic, and also more suitable in this place; the more complete explanation of the truth belongs to a later stage (Hebrews 9). To "make purification of sins" is an unusual phrase (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-3.htm" title="And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.">Matthew 8:3</a>, "his leprosy was cleansed"), meaning, to make purification by the removal of sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1John 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2Peter 1:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-62.htm" title="And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Mark 14:62</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a>. This figure, which we meet with more than twenty times in the New Testament, is throughout derived from the first words of Psalms 110, which are descriptive of the exaltation of the Messiah. Jehovah's investiture of the Son of Man with unlimited dominion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>) and supreme dignity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>); the Saviour's rest after the accomplishment of His work on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>); His waiting for the complete and final subjection of His enemies, are the ideas signified. On the Psalm see below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, being</span>, etc. The participle <span class="greek">&#x1ff3;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x1fde;&#x28;&#x28;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in ver. 4 - denotes (as does still more forcibly <span class="greek">&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the cognate passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>) what the Son is in himself essentially and independently of his manifestation in time. This transcendent idea is conveyed by two metaphorical expressions, differing in the metaphors used, but concurrent in meaning. <span class="cmt_word">The brightness of his glory</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "glory"), though net in classical Greek carrying with it the idea of light, is used in the LXX. for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, which denotes the splendor surrounding God; manifested on Mount Sinai, in the holy of holies, in the visions of Ezekiel, etc.; and regarded as existing eternally "<span class="accented">above</span> the heavens" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-15.htm">Exodus 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7, 8</a>, etc.). But the full blaze of this glory, accompanying" the face" of God, even Moses was not allowed to see; for no man could see <span class="accented">him</span> and live. Moses was hidden in a cleft of the rock while the God's glory passed by, and saw only its outskirts, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the radiance left behind after it; had passed; hearing meanwhile a proclamation of the moral attributes of Deity, by a perception of which he might best see God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>, etc.). Similarly in the New Testament. There also, as on Sinai, in the tabernacle, and in prophetic vision, the glory of God is occasionally manifested under the form of an unearthly radiance; as in the vision of the shepherds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>), the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28</a>, etc.), the ecstasy of Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>). But in itself, as it surrounds "the face" of God, it is still invisible and unapproachable; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>, "<span class="accented">No</span> man hath seen God at any time;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>, "God is Light;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>, "<span class="accented">Dwelling</span> in the light which no man can approach unto (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), whom no man hath seen nor can see." It denotes really, under the image of eternal, self-existent, unapproachable light, the ineffable Divine perfection, the essence of Deity, which is beyond human ken. "Sempiterna ejus virtus et divinitas" (Bengel). Of this glory the SON is the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> - a word not occurring elsewhere in the New Testament, but used by the Alexandrian writers. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "<span class="accented">to</span> radiate," "to beam forth brightness;" and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, according to the proper meaning of nouns so formed, should mean the brightness beamed forth - this rather than its reflection from another object, as the sun's light is reflected from a cloud. So the noun is used in Wisd. 7:26, as applied to <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is there personified in a manner suggestive of the doctrine of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> And Philo speaks of the breath of life breathed lute man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> ('De Spec. Leg.,' &sect; 11). As, then, the eradiated brightness is to the source of light, so is the SON, in his eternal being, to the Father. It is, so to speak, begotten of the source, and of one substance with it, and yet distinguishable from it; being that through which its glory is made manifest, and through which it enlightens all things. The Person of the Son is thus represented, not as of one apart from God, irradiated by his glory, but as himself the sheen of his glory; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>. The above is the view taken by the Fathers generally, and expressed in the Church's Creed, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And express Image of his substance</span>; not "of his person," as in the A.V. The latter rendering is due to the long-accepted theological use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of <span class="accented">personal subsistence</span>, as applied to each of the Three in One. What the Latins called <span class="accented">persona</span> the Greeks at length agreed to call <span class="accented">hypostasis</span>, while the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">essentia</span>) and the Latin <span class="accented">substantia</span> (though the latter word etymologically corresponds with <span class="accented">hypostasis</span>) were used as equivalents in meaning. But it was long after the apostolic age that this scientific use of the word became fixed. After as well as before the Nicene Council <span class="accented">usia</span> was sometimes used to denote what we mean by <span class="accented">person</span>, and <span class="accented">hypostasis</span> to denote what we mean by the <span class="accented">substance</span> of the Godhead; and hence came misunderstandings during the Arian controversy. Bull ('Def. Fid. Nic.,' 2:9. 11) gives a catena of instances of this uncertain usage. The definite doctrine of the Trinity, though apparent in the New Testament, had not as yet come under discussion at the time of the writing of this Epistle, or been as yet scientifically formulated; and hence we must take the word in its general and original sense, the same as that now attached to its etymological equivalent, <span class="accented">substantia. It</span> means literally, "a standing under," and is used <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in a physical sense, for "foundation," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>, "I sink in deep mire where there is no standing," where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> metaphorically, for "confidence" or "certainty," as below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> metaphysically, for that which underlies the phenomena of things and constitutes their essential being. Of the <span class="accented">substance</span>, understood in the last sense, of God the Son is the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, which word expresses a similar kind of relation to the Divine substance as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> does to the Divine glory. Derived from <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (equivalent to "mark," "grave," or "stamp," with an engraven or imprinted character), its proper meaning is the perceptible image on the material so stamped or engraved, of which it thus becomes the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>. Thus the "image and superscription" on a coin is its <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, manifesting what the coin is. The instance of the tribute money (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-20.htm">Matthew 22:20</a>) at once occurs to us: our Lord pointed to the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> on the coin as manifesting its <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, as being Caesar's money. Thus also the lineaments of a countenance are called its <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, as in Herod., 1:116, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. A passage in Philo is illustrative of the sense intended; and it is to be observed (both with regard to the expression before us and to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) that the Alexandrian theologians are important guides to the interpretation of phrases in this Epistle, their influence on its modes of thought and expression being perceptible. He says ('De Plant. Nee.,' &sect; 5) that Moses called the rational soul the image (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Divine and Invisible, as being <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Here, be it observed, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> is used for the form or lineament of the Divine seal itself, not for the copy stamped on the plastic material. And it is applied, as here, to the "Eternal Word," as being the manifestation of what the unseen Godhead is. Hence it would be wrong to understand the word, as some have done, as denoting the form impressed by one substance on another - as though the impression left on the wax were the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> of the seal. This misconception would mislead (as might also <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, if rendered "reflection") in that it would seem to represent the Son as distinct from God, though stamped with his likeness and irradiated by his glory. Arian views about the SON, or even mere humanitarian views about the Christ, might thus seem countenanced. The two words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, as has been said, express a similar relation to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> respectively, and convey the same general idea of the Son's eternal relation to the Father. But both are, of course, but figures, each necessarily inadequate, of the inscrutable reality. If we may distinguish between them, it may be said that the former especially intimates the view of the operation and energy of the Godhead being through the Son, while the latter more distinctly brings out the idea of the Son being the Manifestation of what the God- head is, and especially of what it is to us. <span class="cmt_word">And upholding all things</span>. We have here still the present participle, denoting the intrinsic operation of him who was revealed as Son. Though the word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of upholding or sustaining creation, does not occur elsewhere in the, New Testament, it can hardly have any other meaning here, considering the context. We find a similar use of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-14.htm">Numbers 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, "<span class="accented">to bear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) all this people alone." And in the later Greek and rabbinical writers parallels are found. Chrysostom interprets <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> as meaning <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, which comes to the same thing as "upholding" or "sustaining." The meaning is that not only were "<span class="accented">the</span> worlds" made through him; in his Divine nature he ever "upholds" the "all things" which were made through him, and of which, as SON, he was appointed "Heir;" el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>, "And in him all things consist." And this upholding operation must not be supposed to have been in abeyance during the period of his humiliation. He was still what he had been eternally, though he had "emptied himself" of the state and prerogatives of Deity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>); el. (though the text is somewhat doubtful) <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>, "The Son of man, which is (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>) in heaven." By the word (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) of his power is an expression elsewhere used of the <span class="accented">voluntas efficax</span> of Deity - the <span class="accented">utterance</span> of Divine power; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, "The worlds were framed by the Word (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) of God." The writer could hardly have used it in this connection, if speaking of a created being. As to the reference of "his" before" power," whether to the subject of the sentence or to God, there is the same ambiguity in the Greek as in the English translation. Even if <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> be intended, and not <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (and the former is most likely, since the pronoun, though it be reflective, is not emphatically so), it may with grammatical propriety refer either, like the previous <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, to God, or to him who thus upholds all things. In either case the general meaning of the clause remains the same. Enough has been said on the whole series of phrases which is thus concluded to show the untenableness of the Socinian interpretation, which would refer them only to Christ in the flesh and to the Christian dispensation. On such interpretation of the first of them Bull remarks, "Interpretatio Socinistarum, Deum nempe dici per Filiam saecula condidisse, quod per ipsum genus humanum reformavit et restauravit, et in novum quemdam statum transtulit, prodigiosum est commentum. Sane juramento aliquis tuto affirmare possit, ex Hebraeis, ad quos scripta fuit ilia epistola, ne unum quidem fuisse, qui scriptoris verba hoc sensu intellexerit, aut vel per somnium cogitaverit, per <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">saeculaa</span>, significarum fuisse tantum genus humanum, nedum ejus pattem illam, cui tunc temporis evangelii lux effulserat" ('Jud. Eccl. Cath.,' 5:8). <span class="cmt_word">When he had made purification of sins</span>. (So, according to the best-supported 'rod now generally accepted text.) The aorist is now resumed, denoting an act in time - the act accomplished by him as incarnate SON, previous to and necessary for his entering on the inheritance appointed to him as such. This act, the grand purpose of the Incarnation, was <span class="accented">atonement.</span> There can be no doubt that the cleansing effected by atonement, and not the mere <span class="accented">moral</span> reformation of believers, is meant here by <span class="accented">purification of sins</span>. The sequel of the Epistle, being, as aforesaid, the full expression of the drift of the exordium, is sufficient proof of this. For in it Christ is exhibited at great length as the true High Priest of humanity, accomplishing truly what the Jewish priesthood signified; and as having "sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the <span class="accented">heavens</span>," in virtue of his accomplished atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>). Nor would the Hebrew readers to whom the Epistle was addressed be likely to understand <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> ("purification") in any other sense than this. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the LXX. equivalent for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, frequent in the Old Testament for ceremonial cleansing, the result of atoning sacrifice; in which sense it is accordingly used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>. of this Epistle. The theory of the Jewish ceremonial law was that the whole congregation, including the priests themselves, were too much polluted by sin to approach the holy God who dwelt between the cherubim. Therefore sacrifices were ordained to make atonement for them. The word for "making atonement for" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, which means properly "to cover;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to cover sin from the sight of God. And the result of such atonement was called "purification," or "cleansing." This appears clearly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where the ceremonies of the great Day of Atonement are detailed. After an account of the various sacrifices of atonement, for the high <span class="accented">priest</span> and his house, for the people, and for the holy place itself polluted by their sins, we read (ver. 19), "And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the altar] with his finger seven times, and <span class="accented">cleanse it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), and hallow it from the <span class="accented">uncleanness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">of</span> the children of Israel." And finally (ver. 30), "For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to <span class="accented">cleanse</span> you (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), that ye may be <span class="accented">clean</span> from all your sins before the Lord." It is to be observed, further, that it is especially the meaning of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement that Christ is spoken of afterwards in the Epistle as having fulfilled. For the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Its meaning in the Epistle may be that Christ, by his death, brought into being and established a permanent purification of sins - "a fountain open for sin and for uncleanness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>) - in his blood, which is regarded as now ever offered at the heavenly mercy-seat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>) and sprinkled on the redeemed below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14, 22</a>). Thus the distinction, observed above, between the atonement (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), of sacrifice and its application for cleansing (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) would be preserved (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sat down</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> entered on his inheritance of all things; not simply in the sense of resuming his pristine glory, but of obtaining the preeminence denoted in prophecy as appointed to the Son, human as well as Divine, and won by obedience and accomplished atonement. And this his supreme exaltation (as will be seen hereafter) carries with it the idea of an exaltation of humanity, of which he was the High Priest and Representative. But be it observed that there is no change in the subject; of the sentence. He who "sat down on high" after making purification is the same with him through whom the worlds were made, and whose eternal Divinity has been expressed by the present participles. This identification supports the orthodox position of there being but one personality in Christ, notwithstanding the two natures, and justifies, against Nestorian-ism, the term <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;</span> applied to the blessed Virgin, with other cognate expressions accepted in orthodox theology, such as, "God suffered," though in his human, not his Divine, nature; "God shed his blood" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">On the right hand of the Majesty on high</span>. The expression is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, afterwards cited in this Epistle, and prominently referred to in like manner by St. Paul. The figure is suggested by the custom of Oriental kings, who placed at the right hand of the throne a son whom they associated with themselves in the prerogatives of royalty. Occurring as it does first in a Messianic psalm, the phrase is never applied to the Son's original relation to the Father "before the ages," but only to his exaltation as the Christ (on which see Bleek). The same idea seems expressed by our Lord's own words, "All authority hath been <span class="accented">given</span> unto me in heaven and in earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). But in the <span class="accented">end</span>, according to St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24, 28</a>), this peculiar "kingship" of the SON will cease, the redemptive purpose being accomplished. It is to be observed that, both here and afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>), a fine periphrasis is used for "right-hand of God;" "the right hand of the Majesty on high" and "the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." This may be regarded, not only as characteristic of the eloquent style of the Epistle, but also as implying an avoidance of too local or physical a view of the session spoken cf. It is apparent elsewhere how the writer sees in the figures used to denote heavenly things only signs, level to our comprehension, of corresponding realities beyond our ken. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 God spake to his ancient people at sundry times, through successive generations, and in divers manners, as he thought proper; sometimes by personal directions, sometimes by dreams, sometimes by visions, sometimes by Divine influences on the minds of the prophets. The gospel revelation is excellent above the former; in that it is a revelation which God has made by his Son. In beholding the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Lord Jesus Christ, we behold the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Father, Joh 14:7; the fulness of the Godhead dwells, not typically, or in a figure, but really, in him. When, on the fall of man, the world was breaking to pieces under the wrath and curse of God, the Son of God, undertaking the work of redemption, sustained it by his almighty power and goodness. From the glory of the person and office of Christ, we proceed to the glory of his grace. The glory of His person and nature, gave to his sufferings such merit as was a full satisfaction to the honour of God, who suffered an infinite injury and affront by the sins of men. We never can be thankful enough that God has in so many ways, and with such increasing clearness, spoken to us fallen sinners concerning salvation. That he should by himself cleanse us from our sins is a wonder of love beyond our utmost powers of admiration, gratitude, and praise.</body></html>
