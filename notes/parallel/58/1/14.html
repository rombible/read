The last word, "salvation," expresses the divine purpose indicated by all the prophecies that have passed under review. The chapter has been occupied with promises of the Christ: the last word brings before us Jesus, the Saviour.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are they not all</span>, etc.? A final expression, adduced in contrast, of the position and office of the angels, as seen above. The A.V. suggests the idea, not conveyed by the Greek, of g<span class="accented">uardian</span> angels. The more correct translation is, <span class="accented">Are they not all ministering</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;</span>) <span class="accented">spirits, for service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">sent forth, on account of those who are to</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">inherit salvation?</span> The allusion is generally to their office of subordinate ministration in furtherance of the Divine purposes of human salvation; the continuance of such office being denoted by the present participle, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-14 Many Jews had a superstitious or idolatrous respect for angels, because they had received the law and other tidings of the Divine will by their ministry. They looked upon them as mediators between God and men, and some went so far as to pay them a kind of religious homage or worship. Thus it was necessary that the apostle should insist, not only on Christ's being the Creator of all things, and therefore of angels themselves, but as being the risen and exalted Messiah in human nature, to whom angels, authorities, and powers are made subject. To prove this, several passages are brought from the Old Testament. On comparing what God there says of the angels, with what he says to Christ, the inferiority of the angels to Christ plainly appears. Here is the office of the angels; they are God's ministers or servants, to do his pleasure. But, how much greater things are said of Christ by the Father! And let us own and honour him as God; for if he had not been God, he had never done the Mediator's work, and had never worn the Mediator's crown. It is declared how Christ was qualified for the office of Mediator, and how he was confirmed in it: he has the name Messiah from his being anointed. Only as Man he has his fellows, and as anointed with the Holy Spirit; but he is above all prophets, priests, and kings, that ever were employed in the service of God on earth. Another passage of Scripture, Ps 102:25-27, is recited, in which the Almighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared, both in creating the world and in changing it. Christ will fold up this world as a garment, not to be abused any longer, not to be used as it has been. As a sovereign, when his garments of state are folded and put away, is a sovereign still, so our Lord, when he has laid aside the earth and heavens like a vesture, shall be still the same. Let us not then set our hearts upon that which is not what we take it to be, and will not be what it now is. Sin has made a great change in the world for the worse, and Christ will make a great change in it for the better. Let the thoughts of this make us watchful, diligent, and desirous of that better world. The Saviour has done much to make all men his friends, yet he has enemies. But they shall be made his footstool, by humble submission, or by utter destruction. Christ shall go on conquering and to conquer. The most exalted angels are but ministering spirits, mere servants of Christ, to execute his commands. The saints, at present, are heirs, not yet come into possession. The angels minister to them in opposing the malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting and keeping their bodies, instructing and comforting their souls, under Christ and the Holy Ghost. Angels shall gather all the saints together at the last day, when all whose hearts and hopes are set upon perishing treasures and fading glories, will be driven from Christ's presence into everlasting misery.</body></html>
