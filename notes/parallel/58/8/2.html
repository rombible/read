It is difficult, however, to decide on the meaning of the words here joined with it--whether they denote holy things or holy place; if the latter, what is the distinction between this holy place and "the true tabernacle"? The ordinary usage of the Epistle would suggest "holy place," and perhaps the occurrence of both expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a> (where there is no doubt as to the translation) is sufficient to remove any hesitation here. The "sanctuary," therefore, will probably be the heavenly counterpart of the Holiest Place; the "true (or, <span class= "ital">real</span>) Tabernacle," the counterpart of the sacred Tent of Moses, containing both the Holy Place and the Holiest of all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2-4</a>). It is not certain that in this place we need go beyond this point, though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a> the more developed thought may require a closer interpretation. The Holy of Holies is the place of God's immediate presence; the Tabernacle, that of God's appointed service. The latter is expressly mentioned here because special reference is to be made to its typical representation upon earth; this is shown by the following words, which point to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.">Exodus 33:7</a>. The word rendered "true" (which occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>) is full of interest, denoting that which is contrasted with everything shadowy or imperfect or merely typical; it is a word especially characteristic of the Gospel of St. John. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A minister of the sanctuary</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">neuter</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>, equivalent to "the holy places;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</span> The <span class="accented">sphere</span> of Christ's priestly ministration (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, being the recognized words in the LXX. and Josephus for denoting sacerdotal functions, - hence <span class="accented">Liturgy</span>) is thus in the first place pointed to as being a heavenly one, symbolized only by the earthly sanctuary. But what is the <span class="accented">true</span> tabernacle, in which Christ ministers? Are we to suppose that an actual prototype of the earthly tabernacle is regarded as existing locally beyond the sky? No; it is only implied that there are, in the suprasensuous sphere, facts and relations which are symbolized and made level to our comprehension by local imagery. Still, there may be conceived as present to the writer's mind an ideal picture of a heavenly temple, such as was seen in vision by prophets, and served to aid their conception of realities beyond their ken. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>, where the thunderstorm is described, the LORD is conceived, in the introductory and concluding verses, as enthroned above it in his heavenly temple, sitting there a King for ever, and worshipped by the "sons of God." Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a> Michaiah sees in vision "the Loud sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him, on his right hand and on his left." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. this throne is seen as the distinct counterpart of the mercy-seat in the earthly temple, with the winged forms above it, and the "house" filled with the smoke of incense, and live coals upon the altar. Ezekiel's still more remarkable visions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1, 10, 11</a>.) are in like manner enlargements of the idea of the Shechinah in the holy of holies (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>:20). Then the visions of St. John in the Revelation have the same basis; there is still seen a glorious counterpart above of the temple below; though now with new accessories, expressive of accomplished redemption. But that St. John's visions are meant only as imagery representing the incomprehensible is evident throughout, and especially from the ideal description of the holy city in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, in which ver. 22 is peculiarly significant: "And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it." In the same way is to be understood the "true tabernacle." If, as we may suppose, the writer had before his mind the prophetic visions of such a heavenly temple, he entertains them only as imaging spiritual facts and relations in the regions of eternity. "Which the Lord pitched," etc., may have reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The substance, or summary, of what had been declared was, that Christians had such a High Priest as they needed. He took upon himself human nature, appeared on earth, and there gave himself as a sacrifice to God for the sins of his people. We must not dare to approach God, or to present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending upon his merits and mediation; for we are accepted only in the Beloved. In all obedience and worship, we should keep close to God's word, which is the only and perfect standard. Christ is the substance and end of the law of righteousness. But the covenant here referred to, was that made with Israel as a nation, securing temporal benefits to them. The promises of all spiritual blessings, and of eternal life, revealed in the gospel, and made sure through Christ, are of infinitely greater value. Let us bless God that we have a High Priest that suits our helpless condition.</body></html>
