On the connection of thought, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a>. "Copy," not in the sense of perfect resemblance, but rather a <span class= "ital">token</span> suggesting and designed to suggest the original. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>, where the same word is used.) "Shadow," as the shadow has no substance or independent existence, but represents only the outline of an object. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>, where "shadow" is contrasted with "the very image"; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm" title=" Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.">Colossians 2:17</a>, where it is opposed to "the body.") We must not confound these words, "token" and "shadow," with "the pattern" mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>, quoted later in this verse. The "heavenly things" are "the sanctuary" and "the tabernacle "of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>, the realities to which the true earthly tabernacle corresponded; their nature can be understood only when Christ has come as High Priest of the good things to come. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>.) That every part of God's earthly house might be a fitting emblem of spiritual truth to be afterwards revealed. Moses was charged in all respects to follow the pattern which had been shown him in the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>). Jewish tradition understood these words to imply the presentation of a heavenly tabernacle to the sight of Moses, as a model to be imitated with exactness; and Stephen's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm" title="Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.">Acts 7:44</a>, "according to the pattern" (the same word is here used) "which he had seen," convey the same meaning. In itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>, when compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-9.htm" title="Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, said the Lord.">Hebrews 8:9</a> in the same chapter, does not necessarily involve a visible representation. But whether we think of a pattern shown in vision, or merely of explicit direction received by Moses, the meaning of "the heavenly things" remains the same. The view here presented of the Jewish tabernacle involves no depreciation, except in comparison with "the good things to come."

The reference here is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; the words which "the LORD spake unto Moses." Rabbinical writers, holding the view of an actual heavenly tabernacle, the prototype of the earthly one, have concluded from the passage in Exodus that Moses had a vision of it, or that a visible representation of it was exhibited to him on the mount. All that is necessarily implied is that he was divinely admonished to make the tabernacle after the fashion conveyed, in whatever way, to his apprehension when on the mount, so that it might be a true representation of some heavenly reality (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The substance, or summary, of what had been declared was, that Christians had such a High Priest as they needed. He took upon himself human nature, appeared on earth, and there gave himself as a sacrifice to God for the sins of his people. We must not dare to approach God, or to present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending upon his merits and mediation; for we are accepted only in the Beloved. In all obedience and worship, we should keep close to God's word, which is the only and perfect standard. Christ is the substance and end of the law of righteousness. But the covenant here referred to, was that made with Israel as a nation, securing temporal benefits to them. The promises of all spiritual blessings, and of eternal life, revealed in the gospel, and made sure through Christ, are of infinitely greater value. Let us bless God that we have a High Priest that suits our helpless condition.</body></html>
