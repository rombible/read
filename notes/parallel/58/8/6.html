The last of these passages is closely akin to this. There we read that by how much the Priest appointed by the divine oath is raised above all other priests, by so much is His covenant better than theirs. Here, that as He is Mediator of a better covenant, in the same proportion does His ministry excel that of priests on earth.<p><span class= "bld">Which was established.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">one that hath been ordained.</span> The verb, properly meaning "to legislate," has already occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>, "the people hath received the Law" (literally, <span class= "ital">hath been legislated for</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Here, then, a word which properly refers to the passing of a law is applied to a covenant. The explanation must be sought in the special nature of the covenants of God with man (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>), which are not compacts between equals, but arrangements offered by the divine goodness, and made dependent upon conditions. Hence such a covenant may be spoken of as ordained, enacted, on the basis of promise. On the promises (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:">Hebrews 8:8-12</a>) which are given by God is based the "covenant" which becomes the law of His kingdom and the declaration of His procedure. The man who accepts the promises by entering into the conditions laid down is dealt with according to this law. Here, Jesus is the "Mediator," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a> (see Note) the "Surety," of the better covenant. The idea is expanded below in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-18</a>. On the tacit comparison with Moses, as mediator of the first covenant, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;</span> in its usual logical, not temporal, sense; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>; also Hebrews 2:8; 9:26; 12:26) <span class="cmt_word">hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the Mediator of a better covenant, which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">quippequae</span>, as usual) <span class="cmt_word">hath been established upon better promises.</span> Here the idea of the new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, introduced first in the way of anticipation at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, is brought to the front, to be carried out in what follows. There the proved superior greatness of the predicted priest was made the measure of the superior excellence of the <span class="accented">covenant</span> of which he has become Surety; here the superior excellence of the new <span class="accented">covenant</span>, which is now to be shown from prophecy, is made /he measure of that of Christ's priestly ministry, which has just been proved to be of necessity in the sphere of heavenly realities of which the Mosaic ritual was but a copy and shadow. The word here used is not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("surety"), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> ("mediator"); on which it is to be observed that the mediator of the old covenant was not Aaron, but Moses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>): it was he that intervened between God and the congregation in the establishment of the covenant; and thus, in this respect also, the priesthood of the new covenant transcends the old one, in that (as was shown also in the earlier part of the Epistle) the type of Moses, as well as of Aaron, is fulfilled in it. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("established" in A.V.; "enacted" in the recent R.V.) expresses the promulgation of a <span class="accented">law - appositely</span> in the first place to the Law of Moses, which constituted the conditions of the old covenant; but also to the description of the new covenant, which follows from Jeremiah, according to which the <span class="accented">law</span> remains, but to be written on the heart. The gospel is elsewhere regarded under the idea of <span class="accented">law</span>, though not a law of bondage, but of liberty - a law, not of the letter, but of the Spirit (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-31.htm">Romans 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>). The "better promises" are such as the passage from Jeremiah, quoted below, notably represents. Other passages might be referred to (such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 37:24, etc.), of similar significance, though not with the same marked mention of a new <span class="accented">covenant</span> to supersede the old one. This memorable passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-35</a>) occurs in a distinct section of Jeremiah's prophecies (30, 31.), delivered after the commencement of the Captivity, and directed to be written in a book. The subject of the whole section is the restoration of Israel, its ultimate Messianic reference being patent to all who acknowledge any such at all in prophecy. In evidence of this there is not only the passage before us, pointing to an entirely new covenant with Israel, and the ideal tone of the whole prophecy, but also, in particular, the view of all the scattered tribes, not Judah only - the whole ideal Israel - being gathered together from all countries to Zion, and of David himself to rule over them as king. The national and local framework, which the picture has in common with other prophetic visions of the coming days, is of course no difficulty to those familiar with the style of the prophetic books. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The substance, or summary, of what had been declared was, that Christians had such a High Priest as they needed. He took upon himself human nature, appeared on earth, and there gave himself as a sacrifice to God for the sins of his people. We must not dare to approach God, or to present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending upon his merits and mediation; for we are accepted only in the Beloved. In all obedience and worship, we should keep close to God's word, which is the only and perfect standard. Christ is the substance and end of the law of righteousness. But the covenant here referred to, was that made with Israel as a nation, securing temporal benefits to them. The promises of all spiritual blessings, and of eternal life, revealed in the gospel, and made sure through Christ, are of infinitely greater value. Let us bless God that we have a High Priest that suits our helpless condition.</body></html>
