The following quotation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:">Hebrews 8:8-12</a>) is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>. It is the crowning point of that collection of prophecies which is brought together in Heb 30-33, descriptive of the hope and salvation of Israel. The characteristics of the prophecy and its significance in this place will be noticed below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-12.htm" title="For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.">Hebrews 8:12</a>). The quotation agrees in the main with the LXX. (and, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-11.htm" title="And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.">Hebrews 8:11</a>. with the text contained in the Alexandrian MS.), and in one clause only fails to represent the meaning of the Hebrew original. The only point requiring notice in this verse is the substitution of "I will accomplish" for "I will make." The new word closely answers to that which was used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>, "ordained." (See the Note.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For finding fault with them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people), <span class="cmt_word">he saith</span> (or, as some take it, <span class="accented">finding fault, he saith to them</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will accomplish upon the house of Israel and the house of Judah a new covenant: not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</span> The passage is quoted from the LXX., with a few verbal differences which do not affect the meaning. In ver. 9 our A.V. renders the original in Jeremiah "<span class="accented">although</span> I was an Husband unto them," instead of "<span class="accented">and</span> I regarded them not (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." The LXX., followed in the text, gives the more probable meaning. On the whole passage be it observed: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> "Behold, the days come," like "in that day," is a usual prophetic phrase for denoting the age of the Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The failure of the old covenant is attributed in the first place to the people's not continuing in it, and then, as a consequence, to the <span class="accented">LORD'S</span> withdrawal of his protection. The evidence of such withdrawal immediately before the prophet's view may be supposed to have been the Babylonian captivity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The distinguishing characteristics of the new covenant are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> God's laws, not imposed as an external code, but put into the mind and written on the heart; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the general knowledge of the Load by small as well as great, without the former need of continual admonition; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as the originating and inspiring cause of all, the forgiveness on the <span class="accented">Loan's</span> part of past sins. It is important to perceive that this last characteristic of the new covenant, though coming last in order, is given as the reason for the other two; for this is a first principle of the gospel. The sense of forgiveness through Christ, of acceptance in the Beloved, is ever set forth as the inspiring principle of the obedience of Christians. "We love him, because he first loved <span class="accented">us."</span> And hence flow the two results denoted in the prophecy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "I will put my laws," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there will ensue, through the inspiring Spirit, from the sense of forgiveness in Christ, a hearty service of love and loyalty; no mere mechanical observance of an external code. Then, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "And they shall not <span class="accented">teach</span>," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who thus, led by the Spirit, give themselves to such hearty service, will acquire, further, an immediate, and as it were instinctive, "knowledge of the Lord," not confined to "the wise" or "<span class="accented">the</span> scribe," but the personal privilege of even the "little ones" of Christ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>, "<span class="accented">It</span> is written in the prophets, And they shall be <span class="accented">all</span> taught of God;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>, "But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>, "But ye have an unction kern the Holy One, and ye know all things"). It is not to be inferred (as has been) from this last result that a distinct order of ministry is no essential constituent of the Christian Church for admonition of others. The fact that such a ministry was constituted from the first in all the Churches, and was in active operation when apostles wrote as above, is in itself sufficient disproof of such a view. All that is implied is that <span class="accented">all</span> faithful believers, small as well as great (using, of course, the means of grace and edification provided for them in the Church), should themselves have inward illumination and personal communion with God. This is indeed a peculiar glory of the Christian religion. The poorest and the simplest believer may have spiritual perceptions and spiritual experience of his own, surpassing those of his appointed guides, and remaining his own though priests and teachers be unfaithful. "I am small and despised" (may the Christian, still more than the ancient psalmist, say), "yet do not I forget thy precepts." "I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation." Observe, lastly, the ideality of the whole view given of the effects of the new covenant. It presents to us the purpose, the potentiality, of the new dispensation, rather than results to be fully realized in this world; though still actually realized so far as the "glorious light of the gospel" illuminates the Church, and is allowed to "shine into" the human heart. This remark applies to all Messianic prophecy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-13 The superior excellence of the priesthood of Christ, above that of Aaron, is shown from that covenant of grace, of which Christ was Mediator. The law not only made all subject to it, liable to be condemned for the guilt of sin, but also was unable to remove that guilt, and clear the conscience from the sense and terror of it. Whereas, by the blood of Christ, a full remission of sins was provided, so that God would remember them no more. God once wrote his laws to his people, now he will write his laws in them; he will give them understanding to know and to believe his laws; he will give them memories to retain them; he will give them hearts to love them, courage to profess them, and power to put them in practice. This is the foundation of the covenant; and when this is laid, duty will be done wisely, sincerely, readily, easily, resolutely, constantly, and with comfort. A plentiful outpouring of the Spirit of God will make the ministration of the gospel so effectual, that there shall be a mighty increase and spreading of Christian knowledge in persons of all sorts. Oh that this promise might be fulfilled in our days, that the hand of God may be with his ministers so that great numbers may believe, and be turned to the Lord! The pardon of sin will always be found to accompany the true knowledge of God. Notice the freeness of this pardon; its fulness; its fixedness. This pardoning mercy is connected with all other spiritual mercies: unpardoned sin hinders mercy, and pulls down judgments; but the pardon of sin prevents judgment, and opens a wide door to all spiritual blessings. Let us search whether we are taught by the Holy Spirit to know Christ, so as uprightly to love, fear, trust, and obey him. All worldly vanities, outward privileges, or mere notions of religion, will soon vanish away, and leave those who trust in them miserable for ever.</body></html>
