The words joined with it, "in the things which we are saying," would lead us to prefer the second rendering; and when the course of the argument is traced we find it difficult to believe that the writer could express a <span class= "ital">summary</span> of his thought in such words as those which follow.<p><span class= "bld">Who is</span> <span class= "bld">set.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">who sat down.</span> Twice before have the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a> been thus referred to Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13</a>), but their full significance in regard to the present subject has yet to be brought out. When in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a> we read, "such an high priest became us," we must look to what precedes for the explanation--"such a one" as has already been portrayed. Here the case is different, and the meaning of "such" is found in the description which the following words contain. The last verse of Hebrews 7 united the two predictions which pointed to Jesus as Priest and King, and the same thought is contained here, expressed in language which at once recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>. A later passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-11.htm" title="And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:">Hebrews 10:11-12</a>) will show that the words "sat down" have yet further significance, involving a contrast to the continued and ever incomplete services of those who "stood before God" in His earthly sanctuary. The next verse must be closely joined with this, for the contrast just spoken of does not imply that He no longer "ministers" on behalf of men (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>); on the contrary, it is as "a minister" of the sanctuary that He sat down on the right hand of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the chief matter in</span> (or, <span class="accented">in regard to</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the things which are being said is</span> (or, <span class="accented">to sum up what we are saying</span>).

He took upon himself human nature, appeared on earth, and there gave himself as a sacrifice to God for the sins of his people. We must not dare to approach God, or to present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending upon his merits and mediation; for we are accepted only in the Beloved. In all obedience and worship, we should keep close to God's word, which is the only and perfect standard. Christ is the substance and end of the law of righteousness. But the covenant here referred to, was that made with Israel as a nation, securing temporal benefits to them. The promises of all spiritual blessings, and of eternal life, revealed in the gospel, and made sure through Christ, are of infinitely greater value. Let us bless God that we have a High Priest that suits our helpless condition.</body></html>
