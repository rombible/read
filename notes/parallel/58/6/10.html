It appears that the Hebrew Christians had formerly (some especial occasion being probably referred to) been active in their charity towards fellow-Christians in distress, and that such charity had not ceased. On this is grounded the persuasion that they will be kept steadfast in the faith. Those who had so shown their faith by their works would surely not be allowed to lose it. The very idea of the Divine justice implies that the use of grace, thus evidenced, will be rewarded by continuance of grace. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perfect it (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) until the day of Jesus Christ; "where also there is reference to deeds of charity, shown in the case of the Philippians by their sympathy with the apostle in his bonds, which charity he prays may "abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all discernment." No difficulty need be felt in this reference to God's justice, as though it involved the doctrine of human merit, <span class="accented">de congruo</span> or <span class="accented">de condigno</span>, claiming reward as of debt. The simple and obvious view, that God, in virtue of his justice, will be most gracious to those who have used his grace, by no means contravenes the doctrine of all grace being the free gift of his bounty (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, etc.). Observe, too, as bearing on the idea of this passage, how the will to <span class="accented">do</span> the will of God is said by our Lord to be followed by knowledge of the <span class="accented">doctrine</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>), and how works of charity are the very tests of the final judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9,10 There are things that are never separated from salvation; things that show the person to be in a state of salvation, and which will end in eternal salvation. And the things that accompany salvation, are better things than ever any dissembler or apostate enjoyed. The works of love, done for the glory of Christ, or done to his saints for Christ's sake, from time to time, as God gives occasion, are evident marks of a man's salvation; and more sure tokens of saving grace given, than the enlightenings and tastings spoken of before. No love is to be reckoned as love, but working love; and no works are right works, which flow not from love to Christ.</body></html>
