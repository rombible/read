The order of the Greek has been thought to require the rendering <span class= "ital">baptisms of doctrine</span> (or, <span class= "ital">teaching</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> and it has been believed that the writer in this manner seeks to characterise Christian baptism as contrasted with the Jewish lustrations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>, "baptising them . . . teaching them," is often quoted in favour of this view. The whole question of baptism amongst the Jews of the Apostolic age is full of difficulty, since the first references to the rite in connection with proselytes belong to a much later date. But, waiving this, we must surely regard it as most unlikely that the baptism specifically Christian would be marked as "baptism <span class= "ital">of teaching."</span> Teaching would rather be the point of resemblance than the point of contrast between the Jewish and the Christian rite. We must, therefore, adhere to the ordinary view. The word <span class= "ital">doctrine, </span>or <span class= "ital">teaching, </span>seems to be introduced in order to avoid the ambiguity which would lie in the words, "a foundation of repentance, faith, baptism," &c.; not a doctrine, but the repetition of a rite might seem to be intended. But what are we to understand by teaching regarding <span class= "ital">baptisms?</span> Both the word itself and the use of the plural are remarkable. The word (which is not the ordinary term <span class= "ital">baptisma, </span>but <span class= "ital">baptismus</span>) occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-4.htm" title="And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables.">Mark 7:4</a>, in the plural, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a> in the singular; in the last of these passages it denotes Christian baptism, but in the others the ceremonial <span class= "ital">washings</span> of the Jews. We must not forget the importance which of right belonged to these washings in the Levitical law, as one of the appointed modes of removing that uncleanness which excluded from every sacred place. The baptism of John attached itself to passages in the Scriptures in which this symbol was taken up by the prophets with profound spiritual application (Ezekiel 36, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Both John's baptism and that of Christ, therefore, would, from the Hebrew point of view, be "washings"; and the teaching which every new convert must receive would include instruction on the symbolical purifications of the Old Covenant and the New. (See the very interesting Notes in Vol. II. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-24.htm" title="And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.">Acts 18:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-4.htm" title="Then said Paul, John truly baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.">Acts 19:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And of laying on of hands.</span>--This ceremony is repeatedly mentioned in the Old Testament, and also in the New. Besides the sacrificial use of the symbol, we find imposition of hands connected with blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-14.htm" title="And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.">Genesis 48:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm" title="Then were there brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.">Matthew 19:13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> with works of healing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-11.htm" title="But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.">2Kings 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-23.htm" title="And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands on him, he asked him if he saw ought.">Mark 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm" title="They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.">Mark 16:18</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> with ordination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;">Numbers 27:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-9.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.">1Timothy 4:14</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> and with the gift of the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm" title="Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.">Acts 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>). In every case the figure denotes either a transfer, or the communication of a gift from (or, through the medium of) the person who lays his hands upon another. Neither transfer of guilt, nor blessing, nor miracle can be in point here; nor is it conceivable that ordination could be referred to in such a context. As the passages quoted from the Acts of the Apostles agree with this in closely connecting the rite with baptism, we can have little doubt that the meaning in all is substantially the same. The believers in Samaria had been baptised by Philip; when Peter and John came, they "prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost; then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost." In the second case, which in other respects is similar (whether Paul himself baptised, or not, we are not informed), there is reference to the special gifts of the Holy Ghost which were bestowed: "they spake with tongues and prophesied." There seems no reason for believing that there was a designed connection between the imposition of hands and the bestowal of <span class= "ital">miraculous</span> powers; such imposition was rather the recognised symbol of the gift of the Holy Spirit to those who were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus, in whatever manner the Spirit might be pleased to work in those who received His influence. The early Church naturally retained the rite, making it the complement or adjunct of baptism; whilst the one symbolised the putting away of sin, the other was the emblem of the reception of new spiritual life. Historical testimonies extend as far back as Tertullian (A.D. 200): "Then the hand is laid on, calling for and inviting the Holy Spirit." To trace the relation between this imposition of hands and the later practice of confirmation would lead us beyond our limits.<p>The two points which remain do not require an extended notice. We know (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-8.htm" title="For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.">Acts 23:8</a>) that, though the Sadducees denied that there was any resurrection of the dead (and the Alexandrian philosophy seems to have held only the immortality of the soul), yet by the most influential amongst Jewish teachers this doctrine was held and enforced, as indeed it was plainly taught in their Scriptures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a>). On the nature and extent of the resurrection--whether it would be universal, and whether it would precede or follow the Messianic age--varying opinions prevailed. Nor were the Pharisees less clear in their teaching of a future "judgment," the reward of which should be "eternal" bliss for the godly, punishment for the sinners in Israel and for Israel's enemies. These doctrines, then, would place no obstacles in the way of a convert to the Christian faith. Instead of vagueness and discordant opinion he now received a clear statement of truth: the Messiah, Jesus, in whom he has placed his trust, will judge the world; and of this God has given a pledge "in that He hath raised Him from the dead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>). It is noteworthy that, of the four particulars which are mentioned after repentance and faith, two relate to the commencement and two to "the last things" of the Christian life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Every part of the truth and will of God should be set before all who profess the gospel, and be urged on their hearts and consciences. We should not be always speaking about outward things; these have their places and use, but often take up too much attention and time, which might be better employed. The humbled sinner who pleads guilty, and cries for mercy, can have no ground from this passage to be discouraged, whatever his conscience may accuse him of. Nor does it prove that any one who is made a new creature in Christ, ever becomes a final apostate from him. The apostle is not speaking of the falling away of mere professors, never convinced or influenced by the gospel. Such have nothing to fall away from, but an empty name, or hypocritical profession. Neither is he speaking of partial declinings or backslidings. Nor are such sins meant, as Christians fall into through the strength of temptations, or the power of some worldly or fleshly lust. But the falling away here mentioned, is an open and avowed renouncing of Christ, from enmity of heart against him, his cause, and people, by men approving in their minds the deeds of his murderers, and all this after they have received the knowledge of the truth, and tasted some of its comforts. Of these it is said, that it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance. Not because the blood of Christ is not sufficient to obtain pardon for this sin; but this sin, in its very nature, is opposite to repentance and every thing that leads to it. If those who through mistaken views of this passage, as well as of their own case, fear that there is no mercy for them, would attend to the account given of the nature of this sin, that it is a total and a willing renouncing of Christ, and his cause, and joining with his enemies, it would relieve them from wrong fears. We should ourselves beware, and caution others, of every approach near to a gulf so awful as apostacy; yet in doing this we should keep close to the word of God, and be careful not to wound and terrify the weak, or discourage the fallen and penitent. Believers not only taste of the word of God, but they drink it in. And this fruitful field or garden receives the blessing. But the merely nominal Christian, continuing unfruitful under the means of grace, or producing nothing but deceit and selfishness, was near the awful state above described; and everlasting misery was the end reserved for him. Let us watch with humble caution and prayer as to ourselves.</body></html>
