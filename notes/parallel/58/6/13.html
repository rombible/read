The promises made to Abraham were essentially one, with various parts progressively fulfilled. It seems likely that, though the next verse is quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>, the writer also has in mind ("<span class= "ital">had</span> promised") <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>, and especially Genesis 15.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. And so</span>, <span class="accented">having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</span> Abraham - the ancestor of the Hebrews, the first recipient of the promises, the father of the faithful - is now appropriately adduced as an example. He (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>), as is the case with you (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.), was assured of his inheritance by the Divine oath; and so he obtained it, but only through "faith and patience." You have the like assurance, but attended with the like conditions. And then this Divine oath, the significance of which is set forth in vers. 16-18, is made a link of connection between the hortatory section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:20</a>) and the coming argument about Melchizedek. This is one instance of the artistic way in which, throughout the Epistle, the interposed hortatory passages are so turned as to connect the divided sections of the argument. But what is said about Abraham (vers. 13, 14, 15) has been variously understood. It is connected with ver. 12 thus: "<span class="accented">Be</span> ye followers of them who inherit the promises through faith and patience: <span class="accented">for</span> God, in his promise to Abraham, swore by himself in confirmation of it; <span class="accented">and so</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>) through patience he obtained the promise. Be it here observed that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 15 ("having patiently endured," A.V.) corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 12, and expresses essentially the same idea. The aorist participle <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> does not in itself imply that the patience was previous to the obtaining; it expresses only that by patiently enduring he obtained. Observe also that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-44.htm">Acts 27:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-14.htm">Acts 28:14</a>) denotes the <span class="accented">consequence</span> from what has been previously stated; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> followed from the Divine oath ensuring the fulfillment of the promise. Both his eventually obtaining and his patience in awaiting fulfillment were in consequence of the assuring oath. But then how and when did Abraham himself obtain the promise? Not even the temporal fulfillment in the multiplication of his seed and the inheritance of the Promised Land, much less the spiritual fulfillment in Christ, was during his own life. Both he could but see "afar <span class="accented">off."</span> In respect to the latter it is expressly said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13, 39</a>) that the patriarchs did <span class="accented">not</span> receive the promises - <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. What, then, is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>? Bleek understands the time of the oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>.), when the promise was irrevocably assured, to have been the time of obtaining. But more than this is suggested by the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <span class="accented">Hebrews</span> 11:33), as well as by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, viz. the actual attainment of the blessing assured to him by oath. There are two other ways of explaining: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to identify Abraham with his seed, in whom, though not in his own person, he may be conceived to have obtained, - of which view it may be significant that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> of the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) is changed in the Epistle to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to regard Abraham, still alive in the unseen world, as himself enjoying the fulfillment of the ancient promise. So Delitzsch, who, dwelling on the thought that nothing less than the blessing of Abraham extended to the whole world (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a>) can be regarded as complete fulfill-merit, says, "God's oath-sealed word of promise is now fulfilled in Christ, and Abraham, while living on in the unseen world, is conscious of and enjoys that fulfillment, and so may be said to have "obtained the promise." This view derives some support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>, where the longings of the pilgrim patriarchs is so beautifully represented as reaching to a heavenly fulfillment. On the other hand, the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> is against it, and hence view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> may be accepted as a sufficient explanation of the expression (see below, or <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>). With regard to the general drift, it is obvious how <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in respect to the promise first made to him "in Charran," is strikingly displayed in Abraham's recorded life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-20 The hope here meant, is a sure looking for good things promised, through those promises, with love, desire, and valuing of them. Hope has its degrees, as faith also. The promise of blessedness God has made to believers, is from God's eternal purpose, settled between the eternal Father, Son, and Spirit. These promises of God may safely be depended upon; for here we have two things which cannot change, the counsel and the oath of God, in which it is not possible for God to lie; it would be contrary to his nature as well as to his will. And as He cannot lie; the destruction of the unbeliever, and the salvation of the believer, are alike certain. Here observe, those to whom God has given full security of happiness, have a title to the promises by inheritance. The consolations of God are strong enough to support his people under their heaviest trials. Here is a refuge for all sinners who flee to the mercy of God, through the redemption of Christ, according to the covenant of grace, laying aside all other confidences. We are in this world as a ship at sea, tossed up and down, and in danger of being cast away. We need an anchor to keep us sure and steady. Gospel hope is our anchor in the storms of this world. It is sure and stedfast, or it could not keep us so. The free grace of God, the merits and mediation of Christ, and the powerful influences of his Spirit, are the grounds of this hope, and so it is a stedfast hope. Christ is the object and ground of the believer's hope. Let us therefore set our affections on things above, and wait patiently for his appearance, when we shall certainly appear with him in glory.</body></html>
