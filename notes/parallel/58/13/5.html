"Impurity and covetousness may be said to divide between them nearly the whole domain of human selfishness and vice" (Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Conversation.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">way</span> of thought and life, character, disposition.<p><span class= "bld">For he.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">for He Himself hath said.</span> As in many other places in this Epistle, the word of Scripture is regarded as directly spoken by God; but there is an emphasis here ("He Himself") which well suits the remarkable impressiveness of the words quoted, "I will in no wise let thee go; no, nor will I forsake thee." This promise of divine support and protection does not occur exactly in the same form in the Old Testament, but is clearly taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-6.htm" title="Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD your God, he it is that does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, "He will not fail thee nor forsake thee." (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-15.htm" title="And, behold, I am with you, and will keep you in all places where you go, and will bring you again into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken to you of.">Genesis 28:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-5.htm" title="There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail you, nor forsake you.">Joshua 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-20.htm" title="And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.">1Chronicles 28:20</a>.) The appositeness of these words and those which follow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-6.htm" title="So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.">Hebrews 13:6</a>) will be seen if we remember the trials which the Hebrew Christians had already endured (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32-34</a>). It is very probable that this thought supplies the link of connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/13-5.htm" title="Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have: for he has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you.">Hebrews 13:5-6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm" title="Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.">Hebrews 13:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let your conversation</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. manner of life</span>, or <span class="accented">disposition</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>be without covetousness; be content with such things as ye have: for he</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">hath said, I will never</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in no wise) <span class="cmt_word">leave thee, neither will I ever forsake thee.</span> The reference seems to be to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span>, the same assurance being repeated in ver. 8. But similar promises occur elsewhere in the Old Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-20.htm">1 Chronicles 28:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>; "<span class="accented">Est</span> igitur instar adagii <span class="accented">divini</span>," Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 The design of Christ in giving himself for us, is, that he may purchase to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works; and true religion is the strongest bond of friendship. Here are earnest exhortations to several Christian duties, especially contentment. The sin opposed to this grace and duty is covetousness, an over-eager desire for the wealth of this world, with envy of those who have more than ourselves. Having treasures in heaven, we may be content with mean things here. Those who cannot be so, would not be content though God raised their condition. Adam was in paradise, yet not contented; some angels in heaven were not contented; but the apostle Paul, though abased and empty, had learned in every state, in any state, to be content. Christians have reason to be contented with their present lot. This promise contains the sum and substance of all the promises; I will never, no, never leave thee, no, never forsake thee. In the original there are no less than five negatives put together, to confirm the promise: the true believer shall have the gracious presence of God with him, in life, at death, and for ever. Men can do nothing against God, and God can make all that men do against his people, to turn to their good.</body></html>
