(See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Salute all them that have the rule over you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, as before), <span class="cmt_word">and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</span> The fact that no names are here mentioned, as is usual with St. Paul in sending salutations to Churches he was personally well acquainted with, leads us to infer that there had been no such close association, at any rate recently, between the writer and the readers in this case; or else that a circle of Churches in some locality is addressed. Nothing certain can be concluded as to the writer's whereabouts at the time of writing from the expression, "they of Italy (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)," though it seems to favor the idea, rather than otherwise, that he was in Italy at the time, possibly at Rome. For the phrase means simply "natives of Italy" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-13.htm">Acts 18:13</a>; all these being, we observe, expressions of St. Luke's); it by no means implies that they had left Italy. In fact, as Delitzsch observes, "if the author was then in Italy, and at the same time was not a native of Italy, he could not have selected a more appropriate designation for the Italian Christians." The Epistle is concluded by St. Paul's accustomed words, which, with some variations, seem to have been appended to all his letters as his authenticating autograph (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3</a>, etc.) - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:22-25 So bad are men, and even believers, through the remainders of their corruption, that when the most important, comfortable doctrine is delivered to them for their own good, and that with the most convincing evidence, there is need of earnest entreaty and exhortation that they would bear it, and not fall out with it, neglect it, or reject it. It is good to have the law of holy love and kindness written in the hearts of Christians, one towards another. Religion teaches men true civility and good breeding. It is not ill-tempered or uncourteous. Let the favour of God be toward you, and his grace continually working in you, and with you, bringing forth the fruits of holiness, as the first-fruits of glory.</body></html>
