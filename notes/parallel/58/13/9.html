The "teachings" by which they were in danger of being led astray were various, and were all foreign to the one true word. The contrasts expressed in the second part of this verse and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10-11</a>, throw light on the nature and source of the erroneous doctrine. Its subject was not "grace," but "meats;" its promoters were connected with those who serve the Tabernacle. Hence the writer is probably speaking of doctrines and practices similar to those censured by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16-23</a>. (See the introductory Note on Romans 14; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1Timothy 4:3</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a> we read of "meats and drinks" in connection with the Law of Moses; here the divers and strange teachings" must include human additions to that Law and perversions of its spirit.<p><span class= "bld">With grace; not with meats.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">by grace, not by meats.</span> Instead of being "carried away by strange teachings," let your hearts be made firm and sure by grace. As the whole system of ceremonial observance is alluded to under the one term "meats," so the blessings of the Christian faith are comprised under "grace," a word used throughout this Epistle with peculiar significance. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>.) One human system of teaching will but lead on to another; grace will keep the heart firm in its loyal love to Jesus Christ, who is ever "the same" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm" title="Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which have not profited.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in which they that walked were not 'profited.</span> To the English reader the mode of expression must appear peculiar; in the Greek, however, there is little or no incongruity, for the word which we render "walk" is used most freely to denote a course or manner of life. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them." Here the meaning is, that those who have made these external observances the rule of their life have failed of the profit which they sought. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.">Hebrews 7:18-19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not carried away</span> (so, according to the best authorities, rather than <span class="accented">carried about</span>) b<span class="cmt_word">y divers and strange doctrines.

The faith, which was their faith, remains unchanged, as Jesus Christ remains unchanged; why, then, these doctrines, new and strange (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-10</a>)? What these doctrines were is not shown, except so far as is intimated by the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("meats"), which reminds us at once of similar warnings in St. Paul's Epistles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-2.htm">Romans 14:2, 14, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 16</a>-723; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>). These passages seem to refer in the first place to purely Jewish distinctions, still held to by Jewish Christians, between dean and unclean or polluted meats; and further to a new kind of asceticism, not found in the Old Testament, but based probably on notions of the impurity of matter, which led to entire abstention from flesh or wine, and also in some (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>) from marriage; also, as appears from the passage in Colossians, a false philosophy about angels and the spiritual world. We may perceive in these allusions the germs at least of later Gnostic heresies, such as found (as that of the Ebionites) their first congenial soil in Jewish circles; Oriental theosophy, or neo-Platonic philosophy, being supposed to have been engrafted on Jewish modes of thought. Some, misled by what is said in ver. 10, see in the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> an allusion to those sacrifices of the Law which were eaten by the worshippers, against any fancied obligation to partake in which the readers are supposed to be warned. But the word is never so applied in the Old Testament or the New (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-34.htm">Leviticus 11:34</a>; 1 Macc. 1:16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15, 20</a>, 31; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8, 13</a>); nor would such error be likely to be classed among "strange doctrines." The drift of the warning is that the religion of the gospel does not consist in any of these notions or observances, the supposed importance of meats being specially noted, and that to make them its essence is a misconception of its whole meaning, and a departure from the faith: "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:7-15 The instructions and examples of ministers, who honourably and comfortably closed their testimony, should be particularly remembered by survivors. And though their ministers were some dead, others dying, yet the great Head and High Priest of the church, the Bishop of their souls, ever lives, and is ever the same. Christ is the same in the Old Testament day. as in the gospel day, and will be so to his people for ever, equally merciful, powerful, and all-sufficient. Still he fills the hungry, encourages the trembling, and welcomes repenting sinners: still he rejects the proud and self-righteous, abhors mere profession, and teaches all whom he saves, to love righteousness, and to hate iniquity. Believers should seek to have their hearts established in simple dependence on free grace, by the Holy Spirit, which would comfort their hearts, and render them proof against delusion. Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice; he sanctifies the gift. The Lord's supper is the feast of the gospel passover. Having showed that keeping to the Levitical law would, according to its own rules, keep men from the Christian altar, the apostle adds, Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp; go forth from the ceremonial law, from sin, from the world, and from ourselves. Living by faith in Christ, set apart to God through his blood, let us willingly separate from this evil world. Sin, sinners, nor death, will not suffer us to continue long here; therefore let us go forth now by faith and seek in Christ the rest and peace which this world cannot afford us. Let us bring our sacrifices to this altar, and to this our High Priest, and offer them up by him. The sacrifice of praise to God, we should offer always. In this are worship and prayer, as well as thanksgiving.</body></html>
