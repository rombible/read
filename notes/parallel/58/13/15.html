In the psalms it is used to express generally praise and thanksgiving (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>:14, 23; 116:17. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, etc.). In virtue of their participation in the true and complete Sin Offering, Christians may fulfill this part of the ancient symbolism, not occasionally, but "continually;" bringing to God, not fruits of the earth, but the "fruit of the lips" (an expression found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>, where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> continual praise, springing from thankful hearts. In the Eucharist especially (hence so called) such sacrifice is continually offered, over the one atoning Sacrifice which is pleaded and partaken cf. But not in communions only, but ever in their daily lives, such "sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving" is due. But, as the next verse reminds the readers, the "<span class="accented">knit</span> of the lips" is not enough; there is a further sacrifice of our own, whereby we must show that we are true partakers of Christ, and truly thankful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:7-15 The instructions and examples of ministers, who honourably and comfortably closed their testimony, should be particularly remembered by survivors. And though their ministers were some dead, others dying, yet the great Head and High Priest of the church, the Bishop of their souls, ever lives, and is ever the same. Christ is the same in the Old Testament day. as in the gospel day, and will be so to his people for ever, equally merciful, powerful, and all-sufficient. Still he fills the hungry, encourages the trembling, and welcomes repenting sinners: still he rejects the proud and self-righteous, abhors mere profession, and teaches all whom he saves, to love righteousness, and to hate iniquity. Believers should seek to have their hearts established in simple dependence on free grace, by the Holy Spirit, which would comfort their hearts, and render them proof against delusion. Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice; he sanctifies the gift. The Lord's supper is the feast of the gospel passover. Having showed that keeping to the Levitical law would, according to its own rules, keep men from the Christian altar, the apostle adds, Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp; go forth from the ceremonial law, from sin, from the world, and from ourselves. Living by faith in Christ, set apart to God through his blood, let us willingly separate from this evil world. Sin, sinners, nor death, will not suffer us to continue long here; therefore let us go forth now by faith and seek in Christ the rest and peace which this world cannot afford us. Let us bring our sacrifices to this altar, and to this our High Priest, and offer them up by him. The sacrifice of praise to God, we should offer always. In this are worship and prayer, as well as thanksgiving.</body></html>
