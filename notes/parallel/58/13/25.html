No ancient MS. contains more than the simple notice, "To the Hebrews," except the Alexandrian, which adds "written from Rome."

It is good to have the law of holy love and kindness written in the hearts of Christians, one towards another. Religion teaches men true civility and good breeding. It is not ill-tempered or uncourteous. Let the favour of God be toward you, and his grace continually working in you, and with you, bringing forth the fruits of holiness, as the first-fruits of glory.</body></html>
