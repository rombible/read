The Lord be with you all.">2Thessalonians 3:16</a>. In almost all these places there is something in the context suggestive of strife or turmoil to be brought to rest by "the God of peace." Hence we may well believe that the writer here has in thought those divisions of thought and feeling which have been hinted at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/13-17.htm" title="Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.">Hebrews 13:17-19</a>, and which in truth were the expression of the deep-seated mental unrest which it is the object of the Epistle to remove.<p><span class= "bld">Our Lord Jesus.</span>--As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>, the name is introduced after the description, according to the order of the Greek: "Now the God of peace that brought up from the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)">Romans 10:7</a>) the great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus . . ." Two passages of the prophets have contributed to the language of this remarkable verse: (1) <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm" title="Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?">Isaiah 63:11</a>, ""Where is He that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock?" Here the shepherds are no doubt Moses and Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm" title="You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.">Psalm 77:20</a>); the Greek translation, however, has, "Where is he that raised up out of the sea the shepherd of the sheep?" Moses, who led Israel through the sea, was brought up therefrom in safety to be the "shepherd" of his people Israel; by the same Almighty hand the great Shepherd of the sheep has been brought up from among the dead. (2) <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-11.htm" title="As for you also, by the blood of your covenant I have sent forth your prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.">Zechariah 9:11</a>, "As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water." In other words, "because of the blood which ratified thy covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm" title="And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.">Exodus 24:8</a>) I have released thy prisoners." As in the former case, the resemblance between the words in the LXX. and those here used is sufficient to convince us that the passage was in the writer's thought. In (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in virtue of) the blood of an eternal covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-18</a>) God has raised up the Lord Jesus. The covenant was ratified by His blood; the first of the blessings of the covenant, and that in which all blessing lay included, was this, that God raised Him up from the dead to be "the great Shepherd of the sheep." If these prophetic words respecting Him who brings peace to the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm" title="And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace to the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.">Zechariah 9:10</a>, <span class= "ital">et al</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>were in the writer's mind, how natural is his appeal to the God of <span class= "ital">peace.</span> It has been often observed that this is the only passage in the Epistle in which we read of the resurrection of our Lord apart from His ascension; elsewhere His exaltation is contemplated as one act (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It is not certain that we have an exception even here, for though the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)">Romans 10:7</a> is beyond doubt, the words may in this place be used with a wider meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through</span> (literally, in) <span class="cmt_word">the blood of the eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to God, the subject of the sentence) <span class="cmt_word">be glory forever and ever.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Amen</span>. It is St. Paul's way also to introduce, in the end of his Epistles, a solemn prayer or benediction, couched in terms suitable to the subjects that have been dwelt on (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>, etc.). The term, "God of peace," is also usual with him; and it is appropriate here after so many warnings against disturbing the Church's peace; as is, with reference also to what has gone before, "make you perfect" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and what follows. On "the great Shepherd," etc., Bengel says, "Habemus, inquit, antistites multos, ver. 17, sed hic omniam est Antistes. Ego sum absens, ver. 19, sed DEUS non abest, neque deerit." The expression is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>, "Where is he that brought them out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; LXX.)." The reference in Isaiah is to Moses and the Red Sea, the well-known types of Christ and his resurrection, and of ours to a new life, leading to eternal life, through him. He is called "the <span class="accented">great</span> Shepherd," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a> the "great High Priest," as being the true fulfillment of the ancient types. "In [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'in virtue of'] the blood of the covenant" seems to be suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> being added (as <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> before) to distinguish the new covenant from the old. The suitableness of the words to the contents of the Epistle is obvious. It is observed that the above is the only distinct allusion in the Epistle to Christ's resurrection, the writer's treatment of his subject having led him to pass at once from the sacrifice to the heavenly intercession. But "non concludit apostolus, autequam menti-onem fecerit <span class="accented">resurrectionis</span> Christi" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:16-21 We must, according to our power, give to the necessities of the souls and bodies of men: God will accept these offerings with pleasure, and will accept and bless the offerers through Christ. The apostle then states what is their duty to living ministers; to obey and submit to them, so far as is agreeable to the mind and will of God, made known in his word. Christians must not think themselves too wise, too good, or too great, to learn. The people must search the Scriptures, and so far as the ministers teach according to that rule, they ought to receive their instructions as the word of God, which works in those that believe. It is the interest of hearers, that the account their ministers give of them may be with joy, and not with grief. Faithful ministers deliver their own souls, but the ruin of a fruitless and faithless people will be upon their own heads. The more earnestly the people pray for their ministers, the more benefit they may expect from their ministry. A good conscience has respect to all God's commands, and all our duty. Those who have this good conscience, yet need the prayers of others. When ministers come to a people who pray for them, they come with greater satisfaction to themselves, and success to the people. We should seek all our mercies by prayer. God is the God of peace, fully reconciled to believers; who has made a way for peace and reconciliation between himself and sinners, and who loves peace on earth, especially in his churches. He is the Author of spiritual peace in the hearts and consciences of his people. How firm a covenant is that which has its foundation in the blood of the Son of God! The perfecting of the saints in every good work, is the great thing desired by them, and for them; and that they may at length be fitted for the employment and happiness of heaven. There is no good thing wrought in us, but it is the work of God. And no good thing is wrought in us by God, but through Christ, for his sake and by his Spirit.</body></html>
