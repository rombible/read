If so, it is a declaration, interposed among hortations, of the honorableness of the" estate of matrimony," with the hortatory purpose of suggesting this "remedy against sin "(as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>), or as a protest against false asceticism, such as is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>, "forbidding to marry." And certainly the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, taken by itself, would most naturally have this meaning. But most modern commentators understand it as an exhortation, supplying <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>; and this for the following cogent reasons: it occurs in the midst of a series of exhortations, and is therefore more likely to be one; it is difficult to understand the connected clause, "and the bed undefiled (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," as a statement; and the exactly similar phrase in ver. 5, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, seems evidently hortatory. Hence we take it to mean "Let marriage <span class="accented">be</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>." Two questions remain - that of the import of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is masculine or neuter. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> elsewhere, when applied to persons, means "held in honor" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34</a>, of Gamaliel); when applied to things, it means "precious" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>, of precious stones; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, of the blood of the Lamb; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>, of promises; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>, of "my own life;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>, of the fruit of the earth). Bengel explains thus: "Caelibes, quibus periculum scortationis imminet, hortatur ut matrimonium contrahant, tanquam <span class="accented">pretiosum</span> quiddam agnoscentes, ejusque bone digne utantur. Conf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>.' And, taking <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> as masculine, he explains further: "Omnesque debent matrimonium magni facere, ut, si quis eo ipse non utatur, alios tamen non prohibeat." According to this view the first clause is an injunction to all to appreciate marriage, the second warns those that are married against any violation of the bond: "<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> antitheton ad scortatotes, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ad adulteros" (Bengel). But the more natural, and the usual, meaning of the common expression <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "in all things," not "among all persons" (cf. <span class="accented">Jaffa</span>, ver. 18; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-9.htm">Titus 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>). If so here, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> must be taken rather as an injunction with respect to the sanctity of marriage when contracted: "Let it be held in honor in all respects; in all ways reverently regarded as a holy bond;" the succeeding clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, being a further explication of the same idea (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>, "<span class="accented">That</span> every one of you should know how to possess his own vessel [meaning, probably, as seems to be required by the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, 'get to himself his own <span class="accented">wife</span>] in sanctification and <span class="accented">honor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fc7;</span>);" where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fc7;</span> may express the same ides as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the text). 'In the conclusion of the verse "for" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) suits the drift of the sentence as above understood, and is considered to be supported better than "but" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) of the Textus Receptus. Observe, lastly, that, in "God will judge," "God" is emphatic, being placed last. Though the kind of sin spoken of is lightly regarded among men, and may escape detection or punishment now, yet certainly <span class="accented">God</span> will judge it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>, "God is the Avenger of all such, as we have also forewarned you and testified;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>, where fornicators and adulterers are included among those about whom Christians are not to deceive themselves, as though they would "inherit the kingdom of God"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 The design of Christ in giving himself for us, is, that he may purchase to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works; and true religion is the strongest bond of friendship. Here are earnest exhortations to several Christian duties, especially contentment. The sin opposed to this grace and duty is covetousness, an over-eager desire for the wealth of this world, with envy of those who have more than ourselves. Having treasures in heaven, we may be content with mean things here. Those who cannot be so, would not be content though God raised their condition. Adam was in paradise, yet not contented; some angels in heaven were not contented; but the apostle Paul, though abased and empty, had learned in every state, in any state, to be content. Christians have reason to be contented with their present lot. This promise contains the sum and substance of all the promises; I will never, no, never leave thee, no, never forsake thee. In the original there are no less than five negatives put together, to confirm the promise: the true believer shall have the gracious presence of God with him, in life, at death, and for ever. Men can do nothing against God, and God can make all that men do against his people, to turn to their good.</body></html>
