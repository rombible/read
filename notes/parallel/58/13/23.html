In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm" title=" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,">Colossians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a>, Timothy is spoken of as "the brother;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1Thessalonians 3:2</a>, and here, as "our brother" (for the word "our" printed in italics in the Authorised version, belongs to the true text). With him, the writer adds, "if he come shortly [sooner than the date at which he himself must depart], I will see you."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</span> This allusion to Timothy shows that the Epistle, whatever its exact date, was at any rate written in the apostolic age, before his death. Further, though not proving St. Paul's authorship, it supports the conclusion that the writer, if not himself, was one of his associates, Timothy having been peculiarly his disciple and companion. It seems that Timothy had been, as the readers were aware, in prison; and the joyful news is communicated of his release, and of the prospect of his visiting them. This again shows that the Epistle was addressed to a definite circle of readers. It is observable that the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which does not occur in St. Paul's writings, is, like so many expressions throughout the Epistle, one usual with St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-68.htm">Luke 22:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-16.htm">Luke 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-21.htm">Acts 4:21</a>; where it expresses release from prison or captivity). He uses it also for dismissal of persons on a mission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-30.htm">Acts 15:30</a>); and hence one view is that Timothy's having already set out to visit the Church addressed is all that is here meant. But the other meaning of the word is more likely. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:22-25 So bad are men, and even believers, through the remainders of their corruption, that when the most important, comfortable doctrine is delivered to them for their own good, and that with the most convincing evidence, there is need of earnest entreaty and exhortation that they would bear it, and not fall out with it, neglect it, or reject it. It is good to have the law of holy love and kindness written in the hearts of Christians, one towards another. Religion teaches men true civility and good breeding. It is not ill-tempered or uncourteous. Let the favour of God be toward you, and his grace continually working in you, and with you, bringing forth the fruits of holiness, as the first-fruits of glory.</body></html>
