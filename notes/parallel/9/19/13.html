We have no instance of the singular. The Latin equivalent, "penates," singularly enough, is also only found in the plural form. In this case, probably, it was a life-size figure or bust. The word has been discussed above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.">1Samuel 15:23</a>). It is singular how, in spite of the stern command to avoid idolatry, the children of Israel seemed to love to possess these lifeless images. The teraphim were probably a remnant of the idolatry originally brought by some of Abraham's family from their Chaldaean home. These idols, we know, varied in size, from the diminutive image which Rachel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-34.htm" title="Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.">Genesis 31:34</a>) was able to conceal under the camel saddle to the life-size figure which the Princess Michal here used to make her father's guards believe that her sick husband, David, was in bed. They appear to have been looked on as tutelary deities, the dispensers of domestic and family good fortune. It has been suggested, with some probability, that Michal, like Rachel, kept this teraphim in secret, because of her barrenness.<p><span class= "bld">A pillow of goats' hair.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">a goat's skin about its head. </span>So render the Syriac and Vulgate Versions. The reason of this act apparently was to imitate the effect of a man's hair round the teraphim's head. Its body, we read in the next clause, was covered "with a cloth." Some scholars have suggested that this goat's skin was a net-work of goat's hair to keep off the flies from the supposed sleeper. The LXX., instead of <span class= "ital">k'vir </span>(skin), read in their Hebrew copies <span class= "ital">keaved </span>(liver). As the vowel points were introduced much later, such a confusion (especially as the difference between <span class= "ital">d </span>and <span class= "ital">r </span>in Hebrew is very slight) would be likely enough to occur in the MSS.<p>Josephus, adopting the LXX. reading, explains Michal's conduct thus--"Michal put a palpitating goat's liver into the bed, to represent a breathing sick man."<p><span class= "bld">With a cloth.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">beged. </span>This was David's every-day garment, which he was in the habit of wearing. This, loosely thrown over the image, would materially assist the deception. The fifty-ninth Psalm bears the following title--"A michtam(or song of deep import) of David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him." The internal evidence, however, is scarcely confirmatory of the accuracy of the title. The sacred song in question is very probably one of David's own composition, and it is likely enough that the danger he incurred on this occasion was in his mind when he wrote the solemn words; but there are references in this psalm which must apply to other events in his troubled, anxious life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Michal took an image.</span> Literally, "the teraphim," a plural word, but used here as a singular. Probably, like the corresponding Latin word <span class="accented">penates</span>, it had no singular in common use. It was a wooden block with head and shoulders roughly shaped to represent a human figure. Laban's tera-phim were so small that Rachel could hide them under the camel's furniture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-34.htm">Genesis 31:34</a>), but Michal's seems to have been large enough to pass in the bed for a man. Though the worship of them is described as iniquity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>), yet the superstitious belief that they brought good luck to the house over which they presided, in return for kind treatment, seems to have been proof against the teaching of the prophets; and Hosea describes the absence of them as on the same level as the absence of the ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.</span> More correctly, "a goat's skin about its head." So the Syriac and Vulgate. The object of it, would be to look at a distance like a man s hair. The Septuagint has a goat's liver, because this was supposed to palpitate long after the animal's death, and so would produce the appearance of a person's breathing. But this involves a different reading, for which there is no authority; nor was Michal's deception intended for close observation. She would of course not let any one disturb David, and all she wanted was just enough likeness to a man to make a person at a distance suppose that David was there. Soon or later her artifice would be found out, but her husband would have had the intervening time for effecting his escape. As the word rendered <span class="cmt_word">pillow</span>, and which is found only here, comes from a root signifying "to knot together," "to intertwine," some commentators think that it means a network of goats' hair, perhaps to keep off flies. But this is a mere guess, and not to be set against the combined authority of the two versions. <span class="cmt_word">With a cloth.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">beged.</span> This <span class="accented">beged</span> was David's every day dress, and would greatly aid Michal in her pious artifice. It was a loose mantle, worn over the close-fitting <span class="accented">meil</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-19.htm">1 Samuel 2:19</a>). Thus Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3, 5</a>) says, "I rent my <span class="accented">beged</span> and my <span class="accented">meil</span>," which the A.V. with characteristic inexactness translates "my garment and my mantle." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">raiment</span>, Jacob speaks of it as the most indispensable article of dress; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-12.htm">Genesis 39:12</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">garment</span>, we find that it was a loose plaid or wrapper. In those simple days it was used for warmth by night as well as for protection by day, and it is interesting to find David in his old age still covered up for warmth in bed by his <span class="accented">beged</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-1.htm">1 Kings 1:1</a>), where it is translated <span class="accented">clothes.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:11-24 Michal's stratagem to gain time till David got to a distance was allowable, but her falsehood had not even the plea of necessity to excuse it, and manifests that she was not influenced by the same spirit of piety which had dictated Jonathan's language to Saul. In flying to Samuel, David made God his refuge. Samuel, as a prophet, was best able to advise him what to do in this day of distress. He met with little rest or satisfaction in Saul's court, therefore went to seek it in Samuel's church. What little pleasure is to be had in this world, those have who live a life of communion with God; to that David returned in the time of trouble. So impatient was Saul after David's blood, so restless against him, that although baffled by one providence after another, he could not see that David was under the special protection of God. And when God will take this way to protect David, even Saul prophesies. Many have great gifts, yet no grace; they may prophesy in Christ's name, yet are disowned by him. Let us daily seek for renewing grace, which shall be in us as a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Let us cleave to truth and holiness with full purpose of heart. In every danger and trouble, let us seek protection, comfort, and direction in God's ordinances.</body></html>
