Naturally, such a deed as that of Jonathan's would at once arouse Philistia.<p><span class= "bld">And the people were called together.</span>--Gradually round the King of Israel the fighting men of the nation in great numbers were gathered. This seems to have been by no means a "levee en masse" of all the people; they seem to have come together very slowly, and very quickly again to have dispersed. The hour for a decisive blow was not yet come. Something, as we shall soon see, prevented Saul, with all his gallantry and splendid military skill, from winning popular confidence. (On Gilgal, the place where Saul was trying to assemble the people at this juncture, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm" title="And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.">1Samuel 13:8</a> and <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>E at the end of this Book.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That Saul had smitten.</span> Though the achievement was actually Jonathan's, yet it belonged to Saul as the commander-in-chief, and probably had been done under his instructions. <span class="cmt_word">Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines.</span> They must have viewed with grave displeasure Israel's gathering together to choose a king, and Saul's subsequent defeat of the Ammonites, and retention with him of a large body of men, and so probably they had been for some time making preparations for war. Saul, therefore, knowing that they were collecting their forces, does the same, <span class="cmt_word">and the people were called together after Saul.</span> Literally, "were cried after him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were summoned by proclamation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>, where see margin).

This place had been selected because, as the valley opens there into the plain of Jordan it was a fit spot for the assembling of a large host. For its identification see Conder, 'Tent Work,' 2:7-12. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 Saul reigned one year, and nothing particular happened; but in his second year the events recorded in this chapter took place. For above a year he gave the Philistine time to prepare for war, and to weaken and to disarm the Israelites. When men are lifted up in self-sufficiency, they are often led into folly. The chief advantages of the enemies of the church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends. When Saul at length sounded an alarm, the people, dissatisfied with his management, or terrified by the power of the enemy, did not come to him, or speedily deserted him.</body></html>
