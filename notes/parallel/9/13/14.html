As David was but twenty-three years of age at Saul's death, he must now have been a mere child, even if he was born, (see ver. 1). But the Divine choice of Saul, which upon his obedience would that day have been confirmed, was now annulled, and the succession transferred elsewhere. Years might elapse before the first earthly step was taken to appoint his successor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>); nay, had Saul repented, we gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a> that he might have been forgiven: for God's threatenings, like his promises, are conditional. There is no fatalism in the Bible, but a loving discipline for man's recovery.
