This accounts for the great numbers alluded to in the text: "People as the sand which <span class= "ital">is </span>on the sea shore in multitude" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm" title="And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.">1Samuel 13:5</a>). The hearts of the as yet undisciplined Hebrews sank at the tidings of such an invasion. And in high places.--The word in the original Hebrew is not the same as the one usually rendered "high places" for prayer and sacrifice. The word here signifies towers. It is the same word which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm" title="And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.">Judges 9:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-49.htm" title="And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.">Judges 9:49</a> is translated "a hold." In the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary </span>it is suggested that it was applied to a particular kind of tower which was the work of the old Canaanite inhabitants, and which remained as ruins in the time of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people were distressed.</span> Literally, were squeezed, pressed together, were in difficulties. The Philistines had so promptly answered Saul's challenge, that the Israelites, forgetting their victory over Nahash, whose men, however, had probably very inferior arms to those worn by the Philistines, lost courage; and even the picked band of 2000 men dwindled to 600. As for the mass of the people, they acted with the most abject cowardice, hiding themselves in <span class="cmt_word">caves</span>, of which there are very many in the limestone ranges of Palestine. David subsequently found safety in them when hunted by Saul. Also <span class="cmt_word">in thickets.</span> The word as spelt here occurs nowhere else, nor do the versions agree as to its meaning. Most probably it signifies <span class="accented">clefts</span>, rifts or fissures in the <span class="cmt_word">rocks</span>. The next word, rocks, certainly means precipitous <span class="accented">cliffs</span>; and thickets or thorn bushes would scarcely be placed between caverns and cliffs, both of which belong to mountains. <span class="cmt_word">In high places.</span> This word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46, 49</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">hold.</span> But this meaning is not supported by the ancient versions, and it more probably signifies a vault or crypt, which better suits the hiding place next mentioned, <span class="cmt_word">pits</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> tanks, artificial reservoirs for water, with which most districts were well supplied in Palestine, even before its conquest by Israel. They were absolutely necessary, as the rains fall only at stated periods, and the chalky soil will not hold water; when dry they would form fit places for concealment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 Saul reigned one year, and nothing particular happened; but in his second year the events recorded in this chapter took place. For above a year he gave the Philistine time to prepare for war, and to weaken and to disarm the Israelites. When men are lifted up in self-sufficiency, they are often led into folly. The chief advantages of the enemies of the church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends. When Saul at length sounded an alarm, the people, dissatisfied with his management, or terrified by the power of the enemy, did not come to him, or speedily deserted him.</body></html>
