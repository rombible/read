This fact is especially dwelt upon, for the Philistines appear to have armed their fighting men to the teeth. (Compare the description of their champion, Goliath, who is described as "clad in armour.")<p><span class= "bld">But with Saul.</span>--These words probably signify that the companies of regulars, who throughout this disastrous period were always with the king and prince, were--in contrast to the country people around--fully armed.

The Ammonites probably were far less efficiently armed than the Philistines, who, as commanding the sea coast, could import weapons from Greece. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:15-23 See how politic the Philistines were when they had power; they not only prevented the people of Israel from making weapons of war, but obliged them to depend upon their enemies, even for instruments of husbandry. How impolitic Saul was, who did not, in the beginning of his reign, set himself to redress this. Want of true sense always accompanies want of grace. Sins which appear to us very little, have dangerous consequences. Miserable is a guilty, defenceless nation; much more those who are destitute of the whole armour of God.</body></html>
