so most of the older versions. We cannot now with any precision distinguish between these two implements of tillage.<p><span class= "bld">And his mattock.</span>--Jerome renders the Hebrew word here by "hoe" (sarculum).

This could only have applied to the districts near the Philistines, unless we suppose that they set up forges also at their garrisons. <span class="cmt_word">To sharpen.</span> The verb chiefly refers to such work as required an anvil and hammer. As regards the implements, not only do the versions disagree in their renderings, but the Septuagint has a very curious different reading, to the effect that at harvest time the Israelites had to pay the Philistines three shekels for repairing and whetting their tools. The <span class="cmt_word">share</span> is more probably a <span class="accented">sickle.</span> The <span class="cmt_word">coulter</span> is certainly a <span class="accented">ploughshare</span>, as rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>. Of the <span class="cmt_word">ax</span> there is no doubt; and the <span class="cmt_word">mattock</span> is a heavy hoe for turning up the ground, as spades for that purpose are scarcely anywhere used, except in our own country. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:15-23 See how politic the Philistines were when they had power; they not only prevented the people of Israel from making weapons of war, but obliged them to depend upon their enemies, even for instruments of husbandry. How impolitic Saul was, who did not, in the beginning of his reign, set himself to redress this. Want of true sense always accompanies want of grace. Sins which appear to us very little, have dangerous consequences. Miserable is a guilty, defenceless nation; much more those who are destitute of the whole armour of God.</body></html>
