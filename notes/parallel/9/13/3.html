he is everywhere the first in courage and activity and speed, slender also, and of well-made figure. This personal beauty and swiftness of foot in attack or retreat gained for him among the troops the name of "gazelle." (The first lines of the song, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-19.htm" title="The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!">2Samuel 1:19</a>, can only be explained on the supposition that Jonathan was well known by this name in the army.) "In all this, as in his uprightness and fidelity, he showed himself the right worthy son of a king."--Ewald. Some translate the word rightly rendered "garrison" as "pillar," a sign of the authority of the Philistines; others--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Ewald--as a proper name, supposing that the officer appointed to collect tribute from Israel in that part of the country is meant.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul blew the trumpet.</span>--This was evidently more than a communication of good news to the people. Saul intended it as a summons to Israel to prepare at once for war.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In Geba.</span> By this garrison the Philistines commanded the further end of the defile, and they had also another outpost beyond it near Gibeah itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). Probably neither of these garrisons was very strong, and Saul may have intended that Jonathan should attack them while he held the northern end of the pass, which would be the first place assailed by the Philistines in force. As regards the word translated <span class="accented">garrison</span>, attempts have been made to render it <span class="accented">pillar</span>, and to represent it as a token of Philistine supremacy which Jonathan threw down, while others, with the Septuagint, take it as a proper name; but the word <span class="accented">smote</span> is strongly in favour of the rendering of the A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Let the Hebrews hear.</span> Saul must have intended war when he thus posted himself and Jonathan in such commanding spots, and probably all this had been sketched out by Samuel (see on 1 Samuel 10:8). He now summons all Israel to the war. It is strange that he should call the people "Hebrews," the Philistine title of contempt; but it is used again in ver. 7, and of course in ver. 19. The Septuagint reads, "Let the slaves revolt," but though followed by Josephus, the change of text is not probable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 Saul reigned one year, and nothing particular happened; but in his second year the events recorded in this chapter took place. For above a year he gave the Philistine time to prepare for war, and to weaken and to disarm the Israelites. When men are lifted up in self-sufficiency, they are often led into folly. The chief advantages of the enemies of the church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends. When Saul at length sounded an alarm, the people, dissatisfied with his management, or terrified by the power of the enemy, did not come to him, or speedily deserted him.</body></html>
