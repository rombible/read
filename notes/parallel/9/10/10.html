the estate of the house of Kish lay evidently in the immediate vicinity of Gibeah, henceforward to be known as Saul's royal city, "Gibeah of Saul." "As he walked, the Spirit of God came upon him," we read. The coming of the Spirit of God upon him may be looked on as the sequel of that Divine gift of the new heart bestowed on him in the early morning, when he left Ramah. The changed heart was a fit home for that Divine Spirit which came on him in the eventide, as he drew near to his ancestral city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the hill.</span> Hebrew, "to Gibeah," his home. <span class="cmt_word">He prophesied.</span> Took part in prophetic exercises (see on Ver. 5). On seeing this, the people of Gibeah, <span class="cmt_word">who knew him beforetime</span>, - Hebrew, "from yesterday and the day before," but equivalent to our phrase "for years," - asked in surprise, <span class="cmt_word">What is this that is come unto the son of Kish?</span> What makes him thus act in a manner unlike all our long past experience of him? <span class="cmt_word">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> From this question two things are evident: the first, that the schools founded by Samuel already held a high place in the estimation of the Israelites; the second, that Saul had not shared in that education which so raised the prophets as a class above, the mass of the people. Probably also Saul s character was not such as would have made him care for education. A young man who, while living in his neighbourhood, knew so little about Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a>), could not have had a very inquiring or intellectual frame of mind. Of course Samuel could not, by gathering young men together, and giving them the best education the times afforded, gain for them also the highest and rarest of gifts, that of direct inspiration. Even when Elisha, the friend and attendant upon Elijah, asked his master for an elder son's portion of the Divine spirit, Elijah told him that he had asked a hard thing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>). The disparity then that the people remarked between Saul and the prophets was that between a rich young farmer's son, who had been brought up at home, and cared only for rustic things, and these young collegians, who were enjoying a careful education (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a>). How good that education was is proved by the fact that at David's court all posts which required literary skill were held by prophets. No man could found schools of inspired men; but Samuel founded great educational institutions, which ended by making the Israelites a highly trained and literary people. Saul's prophesying was not the result of training, but came to him by a Divine influence, rousing the slumbering enthusiasm of an energetic but fitful nature. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:9-16 The signs Samuel had given Saul, came to pass punctually; he found that God had given him another heart, another disposition of mind. Yet let not an outward show of devotion, and a sudden change for the present, be too much relied on; Saul among the prophets was Saul still. His being anointed was kept private. He leaves it to God to carry on his own work by Samuel, and sits still, to see how the matter will fall.</body></html>
