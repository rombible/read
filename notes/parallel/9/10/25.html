The vice-gerent on earth of the invisible King could be no arbitrary despot, unless he transgressed plainly and openly the "manner of the kingdom" written in a book, and laid up before the Lord by Samuel.<p>This sacred document, we may assume, contained, too, the exact details of the singular story of the choice of the first king of Israel. It was well, no doubt, thought Samuel, that coming ages should know exactly how it came to pass that he, the seer, anointed the Benjamite of Gibeah as king over the Lord's inheritance. We may, therefore, fairly conclude that from the record laid up among the sacred archives in the sanctuary, the compiler or redactor of this "Book of Samuel" derived his intimate knowledge of every little fact connected with the Divine choice of Saul.<p>The legal portion of this writing respecting the kingdom was, of course, strictly based upon what Moses had already written on this subject in Deuteronomy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-14.htm" title="And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.">1Samuel 17:14-20</a>).<p>We find here, in this writing of Samuel, the first trace of literary composition among the Israelites since the days of Moses. The great revival in letters which began shortly after the days of Saul was due, most probably, to the influence of Samuel and those great schools of the prophets which he had established in the land.<p><span class= "bld">And laid it up before the Lord.</span>--We are not told where this was done, but the words seem to imply that the document, or roll, was placed by the side of the Ark, then in the "city of woods," Kiriath-yearim. Josephus says this writing was preserved in the Tabernacle of the Holy of Holies, where the Book of the Law had been laid up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm" title="Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And Samuel sent all the people away.</span>--It is noteworthy that even after the formal popular ratification of Saul's election as king, it is <span class= "ital">Samuel </span>who dismisses the assembly. Indeed, throughout the remainder of the great seer's life, whenever he appears on the scene, he is evidently the principal person, occupying a position above king or priest. On the other hand, after this period Samuel made but comparatively few public appearances; of his own free will he seems to have retired into privacy, and only in emergencies to have left his retirement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The manner.</span> The difficult word already discussed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>. Here, however, it is not used for rights so exercised as to become wrongs, but in a good sense, for what we should call a <span class="accented">constitution.</span> The heathen kings were despots, subject to no higher law, and Samuel, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11-18</a>, speaks with merited abhorrence of their violation of the natural rights of their subjects; but under the theocracy the king's power was limited by laws which protected, in the enjoyment of their privileges, the people, the priests, and the prophets. The latter class especially, as being the mouthpiece of Jehovah, formed a powerful check upon the development of despotic tendencies. In sketching Saul's kingly rights Samuel would be guided by <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>, and would give the king his true position as the representative of Jehovah both in all matters of internal administration and of war. <span class="cmt_word">And laid it up before Jehovah.</span> Probably by the side of the ark. We are not to suppose that Samuel wrote this at Mizpah. He would fully explain to Saul and the people there what a theocratic king ought to be, and would afterwards draw up a formal document both as a memorial of what had been done, and for the use of future sovereigns, and place it within the sanctuary. It is noteworthy that this is the first notice of writing since the days of the illustrious scribe Eleazar. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:17-27 Samuel tells the people, Ye have this day rejected your God. So little fond was Saul now of that power, which soon after, when he possessed it, he could not think of parting with, that he hid himself. It is good to be conscious of our unworthiness and insufficiency for the services to which we are called; but men should not go into the contrary extreme, by refusing the employments to which the Lord and the church call them. The greater part of the people treated the matter with indifference. Saul modestly went home to his own house, but was attended by a band of men whose hearts God disposed to support his authority. If the heart bend at any time the right way, it is because He has touched it. One touch is enough when it is Divine. Others despised him. Thus differently are men affected to our exalted Redeemer. There is a remnant who submit to him, and follow him wherever he goes; they are those whose hearts God has touched, whom he has made willing. But there are others who despise him, who ask, How shall this man save us? They are offended in him, and they will be punished.</body></html>
