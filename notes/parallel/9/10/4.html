By so doing, in the first place, they acknowledged him as their lord (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>), and, secondly, they indicated that the king would henceforth share with the sanctuary the offerings of the people. And Saul was to <span class="cmt_word">receive of their hands</span> the present, as being now his due, for by anointing him Samuel had designated him as king. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 The sacred anointing, then used, pointed at the great Messiah, or Anointed One, the King of the church, and High Priest of our profession, who was anointed with the oil of the Spirit, not by measure, but without measure, and above all the priests and princes of the Jewish church. For Saul's further satisfaction, Samuel gives him some signs which should come to pass the same day. The first place he directs him to, was the sepulchre of one of his ancestors; there he must be reminded of his own mortality, and now that he had a crown before him, must think of his grave, in which all his honour would be laid in the dust. From the time of Samuel there appears to have been schools, or places where pious young men were brought up in the knowledge of Divine things. Saul should find himself strongly moved to join with them, and should be turned into another man from what he had been. The Spirit of God changes men, wonderfully transforms them. Saul, by praising God in the communion of saints, became another man, but it may be questioned if he became a new man.</body></html>
