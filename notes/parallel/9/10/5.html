The name of Gibeah, or Hill of God, was given to it on account of a well-known high place or sacrificial height in or hard by the town. We know that this sacred place was chosen by Samuel as the site of one of his "schools of the prophets."<p><span class= "bld">Where is the garrison of the Philistines.</span>--These warlike Ph?nician tribes seem gradually, after their great defeat at Mizpeh, to have again established themselves in various stations of the land, whence they harried the Israelites. A parallel to these marauding soldiers, so long the plague of Israel, might be found in the countless freebooters' strongholds which, in the Middle Ages, were the curse especially of Germany, the terror of the peaceful trading folk of the rich countries of Central Europe.<p><span class= "bld">A company of prophets.</span>--These evidently belonged to one of those seminaries termed "schools of the prophets," founded by Samuel for the training of young men. The foundation of these schools in different parts of the country was one of the greatest of the works of this noble and patriotic man. These schools seem to have flourished during the whole period of the monarchy, and in no small measure contributed to the moral and mental development of the people. Some of the youth of Israel who received in these schools their training became public preachers of the Word; for after all, this, rather than foretelling future events, was the grand duty of the prophet's calling.<p>It is a grave mistake to conclude that <span class= "ital">all, </span>or even the greater part, of these young men trained in the "schools of the prophets" were <span class= "ital">inspired </span>in the usual sense of the word. The aim of these institutions, beside high mental culture, seems to have been to train the youth of Israel to love, and then live, noble pure lives. Dean Payne Smith calls attention to the remarkable fact that at David's court all posts which required literary skill were held by "prophets." He considers that it was owing to these great educational institutions which Samuel founded that the Israelites became a highly trained and literary people. "Prophets," in the awful sense of the word as used by us--men who, as compared with their fellows, stood in a different relation to the Most High, who heard things which other men heard not, and saw visions unseen by any save themselves--men before whose eyes the veil which hid the dark future now and again was raised--were, after all, even among the people of God, very rare. In the course of a generation, one or two, or perhaps three, appeared, and were listened to, and their words in many cases, we know, preserved. These, for the most part, we may assume, received their early training in the "schools of the prophets," but these famous institutions were never, as has often been popularly supposed, established in the hope of training up and developing such men, but were founded and supported with the intention of fostering what we should call the higher education in Israel; and in this, we know from the outset, these schools were eminently successful.<p>Dr. Erdmann, in <span class= "ital">Lange's Commentary, </span>accounts for this especial mention of the music which we know, from this and other passages, was carefully cultivated in these seminaries of the sons of the prophets, by suggesting that in these societies religious feeling was nourished and heightened by sacred music. It would be a mistake to attribute to this carefully cultivated music and singing that condition of ecstatic inspiration into which some of these companies appear to have at times fallen. We understand and know, however, very little respecting this state of ecstasy--what produced it, and how it affected those who had fallen into this strange condition. The object of the musical teaching of the schools of the prophets was, no doubt, to enable those who had studied in the seminaries to guide and direct the religious gatherings of the people, into which--as we know from the subsequent Temple service, the model of all popular sacred gatherings for worship--music and psalmody entered so largely.<p>With a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them.--The four instruments here mentioned indicate that even in this--which is often termed a semi-barbarous age--music had been long and carefully studied. The <span class= "ital">psaltery </span>(<span class= "ital">nevel</span>) was a species of lyre with ten strings, in shape like an inverted delta v, and was played with the fingers. The <span class= "ital">tabret </span>(<span class= "ital">toph</span>) was a hand-drum--a tambourine. Miriam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>) is represented as using it to accompany her triumph song. The <span class= "ital">pipe </span>(<span class= "ital">chalil</span>) was a flute of reed, wood, or horn, and seems to have been ever a favourite instrument among the children of Israel. The <span class= "ital">harp </span>(<span class= "ital">cinnor</span>) was a stringed instrument, like the psaltery, only apparently larger, and was played usually with a plectrum. David, however, is represented in several psalms as playing on the <span class= "ital">"</span>cinnor" with his fingers.<p><span class= "bld">And they shall prophesy.</span>--In this case the company from the "School of the Prophets" were, no doubt, singing some hymns or psalms in praise of the Eternal to the accompaniment of their musical instruments. Saul, as he drew near his home at Gibeah, would meet these men coming down from sacrificing on the high place of God, and as he listened to the sweet pure sounds he would be sensible of a something indescribable taking possession of his whole being; new thoughts--high grand thoughts--would chase away the aspirations and hopes of the past. Through his <span class= "ital">heart </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-9.htm" title="And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.">1Samuel 10:9</a>) would flash the memory of what Samuel had told him when alone on the house-top at Ramah--of the glory and future of Israel; a conviction would steal over him that <span class= "ital">he </span>was the man of the future chosen by the Eternal to work His will among His people. The Saul of the vineyards and the corn-fields of the farm on the Ephraim hills would die, and a new hero-Saul would be born; and although quite untrained and untaught in the elaborate music of the choirs of the sons of the prophets, the really inspired Saul would lift up his voice in the choruses singing before him, and join with a new strange power in their glorious hymn to the Eternal--would pour out his whole heart and soul in thanksgiving to his God. Thus would the Spirit of the Lord come upon him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The third sign was to be his taking part with the prophets in their religious exercises in <span class="cmt_word">the hill of God</span> - really Gibeah, his own home. Gibeah is strictly a rounded hill, while Ramah is a height. This <span class="accented">Gibeah ha-Elohim</span> was probably that part of the hill on which the "high place" was situated, and which was evidently outside the city; for Saul, on his route homeward, met the troop of prophets descending from it. For "Gibeah of Saul" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; but, as Conder remarks, this name was given to a district as well as to a town, inasmuch as Ramah is described as situated within it - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a> ('Tent Work,' 2:111). <span class="cmt_word">The garrison of the Philistines</span> was probably on some height in this district, and, coupled with the mention of similar military posts elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4</a>), shows that most of the tribe of Benjamin was subject to that nation, and disarmed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>); but probably, as long as the tribute was paid, its internal administration was not interfered with <span class="cmt_word">A company of the prophets.</span> At Gibeah Samuel had established one of his "schools of the prophets," by means of which he did so much to elevate the whole mental and moral state of the Israelites. The word rendered <span class="accented">company</span> literally means a cord or line, and so a band of people. These prophets were descending from the Bamah (see on 1 Samuel 9:12), where they had been engaged in some religious exercise, and were chanting a psalm or hymn to the music of various instruments. Music was one of the great means employed by Samuel in training his young men; and not only is its effect at all times elevating and refining, but in semi-barbarous times, united, as it is sure to be, with poetry, it is the chief educational lever for raising men's minds, and giving them a taste for culture and intellectual pleasures. The musical instruments mentioned are the <span class="cmt_word">psaltery</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">nebel, a</span> sort of harp with ten strings stretched across a triangle, the longest string being at its base, and the shortest towards its apex; the <span class="cmt_word">tabret</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">toph</span>, a tambourine struck by the hand; the <span class="cmt_word">pipe</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">chalil, i.e.</span> "bored" or "pierced," so called from the holes bored in it to make the notes, and being probably a sort of flute; and, lastly, the <span class="cmt_word">harp</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">cinnor</span>, a sort of guitar, chiefly used for accompanying the voice, and sometimes played with the fingers, and sometimes with a plectrum or quill. There is nothing to indicate that there was only one of each of these instruments, so that the articles would be better omitted. No doubt every prophet was playing some one or other of them. And they shall prophesy. The conjugation used here is not that employed for the prediction of future events, but means, literally, and they will be acting the prophet, the right word for men who were in training for the prophetic office (see 'Prophecy a Preparation for Christ,' 2nd ed. p. 50). They were really engaged in chanting God's praises with fervour, and this was no doubt one of the methods employed by Samuel to refine and spiritualise their minds. Years afterwards David was thus educated, and learned at one of Samuel's schools that skill in metre and psalmody which, added to his natural gifts, made him "the sweet singer of Israel." For <span class="accented">prophesying</span>, in the sense of playing instruments of music see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-3</a>, and in the sense of chanting, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-29.htm">1 Kings 18:29</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 The sacred anointing, then used, pointed at the great Messiah, or Anointed One, the King of the church, and High Priest of our profession, who was anointed with the oil of the Spirit, not by measure, but without measure, and above all the priests and princes of the Jewish church. For Saul's further satisfaction, Samuel gives him some signs which should come to pass the same day. The first place he directs him to, was the sepulchre of one of his ancestors; there he must be reminded of his own mortality, and now that he had a crown before him, must think of his grave, in which all his honour would be laid in the dust. From the time of Samuel there appears to have been schools, or places where pious young men were brought up in the knowledge of Divine things. Saul should find himself strongly moved to join with them, and should be turned into another man from what he had been. The Spirit of God changes men, wonderfully transforms them. Saul, by praising God in the communion of saints, became another man, but it may be questioned if he became a new man.</body></html>
