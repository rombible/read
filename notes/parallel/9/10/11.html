It need not be assumed that the youth and early manhood of the future king had been wild and dissolute, but simply that the way of life had been rough and uncultured--a life spent in what we should call "country pursuits," in contradistinction to the pursuit of knowledge and of higher acquirements. It is evident from the statement here and in the following verse that a considerable respect for these schools had already grown up among the people.<p><span class= "bld">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm" title="And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.">1Samuel 19:23</a> we again find Saul, but under changed circumstances, under the influence of a Divine and coercing power, and uttering strange words, and singing hymns as one trained in the prophets' schools. It was probably this recurrence of the same incident in the king's life which gave rise to the saying, or proverb, which expresses amazement at the unexpected appearance of any man in a position which had hitherto been quite strange to him. "Is Saul among the preachers of Christ? Was a question of wonder asked by the friends of St. Paul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm" title="But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed.">Galatians 1:23</a>).--<span class= "ital">Wordsworth.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:9-16 The signs Samuel had given Saul, came to pass punctually; he found that God had given him another heart, another disposition of mind. Yet let not an outward show of devotion, and a sudden change for the present, be too much relied on; Saul among the prophets was Saul still. His being anointed was kept private. He leaves it to God to carry on his own work by Samuel, and sits still, to see how the matter will fall.</body></html>
