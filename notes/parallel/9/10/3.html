There was evidently a history, now lost, connected with the "terebinth of Tabor." Ewald suggests that "Tabor" is a different form for Deborah, and that this historic tree was the oak beneath which Deborah, the nurse of Rachel, was buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm" title="But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.">Genesis 35:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Going up to God to Beth-el.</span>--This since the old patriarchal days had been a sacred spot. Samuel used to visit it as judge, and hold his court there annually, no doubt on account of the number of pilgrims who were in the habit of visiting it. These men were evidently on a pilgrimage to the old famous shrine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> The second sign was to be the presenting of an offering to him out of their sacrificial gifts by three men going on a pilgrimage to Bethel. He would meet them not <span class="cmt_word">in the plain of Tabor,</span> but at the oak, <span class="accented">elon</span>, of Tabor. Many attempt to connect this <span class="accented">elon-Tabor</span> with the <span class="accented">allon</span>, or oak, under which Deborah, Rachel's nurse, was buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>), and suppose that Tabor is a corruption of the name Deborah. This is scarcely possible, and it is better to acknowledge that we know nothing of the site of this tree, except that it was on the road to Bethel. This was one of the places which Samuel used to visit as judge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>); but these men were on a pilgrimage thither because since the days of Jacob it had been a sacred spot, and a chief seat of the old patriarchal worship, for which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 The sacred anointing, then used, pointed at the great Messiah, or Anointed One, the King of the church, and High Priest of our profession, who was anointed with the oil of the Spirit, not by measure, but without measure, and above all the priests and princes of the Jewish church. For Saul's further satisfaction, Samuel gives him some signs which should come to pass the same day. The first place he directs him to, was the sepulchre of one of his ancestors; there he must be reminded of his own mortality, and now that he had a crown before him, must think of his grave, in which all his honour would be laid in the dust. From the time of Samuel there appears to have been schools, or places where pious young men were brought up in the knowledge of Divine things. Saul should find himself strongly moved to join with them, and should be turned into another man from what he had been. The Spirit of God changes men, wonderfully transforms them. Saul, by praising God in the communion of saints, became another man, but it may be questioned if he became a new man.</body></html>
