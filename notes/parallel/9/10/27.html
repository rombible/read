[Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the people of Gad and Reuben who lived east of the Jordan River. He gouged out the right eye of each of the Israelites living there, and he didn't allow anyone to come and rescue them. In fact, of all the Israelites east of the Jordan, there wasn't a single one whose right eye Nahash had not gouged out. But there were 7,000 men who had escaped from the Ammonites, and they had settled in Jabesh-gilead.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/1_samuel/10.htm">English Standard Version</a></span><br />But some worthless fellows said, &#8220;How can this man save us?&#8221; And they despised him and brought him no present.

No one was left among the Israelis across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out.

It will be remembered that the tribe of Benjamin had been almost entirely destroyed in the civil war related in the concluding chapters of Judges. "They despised him," because in no way had he made his mark, either in the arts of war or peace. From what has gone before (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?">1Samuel 10:11-12</a> of this 1Sam) it is evident that Saul was a man of no special culture; his early years had been spent in agriculture and work on his father's lands in the neighbourhood of Gibeah.<p><span class= "bld">And brought him no presents.</span>--These gifts were, in the East, the token of submission and homage; not to offer them to Saul was almost the same thing as to ignore his authority. Although not stated, it is clear that these malcontents were among the chiefs of the greater tribes who had assisted at the election.<p><span class= "bld">But he held his peace.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">he was a deaf man, </span>acting as though he had not heard the murmurs. This prudent conduct showed great self-control and self-denial on the part of the new king and his counsellors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:17-27 Samuel tells the people, Ye have this day rejected your God. So little fond was Saul now of that power, which soon after, when he possessed it, he could not think of parting with, that he hid himself. It is good to be conscious of our unworthiness and insufficiency for the services to which we are called; but men should not go into the contrary extreme, by refusing the employments to which the Lord and the church call them. The greater part of the people treated the matter with indifference. Saul modestly went home to his own house, but was attended by a band of men whose hearts God disposed to support his authority. If the heart bend at any time the right way, it is because He has touched it. One touch is enough when it is Divine. Others despised him. Thus differently are men affected to our exalted Redeemer. There is a remnant who submit to him, and follow him wherever he goes; they are those whose hearts God has touched, whom he has made willing. But there are others who despise him, who ask, How shall this man save us? They are offended in him, and they will be punished.</body></html>
