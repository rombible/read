Ewald considers that it was during the residence at Gath that David exercised himself as a musician in the Gittite--i.e., the Philistine--style, which he afterwards transferred from there to Judah and Jerusalem. (See titles of Psalms 8, 81, 84, "upon the Gittith.") Gittith is a feminine adjective derived from Gath; the words possibly signify, "after the Gittith manner: some peculiar measure of style of Philistine music, or else the reference may be to a Philistine musical instrument."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-7 Unbelief is a sin that easily besets even good men, when without are fightings, and within are fears; and it is a hard matter to get over them. Lord, increase our faith! We may blush to think that the word of a Philistine should go further than the word of an Israelite, and that the city of Gath should be a place of refuge for a good man, when the cities of Israel refuse him a safe abode. David gained a comfortable settlement, not only at a distance from Gath, but bordering upon Israel, where he might keep up a correspondence with his own countrymen.</body></html>
