The nomad tribes against whom his expeditions were directed dwelt on higher ground than David's home at Ziklag, apparently on the wide extent of the mountain plateau, that high table-land at the north-east of the desert of Paran.<p><span class= "bld">The Geshurites, and the Gezerites, and the Amalekites.</span>--These were all "Bedaween" tribes, the scourge of the Israelitish families dwelling on the south of Canaan. It is not easy to identify the first two named of these nomades against whom David directed his operations. We hear of these Geshurites in the neighbourhood of Bashan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>), and of another tribe of them in Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-8.htm" title="For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.">2Samuel 15:8</a>). They were a widely scattered race of nomad Arabs. The Gezerites, or Gizrites, it has been supposed, were the remains of a once powerful race dispossessed by the Amorites. The third named, the Amalekites, were the remnant of that once powerful tribe destroyed by Saul in his famous war, when his disobedience incurred the wrath of Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">For those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.</span>--The grammar and construction of this sentence is confused and difficult. On the whole, the rendering and explanation of Erdmann in <span class= "ital">Lange </span>seems the most satisfactory: "David . . . invaded the . . . and the Amalekites (for these were inhabitants of the land, who inhabited it of old) as far as Shur and Egypt." Thus David's raids extended as far as the desert frontier of Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went up.</span> The Geshurites inhabited the high table land which forms the northeastern portion of the wilderness of Paran. Like the Kenites, they seem to have broken up into scattered tribes, as we find one portion of them in the neighbourhood of Bashan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>), and another in Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>). Probably, like the Amalekites, they were a Bedouin race, and so great wanderers. Hence the verb translated <span class="cmt_word">invaded</span> is literally "spread themselves out" like a fan, so as to enclose these nomads, whose safety lay in flight. <span class="cmt_word">Gezrites</span>. The written text has <span class="accented">Girzites</span>, which the Kri has changed into Gezrites, probably from a wish to connect a name never mentioned elsewhere with the town of Gezer. But Gezer lay far away in the west of Ephraim, and the connection suggested in modern times of the Girzites with Mount Gerizim in Central Palestine is more probable. They would thus be the remains of a once more powerful people, dispossessed by the Amorites, but who were now probably a very feeble remnant. <span class="cmt_word">For those nations,</span> etc. The grammar and translation of this clause are both full of difficulties, but the following rendering is perhaps the least objectionable: "For these were (the families) inhabiting the land, which were of old, as thou goest towards Shur," etc. <span class="accented">Families</span> must be supplied because the participle <span class="accented">inhabiting</span> is feminine. What, then, the narrator means to say is that these three Bedouin tribes were the aboriginal inhabitants of the northwestern portion of the desert between Egypt and South Palestine. On the Amalekites see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2</a>. We need not wonder at finding them mentioned again so soon after Saul's expedition. A race of nomads would sustain no great harm from an expedition which soon began to occupy itself with capturing cattle. On <span class="cmt_word">Shur</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:8-12 While David was in the land of the Philistines, he attacked some remains of the devoted nations. The people whom he cut off were long before doomed to destruction. It is often wisdom to shun public notice, but we must in no situation be idle. We must always try to do somewhat in the cause of God. This expedition David hid from Achish. But an equivocation which serves the purpose of a lie, is as like to it as a hypocrite is to a profane person, it is only better in appearance, therefore more dangerous. Yet, though believers often manifest imperfections, they can never be prevailed upon to renounce the service of God, and to unite interests with his enemies, or finally to become the servants of sin and Satan. But what a train of evils follow from unbelief! When we forget the Lord's past mercies, and his gracious assurances, we shall be overwhelmed with desponding fears, and probably be led to adopt some dishonourable method to get rid of our troubles. Nothing can so effectually establish us in holy tempers and practices, and preserve us from perplexities, as firm, unshaken dependence upon the promises of God in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
