These "six hundred" had each their households, besides which, many a group of warriors, large and small, had already joined the now renowned standard of the future king.<p><span class= "bld">Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</span>--The same, we believe, as that Achish to whom David fled before (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-11.htm" title="And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?">1Samuel 21:11</a>), and identical with Achish, son of Maachah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.">1Kings 2:39</a>). This would involve the necessity of ascribing a fifty years' reign to this prince. (Such a lengthy reign is quite possible.) The whole of Philistia subsequently fell under King David's rule. It seems, however, that he permitted, even after the conquest, Achish to remain in his old city of Gath, most likely as his tributary: thus, we may suppose, paying back the old debt of kindness to Achish.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Achish, the son of Maoch.</span> No doubt the Achish of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10</a>; but if the same as <span class="cmt_word">Achish, son of Maachah,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>, as is probably the case, he must have lived to a good old age. As it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a> that David conquered the Philistines, and took from them Gath and other towns, it would seem that he still permitted Achish to remain there as a tributary king, while Ziklag he kept as his private property (ver. 6). On the former occasion,. when David was alone, Achish had paid him but scant courtesy; but now that he came with 600 warriors, each <span class="cmt_word">with his household,</span> and, therefore, with numerous followers, he shows him every respect, and for the time David and his men settle at Gath, and Saul gives over his pursuit, knowing that if he followed him into Philistine territory he would provoke a war, for which he was not now prepared. It has been pointed out that David probably introduced from Gath the style of music called Gittith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8, 81, 84</a>, titles). ACHISH ASSIGNS ZIKLAG TO DAVID AS A RESIDENCE (vers. 5-7). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-7 Unbelief is a sin that easily besets even good men, when without are fightings, and within are fears; and it is a hard matter to get over them. Lord, increase our faith! We may blush to think that the word of a Philistine should go further than the word of an Israelite, and that the city of Gath should be a place of refuge for a good man, when the cities of Israel refuse him a safe abode. David gained a comfortable settlement, not only at a distance from Gath, but bordering upon Israel, where he might keep up a correspondence with his own countrymen.</body></html>
