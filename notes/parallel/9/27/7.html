The Hebrew expression, translated "a year," is a singular one: <span class= "ital">yamim</span>--literally, <span class= "ital">days</span>--a collective term, used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-29.htm" title="And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.">Leviticus 25:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm" title="And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.">1Samuel 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-19.htm" title="Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.">1Samuel 2:19</a>, &c., to signify a term or period of days which amounted to a full year. This year and four months were among the darkest days of David's life. He was sorely tried, it is true; but he had adopted the very course his bitterest foes would have wished him to select. In open arms, apparently leagued with the deadliest foes of Israel, like an Italian condottiere or captain of free lances of the Middle Ages, he had taken service and accepted the wages of that very Philistine city whose champion he once had slain in the morning of his career. At last his enemies at the court of Saul had reason when they spoke of him as a traitor. From the curt recital in this chapter, which deals with the saddest portion of David's career, we shall see that while he apparently continued to make common cause with the enemies of his race, he still used his power to help, and not to injure, his countrymen; but the price he paid for his patriotism was a life of falsehood, stained, too, with deeds of fierce cruelty, shocking even in these rough, half-barbarous times.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A full year.</span> Hebrew, "days." Rashi argues in favour of its meaning <span class="accented">some days</span>, and Josephus says the time of David's stay in Philistia was "four months and twenty days;" but already in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-19.htm">1 Samuel 2:19</a>, we have had the phrase "from days day-ward in the sense of <span class="accented">yearly</span>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-2.htm">Judges 19:2</a>, where the A.V. translates the Hebrew <span class="accented">days four months</span> as meaning "four months" only. Probably, as here, it is a year and four months, though the omission of the conjunction is a difficulty. So too for "after a time" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>) it should be "after a year" - Hebrew, <span class="accented">after days.</span> EXPEDITIONS OF DAVID FROM ZIKLAG (vers. 8-12). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-7 Unbelief is a sin that easily besets even good men, when without are fightings, and within are fears; and it is a hard matter to get over them. Lord, increase our faith! We may blush to think that the word of a Philistine should go further than the word of an Israelite, and that the city of Gath should be a place of refuge for a good man, when the cities of Israel refuse him a safe abode. David gained a comfortable settlement, not only at a distance from Gath, but bordering upon Israel, where he might keep up a correspondence with his own countrymen.</body></html>
