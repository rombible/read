Achish trusted that through David's assistance powerful military demonstrations in the southern districts of Saul's kingdom might be made. At this time the Philistine nation were preparing for that grand national effort against Saul which culminated in the battle of Mount Gilboa. David, on the other hand, intended, from a comparatively secure centre of operations somewhere in Philistia, to harry those nomad foes of Israel whose home was in the deserts to the south of Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If l have now found grace in thine eyes.</span> <span class="accented">Now</span> is not an adverb of time, but means "I pray," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> If verily I have found favour with thee. David's position was one of difficulty. The fame of his exploits, and of Saul's vain pursuit of him, made Achish no doubt regard him as a bitter foe of the Israelite king, and expect valuable assistance from him; whereas David was unwilling to take up arms even against Saul, and much less against his own countrymen. He is anxious, therefore, to get away from a too close observation of his acts, and requests Achish to give him <span class="cmt_word">a place in some town in the country.</span> Hebrew, "a place in one of the cities in the field." <span class="cmt_word">Why should thy servant,</span> etc. David's presence with so large a following must in many ways have been inconvenient as well as expensive to Achish. In some small country town David and his men would maintain themselves. Achish accordingly gives him <span class="cmt_word">Ziklag</span>, a small place assigned first of all to Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-31.htm">Joshua 15:31</a>), but subsequently to Simeon (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 19:5). Its exact position is not known. It seems to have been valued by David's successors, as it is noted that it still belonged <span class="cmt_word">unto the kings of Judah.</span> This phrase proves that the Book of Samuel must have been compiled at a date subsequent to the revolt of Jeroboam, while the concluding words, <span class="cmt_word">unto this day,</span> equally plainly indicate a date prior to the Babylonian exile. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-7 Unbelief is a sin that easily besets even good men, when without are fightings, and within are fears; and it is a hard matter to get over them. Lord, increase our faith! We may blush to think that the word of a Philistine should go further than the word of an Israelite, and that the city of Gath should be a place of refuge for a good man, when the cities of Israel refuse him a safe abode. David gained a comfortable settlement, not only at a distance from Gath, but bordering upon Israel, where he might keep up a correspondence with his own countrymen.</body></html>
