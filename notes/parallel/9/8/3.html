(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-6.htm" title="You shall not wrest the judgment of your poor in his cause.">Exodus 23:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm" title="You shall not wrest judgment; you shall not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>.) It is strange that the same ills that ruined Eli's house, owing to the evil conduct of his children, now threatened Samuel. The prophet-judge, however, acted differently to the high priestly judge. The sons of Samuel were evidently, through their father's action in procuring the election of Saul, quickly deposed from their authority. The punishment seems to have been successful in correcting the corrupt tendencies of these men, for we hear in after days of the high position occupied at the court of David by the distinguished descendants of the noble and disinterested prophet. (See the notices in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/25-4.htm" title="Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:">1Chronicles 25:4-5</a>, respecting Heman, the grandson of Samuel, the king's seer, who was chief of the choir of the Psalmist-king in the house of God.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His sons...took bribes.</span> This sin was expressly forbidden in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, and it marks the high spirit of the nation that it was so indignant at justice being thus perverted. <span class="cmt_word">They walked not in his way</span> (singular - so the written text); for Samuel's own administration of justice had been most upright (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-4.htm">1 Samuel 12:4</a>), nor is it laid to his charge that he connived at the misconduct of his sons. On the contrary, after remonstrance indeed, not for his sons' sake, but for the honour of the theocracy, and that the people might be on their guard against a despotic exercise of the power with which they were about to intrust a single man, he superseded not them only, but also himself. His conduct in this trying conjuncture was most admirable, and few commentators have done justice to the man, who, possessed of what was virtually kingly power, yet gave it over for the nation's good into the hands of another. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-3 It does not appear that Samuel's sons were so profane and vicious as Eli's sons; but they were corrupt judges, they turned aside after lucre. Samuel took no bribes, but his sons did, and then they perverted judgment. What added to the grievance of the people was, that they were threatened by an invasion from Nahash, king of the Ammonites.</body></html>
