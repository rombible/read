Take courage, they seem to say, "my old true servant, and be not dismayed at this apparently bitter proof of the ingratitude of the people you loved so well. This deliberate complaint on the part of Israel is directed not against you, the judge, but against Me, the invisible King. They have ever been the same--incapable of becoming my true subjects, and of winning on earth the lofty position I would have given them; you must give them now their hearts' desire. It has all been foreseen and provided for; only make them understand <span class= "ital">what </span>they are asking. Then give them their earthly king." <span class= "ital">Very sad, </span>for it was the deliberate abandonment by the Eternal God of His first intention as regarded Israel--the deliberate lowering of the grand ideal once formed for His chosen people. Here, as is not unfrequent in the Divine records, we have a corner of the veil which hangs between the creature and the Creator lifted for a moment. We see how sadly possible it is for man in the exercise of his perfect freewill to mar the glorious work arranged for him by his God. We see too in the records of such a transaction as this (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm" title="When you are come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>) how all was foreseen by the King of heaven, and we catch sight of the sorrowful regret--if we may use the term--of the Creator for the perverse folly of His creatures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In prayer then the answer came to him that the request of the people must be granted, however wrongly it had been urged. In itself it was wrong; <span class="cmt_word">for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</span> As we saw above, they wanted no theocratic king, whose first duty would be to maintain the Mosaic law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18, 19</a>), and protect the priest and prophet in the discharge of their legitimate functions; all they wanted was a soldier who would put an end to their state of anarchy, and enable them to cultivate their fields without the danger of seeing the produce swept off by marauders. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-9 Samuel was displeased; he could patiently bear what reflected on himself, and his own family; but it displeased him when they said, Give us a king to judge us, because that reflected upon God. It drove him to his knees. When any thing disturbs us, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to show our trouble before God. Samuel is to tell them that they shall have a king. Not that God was pleased with their request, but as sometimes he opposes us from loving-kindness, so at other times he gratifies us in wrath; he did so here. God knows how to bring glory to himself, and serves his own wise purposes, even by men's foolish counsels.</body></html>
