Compelled to receive it until the lords of the Philistines could be convened in council to decide upon its ultimate destination, the plague broke out so heavily among them that they were in utter dismay. For the rendering <span class="cmt_word">deadly destruction</span> is untenable. Literally the words are, "a dismay of death;" but in Hebrew <span class="accented">death</span> added to a word of this sort simply means "very great." So "terrors of death" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-4.htm">Psalm 55:4</a> are very great terrors. In the next verse we learn that many did die, but the words used here describe the mental agony and despair of the people as they saw the ark, which had wrought elsewhere so great misery, brought unto them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-12 The hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Philistines; he not only convinced them of their folly, but severely chastised their insolence. Yet they would not renounce Dagon; and instead of seeking God's mercy, they desired to get clear of his ark. Carnal hearts, when they smart under the judgments of God, would rather, if it were possible, put him far from them, than enter into covenant or communion with him, and seek him for their friend. But their devices to escape the Divine judgments only increase them. Those that fight against God will soon have enough of it.</body></html>
