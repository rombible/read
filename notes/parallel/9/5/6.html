The LXX. has an addition to the Hebrew text here which speaks of a terrible land plague which, apparently from subsequent notices, visited Philistia in addition to the bodily sufferings here spoken of. The Greek Version adds to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm" title="But the hand of the LORD was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.">1Samuel 5:6</a> these words: "and mice were produced in the land, and there arose a great and deadly confusion in the city." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm" title="Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.">1Samuel 6:4</a>, &c, among the expiatory offerings sent by the idolators to Israel to appease what they imagined the offended Hebrew God, "golden mice" are mentioned: "images of the mice that mar the land." The mouse, according to Herodotus and the testimony of hieroglyphics, was an old symbol of pestilence. The Greek translators, however, failing to understand the meaning of the offering of golden mice, added the words--apparently in accordance with a received tradition--by way of explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> his power and might were exercised in smiting them with severe plagues. A question here arises whether, as the Septuagint affirms, besides the scourge of emerods, their land was desolated by swarms of field mice. It is certain that they sent as votive offerings golden images of "the mice that mar the land" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a>); but the translators of the Septuagint too often attempt to make all things easy by unauthorised additions, suggested by the context; and so probably here it was the wish to explain why mice were sent which made them add, "and mice were produced in the land." Really the mouse was a symbol of pestilence (Herod., 2:141), and appears as such in hieroglyphics; and by sending golden mice with golden emerods the lords of the Philistines expressed very clearly that the emerods had been epidemic. This word, more correctly spelt haemorrhoids, has this in its favour, that the noun used here, <span class="accented">ophalim</span>, is never read in the synagogue. Wherever the word occurs the reader was instructed to say <span class="accented">tehorim</span>, the vowels of which are actually attached to the consonants of <span class="accented">ophalim</span> in the text of our Hebrew Bibles. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>. <span class="accented">tehorim</span> is mentioned as one of the loathsome skin diseases of Egypt, and though rendered "emerods" in the A.V., is possibly, as translated by Aquila, "an eating ulcer." <span class="accented">Ophalim</span> need only mean <span class="accented">turnouts, swellings</span>, its original signification being "a hill" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>); yet as the word was not thought fit for public reading in the synagogue, we may feel sure that it means some such tumours as the A.V. describes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-12 The hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Philistines; he not only convinced them of their folly, but severely chastised their insolence. Yet they would not renounce Dagon; and instead of seeking God's mercy, they desired to get clear of his ark. Carnal hearts, when they smart under the judgments of God, would rather, if it were possible, put him far from them, than enter into covenant or communion with him, and seek him for their friend. But their devices to escape the Divine judgments only increase them. Those that fight against God will soon have enough of it.</body></html>
