This was one of the capital cities of the five Philistine princes. It is built on a hill close to the Mediterranean Sea, and was in after days known as Azotus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a>).<p>In Ashdod they placed it in the temple of the popular Philistine god, Dagon. <span class= "ital">This </span>was their vengeance for the slaughter of the 3,000 Philistine worshippers in the temple of the same deity at Gaza, not many years before, by the blind Hebrew champion Samson.<p>The princes and Philistine people well remembered how the blind hero on that awful day, when 3,000 perished in the house of Dagon when he with his superhuman strength forced the great temple pillars down, called on the name of the God of Israel, whom they in their idol-trained hearts associated with the golden Ark.<p>"This only hope relieves me, that the strife<p>With me hath end, all the contest now<p>'Twixt God and Dagon; Dagon hath presumed,<p>Me overthrown, to enter lists with God,<p>His deity comparing and preferring<p>Before the God of Abraham. He, be sure,<p>Will not connive or linger thus provoked,<p>But will arise, and His great name assert."--MILTON.<p>The insulted Dagon and all their murdered countrymen should be avenged by the perpetual humiliation of the "God of Abraham."<p>The sacred Ark should henceforth be placed at the feet of their god Dagon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the Philistines,</span> etc. The words are exactly the same as those in ver. 1, viz. "And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it," marking the simplicity of ancient narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Dagon</span> is derived by Philo from <span class="accented">dagan</span>, "corn," and is explained by him as an emblem of the earth's fertility; but as the shape of this national deity of the Philistines was certainly that of a man to the waist, ending in the body and tail of a fish, the true derivation is doubtless that from <span class="accented">dag</span>, "a fish." It represented, however, not so much the sea, on which the Philistines trafficked, as the fruitfulness of water, which in the East is looked upon as the active principle of life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20</a>). In one of the sculptures brought from Khorsabad there is a representation of a battle between the Assyrians and the inhabitants of the Syrian sea coast, and in it there is a figure, the upper part of which is a bearded man with a crown, while from the waist downwards it has the shape of a fish (Layard's 'Nineveh,' 2:466). Moreover, it is swimming in the sea, and is surrounded by a multitude of marine creatures. Doubtless this figure represents Dagon, who, nevertheless, is not to be regarded as a sea god, like Neptune; but as the fish is the product of water, he is the symbol of nature's reproductive energy. Together with Dagon a female deity was commonly worshipped, called Atergatis, half woman and half fish, whose temple is mentioned in 2 Macc. 12:26. In the margin there she is explained as being <span class="accented">Venus</span>; but the ideas have only this in common - that Venus also, as rising out of the sea, symbolises life as springing out of water. As Dagon had a temple also at Gaza (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a>), and at the other cities of Philistia (Jerome on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), he was evidently the chief deity of the nation, and the solemn depositing of the ark in his temple, and <span class="cmt_word">by Dagon,</span> - literally, "at his side," - was intended as a public demonstration that the God of the Israelites was inferior to, and had been vanquished by, the national deity of the Philistines. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 See the ark's triumph over Dagon. Thus the kingdom of Satan will certainly fall before the kingdom of Christ, error before truth, profaneness before godliness, and corruption before grace in the hearts of the faithful. When the interests of religion seem to be ready to sink, even then we may be confident that the day of their triumph will come. When Christ, the true Ark of the covenant, really enters the heart of fallen man, which is indeed Satan's temple, all idols will fall, every endeavour to set them up again will be vain, sin will be forsaken, and unrighteous gain restored; the Lord will claim and possess the throne. But pride, self-love, and worldly lusts, though dethroned and crucified, still remain within us, like the stump of Dagon. Let us watch and pray that they may not prevail. Let us seek to have them more entirely destroyed.</body></html>
