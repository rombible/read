hence, no doubt, the worship of Dagon, the fish-god. It seems to have been something more than mere "Nature worship," the devotion of the Ph?nician settlers on the sea-board of Syria and Canaan to a marine deity. The constitution of Philistia was oligarchical: that is, the government was in the hands of a College of Princes, whose decision no individual could oppose. The princes (<span class= "ital">seranim</span>) are the heads of the several city districts, which formed a confederation, each one of the five chief cities holding a number of places, country cities, or "daughter" cities, as its special district. (See Erdmann in <span class= "ital">Lange's Commentary.</span>) Dr. Payne Smith (Dean of Canterbury) has an ingenious and scholarly derivation for the titular designation of these lords (Hebrew, <span class= "ital">seranim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>in which, rejecting the usual root <span class= "ital">sar, </span>a prince, he connects the word with <span class= "ital">seren,</span> a hinge; "just," he says, "as the cardinals of the Church of Rome take their name from <span class= "ital">cardo, </span>which has the same meaning."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lords of the Philistines.</span> Philistia was governed by a council of five princes, but whether they were elective or hereditary in the several towns is by no means clear. They are called "seranim," from <span class="accented">seren</span>, "a hinge," just as the cardinals of the Church of Rome take their name from the Latin word <span class="accented">cardo</span>, which has the same meaning. There is no ground for connecting the word with <span class="accented">sar</span>, "a prince." When Ewald did so he probably forgot that the two words begin with different letters - seren with <span class="accented">samech</span>, and sar with <span class="accented">shin.</span> Seranim is the word constantly used of the lords of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5, 8</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-9.htm">1 Chronicles 12:9</a>), though after being correctly so styled in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2</a>, they are popularly called in vers. 3, 4, 9, <span class="accented">sarim</span>, "princes." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.</span> Unwilling to part with so signal a proof of their victory, the lords of the Philistines determine to remove the ark to another locality, but thereby only made the miraculous nature of what was taking place more evident to all. Of Gath but little is known; but Jerome describes it as still a large village in his days, and as situated near the border of Judaea, on the road from Eleutheropolis to Gaza. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-12 The hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Philistines; he not only convinced them of their folly, but severely chastised their insolence. Yet they would not renounce Dagon; and instead of seeking God's mercy, they desired to get clear of his ark. Carnal hearts, when they smart under the judgments of God, would rather, if it were possible, put him far from them, than enter into covenant or communion with him, and seek him for their friend. But their devices to escape the Divine judgments only increase them. Those that fight against God will soon have enough of it.</body></html>
