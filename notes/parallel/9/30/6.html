and now, finding that David had neglected to provide against the Amalekite raid, their pent-up fury thus displayed itself. Then David, we shall see, threw himself, with all his old perfect trustfulness, upon the mercy of his God.<p><span class= "bld">But David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</span>--He encouraged himself in prayer, thus casting himself and his fortunes on the God who, years before, had chosen him to be "His anointed." It was this <span class= "ital">trust, </span>as we have before seen in his own case, in the case, too, of Jonathan, as it had been in old days with all the heroes of Israel--this perfect, childlike, implicit trust in the "Glorious Arm"--which had been the source of the marvellous success of the chosen people. When they forgot the invisible King, who for His own great purposes had chosen them, their fortunes at once declined; they fell to the level, and often below the level, of the surrounding nations. We have many conspicuous examples of this; for instance, in the lives of Samson and Saul, how, when with weeping and with mourning, they returned to their allegiance, and again leaned on the "Arm," success and victory returned to them. This is what happened now to David at Ziklag, while about the same time Saul, alone and distrustful, fought and fell on the bloody day of Gilboa. David, with the help of his God, on whose mercy he had thrown himself, obtained his brilliant success over Amalek, and restored his prestige not only among his own immediate followers, but through all the cities and villages of Southern Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The soul of all the people was grieved.</span> Hebrew, "was bitter." Their great sorrow is pathetically described in ver. 4. But, as is often the case with those in distress, from grief they turned to anger, and sought relief for their feelings by venting their rage upon the innocent. Possibly David had not taken precautions against a danger which he had not apprehended; but, left almost friendless in the angry crowd who were calling out to stone him, <span class="cmt_word">he encouraged himself in Jehovah, his God.</span> Literally, "strengthened himself in Jehovah, and summoned the priest to ask counsel and guidance of God by the ephod. DAVID'S PURSUIT OF THE AMALEKITES (vers. 7-16). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-6 When we go abroad in the way of our duty, we may comfortably hope that God will take care of our families in our absence, but not otherwise. If, when we come off a journey, we find our abode in peace, and not laid waste, as David here found his, let the Lord be praised for it. David's men murmured against him. Great faith must expect such severe trials. But, observe, that David was brought thus low, only just before he was raised to the throne. When things are at the worst with the church and people of God, then they begin to mend. David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. His men fretted at their loss, the soul of the people was bitter; their own discontent and impatience added to the affliction and misery. But David bore it better, though he had more reason than any of them to lament it. They gave liberty to their passions, but he set his graces to work; and while they dispirited each other, he, by encouraging himself in God, kept his spirit calm. Those who have taken the Lord for their God, may take encouragement from him in the worst times.</body></html>
