the literal reading is, "And David took all the flocks and the herds; they drove them before their cattle, and said, this is David's spoil." David took, no doubt, by popular acclamation as <span class= "ital">his </span>share of the plunder, all the flocks and herds belonging to the Amalekites, mostly acquired, no doubt, in the late raid; these were driven in front of "those cattle" thus particularising <span class= "ital">the cattle of Ziklag </span>belonging to David's own people. Of course, this plunder went back to the original Israelitish owners. The drovers, as they marched behind the vast herds of Amalekite cattle, sung of the prowess of their leader in words long remembered, "See all this. This is David's spoil." It was "these herds"--numerically, probably very great--that David distributed among the friendly cities of the south. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1Samuel 30:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-31.htm" title="And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.">1Samuel 30:31</a>.) All the other plunder of the camp--arms, accoutrements, ornaments, jewels, camels' cloths, &c.--was divided, as Bishop Hervey well suggests, among the little army. David's motive in choosing the sheep and oxen (for his warriors certainly the least desirable part of the Amalekite possession) is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1Samuel 30:26-31</a>. They were the most acceptable presents he could make to his friends in Judah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - This verse, which is made unintelligible in the A.V. by the insertion of the unauthorised word <span class="accented">which</span>, is really free from difficulty. After David, as related in vers. 18, 19, had recovered the cattle carried oft by the Amalekites, he also took all the flocks and herds belonging to them; and his own men "made these go in front of that body of cattle, and said, This is David's spoil," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they presented it to him by acclamation. It was this large booty which he distributed among his friends (vers. 26-31).

Nor does any thing give our spiritual enemies more advantage than sensuality and indulgence. Eating and drinking, and dancing, have been the soft and pleasant way in which many have gone down to the congregation of the dead. The spoil was recovered, and brought off; nothing was lost, but a great deal gained.</body></html>
