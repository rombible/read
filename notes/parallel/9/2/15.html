A contemptuous insult was here offered to the Lord. This fat was not to be eaten or taken by any one; it was God's portion, to be burnt by the priest on the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-16.htm" title="And the priest shall burn them on the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet smell: all the fat is the LORD's.">Leviticus 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-23.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, You shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.">Leviticus 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-25.htm" title="For whoever eats the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-30.htm" title="His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.">Leviticus 7:30-31</a>).<p>In all these strange rites and ceremonies there was a higher symbolism involved. This was ruthlessly set at nought and trampled on by these reckless, covetous guardians of the worship of Israel.<p>Portions of the sacrifice fell legally to the ministering priests in lieu of fee. It was fair "that they which ministered at the altar should live of the altar." The "heave leg" and the "wave breast" of the slaughtered victim were theirs by right, and these the sacrificing priest was to receive <span class= "ital">after </span>the fat portion of the sacrifice had been burnt upon the altar. But to take the flesh of the victim, and roast it before the symbolic offering had been made, was a crime which was equivalent to robbing God. It dishonoured the whole ceremony.<p><span class= "bld">He will not have sodden flesh.</span>--The meaning of this is, these priests and their attendants insisted on having the best part of the sacrificed victim <span class= "ital">raw, </span>not boiled--that is, fresh, full of juice and strength--before the offering had been made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-26 Samuel, being devoted to the Lord in a special manner, was from a child employed about the sanctuary in the services he was capable of. As he did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break through restraints.</body></html>
