The words, however, point to something which Eli would live to see with grief and horror. The reference is no doubt to the capture of the Ark by the Philistines in the battle where his sons were slain. The earthly habitation of the Eternal was there robbed of its glory and pride, for the ark of the covenant was the heart of the sanctuary.<p><span class= "bld">In all the wealth which God shall give Israel.</span>--"The affliction of God's house from the loss of the ark remained while under the lead of Samuel there came blessing to the people."--<span class= "ital">Erdmann.</span><p>There is another explanation which refers the fulfilment of this part of the prophecy to the period of Solomon's reign, when Abiathar, of the house of Eli, was deposed from the High Priestly dignity to make room for Zadok, but the reference to the capture of the ark is by far more probable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt see an enemy.</span> The translation of ver. 32 is very difficult, but is probably as follows: "And thou shalt behold, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> see with wonder and astonishment, narrowness of habitation in all the wealth which shall be given unto Israel." The word translated <span class="accented">narrowness</span> often means an "enemy," but as that for <span class="accented">habitation</span> is the most general term in the Hebrews language for a dwelling, being used even of the dens of wild beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>), the rendering an "enemy of dwelling" gives no sense. Hence the violent insertion of the pronoun <span class="accented">my</span>, for which no valid excuse can be given. But <span class="accented">narrowness of dwelling</span>, means distress, especially in a man's domestic relations, and this is the sense required. In the growing public and national prosperity which was to be Israel's lot under Samuel, Saul, David, and Solomon, Eli was to see, not in person, but prophetically, calamity attaching itself to his own family. His house was to decay in the midst of the progress of all the rest. Upon this denunciation of private distress naturally follows the repetition of the threat that the house of Ithamar should be left without an old man to guide its course onward to renewed prosperity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:27-36 Those who allow their children in any evil way, and do not use their authority to restrain and punish them, in effect honour them more than God. Let Eli's example excite parents earnestly to strive against the beginnings of wickedness, and to train up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. In the midst of the sentence against the house of Eli, mercy is promised to Israel. God's work shall never fall to the ground for want of hands to carry it on. Christ is that merciful and faithful High Priest, whom God raised up when the Levitical priesthood was thrown off, who in all things did his Father's mind, and for whom God will build a sure house, build it on a rock, so that hell cannot prevail against it.</body></html>
