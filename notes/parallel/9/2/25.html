There are transgressions which may again and again receive pardon, but there seems to be a transgression beyond the limits of Divine forgiveness.

The Lord's resolution to slay them was founded on the eternal foreknowledge of their persistence in wrong-doing.<p>There seems to be a period in the sinner's life when the Spirit of the Eternal ceases to plead; then the man is left to himself, and he feels no longer any remorse for evil done; this is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, When you go to return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.">Exodus 4:21</a> as "hardening the heart." This period in the life of Hophni and Phinehas apparently had been reached when the Lord resolved to slay them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-26 Samuel, being devoted to the Lord in a special manner, was from a child employed about the sanctuary in the services he was capable of. As he did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break through restraints.</body></html>
