Not improbably the old man, too, well aware of the character of his own sons, hoped to train up the favoured child--whose connection with himself and the sanctuary had begun in so remarkable a manner--as his successor in the chief sacred and civil office in Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His mother made him a little coat.</span> The coat, <span class="accented">meil</span>, was worn by priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7</a>), by kings and their sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>), by prophets (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 28:14), and even by women (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>). It was an under garment of wool, woven throughout without seam, with holes for the head and arms, and reaching nearly to the ground: when used by women it had sleeves (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). Under it they had a tunic or shirt fitting so closely that a man simply so clad was considered naked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), and over it priests and Levites wore the ephod, and so also David on the occasion mentioned above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm">1 Chronicles 15:27</a>). The <span class="accented">meil</span> seems, moreover, to have often been a handsome dress, as that of the priests was of purple blue, with embroidery of pomegranates in three colours, and golden bells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31-34</a>); and when made of delicate materials for the use of the rich, it and the tunic are the soft luxurious clothing spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-8.htm">Matthew 11:8</a>. As the meal was the ordinary dress of all classes of people, it was made for Samuel at home, and can have no special meaning; but the ephod shows that he was brought up in the daffy practice of holy duties. This annual present, however, of clothing made by the mother's hands proves that the dedication of her son to God was not allowed to interfere with home affections, and both parents and child must have looked forward with joy to happy meetings at each recurrence of the family visit to the sanctuary. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-26 Samuel, being devoted to the Lord in a special manner, was from a child employed about the sanctuary in the services he was capable of. As he did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break through restraints.</body></html>
