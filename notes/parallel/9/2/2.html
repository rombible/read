The image, doubtless, is a memory of the long desert wandering. The steep precipices and the strange fantastic rocks of Sinai, standing up in the midst of the shifting desert sands, supplied an ever present picture of unchangeableness, of majesty, and of security. The term rock, as applied to God, is first found in the Song of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm" title="Of the Rock that begat you you are unmindful, and have forgotten God that formed you.">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-30.htm" title="How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?">Deuteronomy 32:30-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-37.htm" title="And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>), where the juxtaposition of rock and salvation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-15.htm" title="Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw.">1Samuel 2:15</a>--<span class= "ital">he lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation</span>--seems to indicate that Hannah was acquainted with this song or national hymn of Moses. The same phrase is frequent in the Psalms.<p>That the term was commonly applied to God so early as the time of Moses we may conclude from the name Zurishaddai: "My rock is the Almighty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-6.htm" title="Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.">Numbers 1:6</a>); and Zuriel: "My rock is God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-35.htm" title="And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward.">Numbers 3:35</a>).--<span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Hannah's heart rejoiced, not in Samuel, but in the Lord. She looks beyond the gift, and praises the Giver. She rejoiced in the salvation of the Lord, and in expectation of His coming, who is the whole salvation of his people. The strong are soon weakened, and the weak are soon strengthened, when God pleases. Are we poor? God made us poor, which is a good reason why we should be content, and make up our minds to our condition. Are we rich? God made us rich, which is a good reason why we should be thankful, and serve him cheerfully, and do good with the abundance he gives us. He respects not man's wisdom or fancied excellences, but chooses those whom the world accounts foolish, teaching them to feel their guilt, and to value his free and precious salvation. This prophecy looks to the kingdom of Christ, that kingdom of grace, of which Hannah speaks, after having spoken largely of the kingdom of providence. And here is the first time that we meet with the name MESSIAH, or his Anointed. The subjects of Christ's kingdom will be safe, and the enemies of it will be ruined; for the Anointed, the Lord Christ, is able to save, and to destroy.</body></html>
