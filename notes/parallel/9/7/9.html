The lamb was at least seven days old, for so the law required (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-27.htm">Leviticus 22:27</a>), but probably not much older; for the word, a rare one, occurring elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>, means something small and tender: this then <span class="cmt_word">he offered for a burnt offering wholly unto Jehovah.</span> The A.V. translates in this way because <span class="accented">chalil</span>, "whole," is masculine, while <span class="accented">olah</span>, "a burnt offering," is feminine; but <span class="accented">chalil</span> had in course of time come to be used as a substantive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-23.htm">Leviticus 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-16.htm">Deuteronomy 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>), and is really here in opposition to <span class="accented">olah</span>, and so the two together signify "a whole burnt offering," and clearly indicate that the lamb was entirely consumed by fire. <span class="accented">Olah</span> means <span class="accented">that which ascends</span>, and symbolised devotion and consecration to God. <span class="accented">Chalil</span> intensified this signification, and showed that all was God's, and no part whatsoever reserved for the priest or the offerer. And thus then Samuel's burnt offering implied that the people gave themselves unreservedly to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehovah heard him</span>. Really, "Jehovah answered him," by the thunder mentioned in ver. 10. For thunder was regarded as God's voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>. we have a poetic description of its majesty and power. Express mention is also made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a> of Jehovah having thus answered the prayers of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>), and of Samuel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:7-12 The Philistines invaded Israel. When sinners begin to repent and reform, they must expect that Satan will muster all his force against them, and set his instruments at work to the utmost, to oppose and discourage them. The Israelites earnestly beg Samuel to pray for them. Oh what a comfort it is to all believers, that our great Intercessor above never ceases, is never silent! for he always appears in the presence of God for us. Samuel's sacrifice, without his prayer, had been an empty shadow. God gave a gracious answer. And Samuel erected a memorial of this victory, to the glory of God, and to encourage Israel. Through successive generations, the church of God has had cause to set up Eben-ezers for renewed deliverances; neither outward persecutions nor inward corruptions have prevailed against her, because hitherto the Lord hath helped her: and he will help, even to the end of the world.</body></html>
