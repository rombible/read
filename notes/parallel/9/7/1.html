It was neither a priestly nor a Levitical city, but it no doubt had preserved something of its ancient character of sanctity even among the children of Israel. In old days before the Hebrew invasion, it was a notable "high place," and a seat of worship of Baal. This was also, no doubt, taken into account when it was resolved to locate the Ark there. The words "in the hill" remind us that the old "high place" was still marked, and was from its sacred associations looked on as a fitting temporary resting-place for the sacred treasure of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Eleazar</span>--It is most likely that this Abinadab was a Levite. The names Eleazar and Uzzah, and Ahio of the same family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm" title="And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.">2Samuel 6:3</a>), are Levitical appellations. Samuel--who, though he is not named in this transaction, was, no doubt, the director--would, of course, have endeavoured to find a man of the tribe of Levi for the sacred trust. "This Eleazar was constituted not priest, but watchman at the grave of the Ark by its corpse, till the future joyful resurrection."--<span class= "ital">Hengstenberg, </span>quoted in <span class= "ital">Lange. </span>Here the Ark remained until King David brought it from "the house on the hill," in the city of woods, first to the home of Obed-edom, and then to his own royal Zion. (2 Samuel 6. See too <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-6.htm" title="See, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.">Psalm 132:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - At Kirjath-jearim the people reverently undertook the charge of the ark, and carried out their arrangements so carefully that no further calamity occurred. On its arrival they placed it in <span class="cmt_word">the house of Abinadab in the hill.</span> More probably <span class="accented">at Gibeah</span>, as it is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3, 4</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-57.htm">Joshua 15:57</a> a village of this name is mentioned in the tribe of Judah not far from Kirjath-jearim (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 60), and probably Abinadab, who lived there, was a Levite, and so his house was chosen, and his son Eleazar <span class="cmt_word">sanctified to keep the ark.</span> The names of both father and son are common in the Levitical genealogies, and none but a member of this tribe would have been selected for so holy a duty. If, however, the translation <span class="accented">in the hill</span> be preferred, we may suppose that it was because lofty heights were still considered fit places for Jehovah's worship, or there may even have been a "high place" there, of which Abinadab was the keeper. What exactly were the duties of Eleazar we cannot tell, as the word <span class="accented">to keep</span> is very indefinite; but probably, after the fearful ruin at Shiloh, all regular services and sacrifices were in abeyance until the return of happier times. Even here it was the men of the city who sanctified Eleazar, and not a priest. THE REFORMATION OF ISRAEL (vers. 2-6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-4 God will find a resting-place for his ark; if some thrust it from them, the hearts of others shall be inclined to receive it. It is no new thing for God's ark to be in a private house. Christ and his apostles preached from house to house, when they could not have public places. Twenty years passed before the house of Israel cared for the want of the ark. During this time the prophet Samuel laboured to revive true religion. The few words used are very expressive; and this was one of the most effectual revivals of religion which ever took place in Israel.</body></html>
