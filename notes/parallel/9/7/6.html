but the tribes were scattered, their fortresses in the hand of enemies, there was scarcely any national life in that gloomy period in the people. In the first general assembly of the tribes the rank and position which Samuel had long really filled are publicly acknowledged.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They... drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah.</span> While the drawing of water was a joyful act (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37, 38</a>), as symbolising the winning from the depths below of the source of life and health, the pouring it out before Jehovah expressed sorrow for sin, and so it is explained by the Chaldee Paraphrast: "They poured out their heart in penitence like water before the Lord" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>). It might here also signify weakness and powerlessness, the being "as water spilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered up again" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>). They further expressed their sorrow by fasting, enjoined "for the afflicting of their souls" upon the great day of atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>). And to these symbolical acts they joined the confession of the mouth, acknowledging that "they had sinned against Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.</span> That is, he now became the acknowledged ruler of Israel in things temporal, both civil and military., as he had previously been in things spiritual by virtue of his office as prophet. This was, of course, the result of the decisive action he had taken in summoning this national convention; but the words strongly suggest that there was some direct appointment, or at the very least a national acknowledgment of Samuel's authority, especially as they precede the history of the defeat of the Philistines. He had summoned the people together as Nabi, prophet, and when he said, "I will pray for you unto Jehovah," there was the implied meaning that he would be with them only in that capacity. But when the time came to appoint a general, who would act under him as Barak had acted under Deborah, the great chiefs, probably, who saw in him the prime mover of all that was being done, urged him also to take the command,and upon his consent he became also Shophet or judge.

They pour out their hearts in repentance before the Lord. They were free and full in their confession, and fixed in their resolution to cast away from them all their wrong doings. They made a public confession, We have sinned against the Lord; thus giving glory to God, and taking shame to themselves. And if we thus confess our sins, we shall find our God faithful and just to forgive us our sins.</body></html>
