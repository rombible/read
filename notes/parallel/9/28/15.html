Keil, however, rightly concludes that these words by themselves do not decide the question as to <span class= "ital">what </span>power called up the "spirit." They simply assert that Samuel had been disturbed from his rest by Saul, and ask the reason why. In the Babylonian Talmud there is a remarkable comment on these words of the shade of the departed prophet. "Rabbi Elazar said, when he read this Scripture text, 'Why hast thou disquieted me?' If Samuel the righteous was afraid of the Judgment (to which he thought he was summoned when thus called up), how much more ought we to be afraid of the Judgment? And whence do we infer that Samuel was afraid? Because it is written, 'And the woman said unto Saul, I saw mighty ones [or perhaps judges]--Elohim--ascending out of the earth: <span class= "ital">olim, </span>ascending (a <span class= "ital">plural </span>form), implies at least two, and one of them was Samuel; <span class= "ital">who, </span>then, was the other? Samuel went and brought Moses with him, and said unto him, 'Peradventure I am summoned to Judgment-God forbid! O stand thou by me; lo! there is not a thing which is written in thy Law that I have not fulfilled."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Chaggigah, </span>fol. 4, <span class= "ital">b.</span><p><span class= "bld">I am sore distressed.</span>--"O, the wild wail of this dark misery! There is a deep pathos and a weird awesomeness in this despairing cry, but there is no confession of sin, no beseeching for mercy--nothing but the overmastering ambition to preserve himself."--<span class= "ital">Dr. W. M. Taylor, </span>of New York: "David."<p>For the gallant warrior Saul thus to despair was indeed strange, but his gloomy foreboding before the fatal field of Gilboa, where he was to lose his crown and life, were sadly verified by the sequel. Shakespeare thus describes <span class= "ital">Richard III. </span>heavy and spiritless, with an unknown dread, before the fatal Bosworth field:--<p>"I have not that alacrity of spirit<p>Nor cheer of mind that I was went to have."<p><span class= "ital">King Richard III.</span><p>So <span class= "ital">Macbeth </span>is full of a restless, shapeless terror at Dunsinane before the battle:--<p>"There is no flying hence, no tarrying here;<p>I 'gin to be aweary of the sun."--<span class= "ital">Macbeth.</span><p><span class= "bld">Neither by prophets, nor by dreams.</span>--Why does Saul omit to mention here the silence of the "Urim," especially mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-6.htm" title="Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.">1Samuel 27:6</a>, and which seems also in these days to have been the more usual way of enquiry after the will of the Eternal King; of Israel? The Talmud, treatise <span class= "ital">Berachoth, </span>xii. 2, gives the probable answer. Saul knew the Urim was no longer in his kingdom. It had been worn by one whom he had foully murdered--Ahimelech, the high priest. Deep shame at the thought of the massacre of Ahimelech, and afterwards of the priests at Nob, stayed him from uttering the word "Urim" before Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore I have called thee.</span>--The Hebrew word here is a very unusual form, which apparently was used to strengthen the original idea, "I have had thee called "; in other words, "Hence this pressing urgent call to thee from thy rest."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why hast thou disquieted me?</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> Why hast thou caused me to be disturbed by the incantations of this woman? <span class="cmt_word">Neither by prophets nor by dreams.</span> It is suggested in the Talmud (Berach 12:2) that Saul omitted all mention of the Urim from shame at having murdered the priests. <span class="cmt_word">Is become thine enemy.</span> By a slight difference of reading the Septuagint have, "is on the side of thy neighbour." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:7-19 When we go from the plain path of duty, every thing draws us further aside, and increases our perplexity and temptation. Saul desires the woman to bring one from the dead, with whom he wished to speak; this was expressly forbidden, De 18:11. All real or pretended witchcraft or conjuration, is a malicious or an ignorant attempt to gain knowledge or help from some creature, when it cannot be had from the Lord in the path of duty. While Samuel was living, we never read of Saul's going to advise with him in any difficulties; it had been well for him if he had. But now he is dead, Bring me up Samuel. Many who despise and persecute God's saints and ministers when living, would be glad to have them again, when they are gone. The whole shows that it was no human fraud or trick. Though the woman could not cause Samuel's being sent, yet Saul's inquiry might be the occasion of it. The woman's surprise and terror proved that it was an unusual and unexpected appearance. Saul had despised Samuel's solemn warnings in his lifetime, yet now that he hoped, as in defiance of God, to obtain some counsel and encouragement from him, might not God permit the soul of his departed prophet to appear to Saul, to confirm his former sentence, and denounce his doom? The expression, Thou and thy sons shall be with me, means no more than that they shall be in the eternal world. There appears much solemnity in God's permitting the soul of a departed prophet to come as a witness from heaven, to confirm the word he had spoken on earth.</body></html>
