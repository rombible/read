"Those that had familiar spirits"--those that had at their command <span class= "ital">oboth, </span>rendered "familiar spirits," the plural form of <span class= "ital">ob, </span>a word which has never been explained with any certainty. Scholars think they can connect it with <span class= "ital">ob, to be hollow, </span>and <span class= "ital">ob </span>is then "the hollow thing," or "bag;" and so it came to signify, "one who speaks in a hollow voice." It hence appears to mean the distended belly of the <span class= "ital">ventriloquist, </span>a word by which the LXX. always render <span class= "ital">ob. </span>It thus is used to designate the male or female ventriloquist, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-3.htm" title="And David dwelled with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.">1Samuel 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-9.htm" title="And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.">1Samuel 27:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-11.htm" title="Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>, &c., and also the spirit which was supposed to speak from the belly of the ventriloquist; in this sense it is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/27-8.htm" title="And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 27:8-9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a>. This is the explanation given by Erdmann in <span class= "ital">Lange, </span>and the Bishop of Bath and Wells in the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary.</span><p><span class= "bld">The wizards.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the wise people. </span>These are ever connected with the <span class= "ital">oboth, </span>"those that had familiar spirits." The name seems to have been given in irony to these dealers in occult and forbidden arts. The Mosaic command respecting these people was clear and decisive: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch.(or wizard) to live" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm" title="You shall not suffer a witch to live.">Exodus 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm" title="A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:27</a>). Saul, in his early zeal, we read, had actively put in force these edicts of Moses, which apparently, in the lax state of things which had long prevailed in Israel, had been suffered to lie in abeyance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Samuel was dead.</span> A repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1</a>, inserted to explain Saul's conduct, as is the other fact, that <span class="cmt_word">Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits,</span> etc. We are not told when Saul did this; but at the commencement of his reign, when he brought the ark to Nob, he was probably earnest generally in his observance of the precepts of the Mosaic law. <span class="cmt_word">Familiar spirits.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">oboth</span>, the plural of <span class="accented">ob</span>, a leathern bottle. It is generally taken to refer to the distended belly of the conjurer, into which the summoned spirit of the dead was supposed to enter, and thence speak; for which reason the Septuagint renders the word" ventriloquist," and is followed by most modern commentators. <span class="cmt_word">Wizards</span>. Hebrew, "knowing ones," from the verb <span class="accented">to know</span>; just as <span class="accented">wizard</span> comes from the old verb <span class="accented">to wiss.</span> With ignorant people unusual knowledge is always looked upon with suspicion; but these supposed magicians professed a knowledge to which they bad no claim. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-6 David could not refuse Achish without danger. If he promised assistance, and then stood neuter, or went over to the Israelites, he would behave with ingratitude and treachery. If he fought against Israel, he would sin greatly. It seemed impossible that he should get out of this difficulty with a clear conscience; but his evasive answer, intended to gain time, was not consistent with the character of an Israelite indeed. Troubles are terrors to the children of disobedience. In his distress, Saul inquired of the Lord. He did not seek in faith, but with a double, unstable mind. Saul had put the law in force against those that had familiar spirits, Ex 22:18. Many seem zealous against, sin, when they are any way hurt by it, who have no concern for the glory of God, nor any dislike of sin as sin. Many seem enemies to sin in others, while they indulge it in themselves. Saul will drive the devil out of his kingdom, yet harbours him in his heart by envy and malice. How foolish to consult those whom, according to God's law, he had endeavoured to root out!</body></html>
