(<span class= "ital">a</span>) The utter defeat of the army of Israel. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) The violent death of Saul himself and his two sons in the course of the impending fight. (c) The sacking of the Israelitish camp, which was to follow the defeat, and which would terribly augment the horrors and disasters of the rout of the king's army.<p>"This overthrow of the people was to heighten Saul's misery, when he saw the people plunged with him into ruin through his sin."--<span class= "ital">O. von Gerlach.</span><p><span class= "bld">To morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me.</span>--The Hebrew word here rendered "to morrow," <span class= "ital">machar, </span>need not signify "the next day," but some near future time. In saying "thou shalt be with me," Samuel does not pronounce Saul's final condemnation, for he had no mission to do so, but rather draws him by his tenderness to a better mind. He uses a mild and charitable expression, applicable to all, good and bad, "Thou shalt be as I am: no longer among the living." In the vision of the world of spirits, revealed to us by our blessed Lord, the souls of Dives and Lazarus may be said to be together in the abode of the departed spirits, for Dives saw Lazarus, and conversed with Abraham, though there was a gulf fixed between them. "If Samuel had said to Saul, 'Thou shalt be among the damned,' he would have crushed him with a weight of despair, and have hardened him in his impenitence; but by using this gentler expression, he mildly exhorted him to repentance. While there was life there was hope: the door was still open."--<span class= "ital">Bishop Wordsworth.</span><p>"Shalt thou be with me" does not refer to an equality in bliss, but to a like condition of death.--<span class= "ital">St. Augustine. </span>Augustine here means that to-morrow Saul would be "a shade," like to what Samuel then was; he says, however, nothing respecting Saul's enjoying bliss like that which he (Samuel) was doubtless then enjoying.<p><span class= "bld">The host.</span>--"Host" here should be rendered <span class= "ital">camp. </span>The meaning, then, of the whole verse would be: first, there would be a total defeat of the royal army; secondly, Saul and his sons would fall; thirdly, the rout would be followed by the sack of the camp of Israel, and its attendant horrors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:7-19 When we go from the plain path of duty, every thing draws us further aside, and increases our perplexity and temptation. Saul desires the woman to bring one from the dead, with whom he wished to speak; this was expressly forbidden, De 18:11. All real or pretended witchcraft or conjuration, is a malicious or an ignorant attempt to gain knowledge or help from some creature, when it cannot be had from the Lord in the path of duty. While Samuel was living, we never read of Saul's going to advise with him in any difficulties; it had been well for him if he had. But now he is dead, Bring me up Samuel. Many who despise and persecute God's saints and ministers when living, would be glad to have them again, when they are gone. The whole shows that it was no human fraud or trick. Though the woman could not cause Samuel's being sent, yet Saul's inquiry might be the occasion of it. The woman's surprise and terror proved that it was an unusual and unexpected appearance. Saul had despised Samuel's solemn warnings in his lifetime, yet now that he hoped, as in defiance of God, to obtain some counsel and encouragement from him, might not God permit the soul of his departed prophet to appear to Saul, to confirm his former sentence, and denounce his doom? The expression, Thou and thy sons shall be with me, means no more than that they shall be in the eternal world. There appears much solemnity in God's permitting the soul of a departed prophet to come as a witness from heaven, to confirm the word he had spoken on earth.</body></html>
