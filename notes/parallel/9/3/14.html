A great theological truth is contained in these few words. in the sacrificial theory of the Mosaic Law we see there was a <span class= "ital">limit </span>to the efficacy of sacrifice after a certain point in sin and evil example had been reached: a scar was printed on the life which no blood of bullock or of goat could wash away; but the quiet, though sorrowful, resignation with which the old man received the intimation of the certain earthly doom seems to indicate that Eli, sure of the love of the All-Pitiful, looked on to some other means of deliverance, devised in the counsels of the Eternal Friend of Israel, by which his deathless soul, after the earthly penalty, would be reconciled to the invisible King. Did not men like Eli look on in sure and certain trust to the <span class= "ital">one hope? </span>Did not these holy, though often erring, patriarchs and priests see in those far-back days, "as in a glass darkly," the blood of another Victim, which should cleanse the repentant and sorrowing sinner from all sin?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sacrifice nor offering.</span> The first of these is <span class="accented">zebach</span>, the sacrifice of an animal by the shedding of its blood; the second is the <span class="accented">minchah</span>, or unbloody sacrifice. The guilt of Eli's sons could be <span class="cmt_word">purged</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> expiated, by none of the appointed offerings for sin, because they had hardened themselves in their wrong doing even after the solemn warning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>. Hence the marked repetition of the denunciation of finality in their doom. Again it is said that it is <span class="cmt_word">forever</span>. It has, however, been well noticed that though the message of Samuel confirms all that had been threatened by the man of God, yet that no bitter or painful words are put into the mouth of one who was still a child. For this there may also be a further reason. The first message was intended to give Eli and his sons a final opportunity of repentance, and, that it might produce its full effect, the severity of the doom impending upon them was clearly set before their eyes. They did not repent. Eli hardened himself in his weakness, and took no steps to vindicate God's service from the slur cast upon it by an unworthy priesthood. His sons hardened themselves in crime, and made their office a reproach. It was enough, therefore, to repeat and confirm generally the terms of the former prophecy, as no moral object would be gained by calling attention to the severity of the coming judgment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-18 What a great deal of guilt and corruption is there in us, concerning which we may say, It is the iniquity which our own heart knoweth; we are conscious to ourselves of it! Those who do not restrain the sins of others, when it is in their power to do it, make themselves partakers of the guilt, and will be charged as joining in it. In his remarkable answer to this awful sentence, Eli acknowledged that the Lord had a right to do as he saw good, being assured that he would do nothing wrong. The meekness, patience, and humility contained in those words, show that he was truly repentant; he accepted the punishment of his sin.</body></html>
