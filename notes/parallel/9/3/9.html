As a rule, we find that generally, when the Lord was pleased to take some form, the form is specified. Now, as in Abraham's case at Mamre, it was a traveller; now, as in Joshua's, an armed warrior; very frequently, as to Manoah, the form was that of an angel; here nothing is specially described. Was it not that simply "the glory" on which Moses gazed when he met the Holy One on Sinai--"the glory" which seemed to rest at times in the lightless Holy of Holies on the golden mercy-seat of the Ark of the Covenant? Was it not this "visible glory"--Shekinah. as the Hebrews termed it--which filled the chamber of the child, and from out of <span class= "ital">this </span>came the voice of the Eternal, and spoke to Samuel? "See how God loves holiness in children. The child Samuel was preferred by Him to Eli, the aged high priest and judge."--<span class= "ital">Theodoret, </span>quoted by Bishop Wordsworth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-10 The call which Divine grace designs shall be made effectual; will be repeated till it is so, till we come to the call. Eli, perceiving that it was the voice of God that Samuel heard, instructed him what to say. Though it was a disgrace to Eli, for God's call to be directed to Samuel, yet he told him how to meet it. Thus the elder should do their utmost to assist and improve the younger that are rising up. Let us never fail to teach those who are coming after us, even such as will soon be preferred before us, Joh 1:30. Good words should be put into children's mouths betimes, by which they may be prepared to learn Divine things, and be trained up to regard them.</body></html>
