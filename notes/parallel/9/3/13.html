The old pure religion was rapidly dying out of the hearts of the men, and the profligacy and covetousness of Shiloh would soon have been copied only too faithfully in all the homes of Israel. This fearful state of things was known to the high priest and judge, and still the weak and indulgent father refrained from removing his sons from their high office.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I have told him,</span> etc. These words may be translated, with the Septuagint and Vulgate, "For I have told him that I would judge his house," referring back to the message of the man of God; or, with the Syriac, "And I will show him that I do judge his house." <span class="cmt_word">Forever</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> finally; his house shall pass away. <span class="cmt_word">His sons made themselves vile.</span> The verb used here invariably means <span class="accented">to curse</span>; but "they cursed themselves" does not, without straining, give a good sense. The Septuagint for "themselves" reads <span class="accented">God</span>, and the Syriac <span class="accented">the people.</span> Buxtorf says ('Lex. Rab.,' sub <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>) that the right reading is <span class="accented">me</span>, and that this is one of eighteen places where the scribes have changed <span class="accented">me</span> into <span class="accented">themselves</span> or <span class="accented">them.</span> But while thus there is much uncertainty about the right text, the evidence is too uncertain to act upon, and it is best to translate, "His sons have brought a curse upon themselves," while acknowledging that the ordinary rendering would be "have cursed themselves." <span class="cmt_word">And he restrained them not.</span> The Versions generally take the verb used here as equivalent to one differing only in having a softer medial consonant, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d4;&#x5d4;</span> = <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>, and translate <span class="accented">rebuked</span>; but that really found in the Hebrew text signifies "to weaken, humble, reduce to powerlessness." The A.V. takes neither one verb nor the other in the rendering <span class="accented">restrained.</span> Eli ought to have prevented his sons from persisting in bringing disgrace upon God's service by stripping them of their office. Their wickedness was great, and required a stern and decisive remedy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-18 What a great deal of guilt and corruption is there in us, concerning which we may say, It is the iniquity which our own heart knoweth; we are conscious to ourselves of it! Those who do not restrain the sins of others, when it is in their power to do it, make themselves partakers of the guilt, and will be charged as joining in it. In his remarkable answer to this awful sentence, Eli acknowledged that the Lord had a right to do as he saw good, being assured that he would do nothing wrong. The meekness, patience, and humility contained in those words, show that he was truly repentant; he accepted the punishment of his sin.</body></html>
