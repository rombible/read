The other is an unnecessary correction of the Kri. Having restored to Saul this ensign of his authority, David prays that <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah</span> may <span class="cmt_word">render to every man his righteousness</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> may requite David for his upright conduct towards Saul, and by implication punish Saul himself for his unjust conduct. And also <span class="cmt_word">his faithfulness,</span> his fidelity, and steady allegiance. This refers exclusively to David, who gives as proof of his faithfulness to his king that he had spared his life when it was delivered into his power. In return for which act God, he affirms, will protect his life. Ver. 24 would be better translated, "And behold, as thy life was great (in value) in my sight this day, so shall my life be great (in value) in the sight of Jehovah, and he shall deliver me out of every strait," every narrowness and difficulty into which Saul's persecution might drive him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:21-25 Saul repeated his good words and good wishes. But he showed no evidence of true repentance towards God. David and Saul parted to meet no more. No reconciliation among men is firm, which is not founded in an cemented by peace with God through Jesus Christ. In sinning against God, men play the fool, and err exceedingly. Many obtain a passing view of these truths, who hate and close their eyes against the light. Fair professions do not entitle those to confidence who have long sinned against the light, yet the confessions of obstinate sinners may satisfy us that we are in the right way, and encourage us to persevere, expecting our recompence from the Lord alone.</body></html>
