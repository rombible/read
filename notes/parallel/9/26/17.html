and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen on them.">1Samuel 26:12</a>). When David on his return stood on the opposite ridge, it was still, no doubt, the dawn of early morning. So Saul speaks of hearing <span class= "ital">that </span>voice of David so well known to him, and which once he so dearly loved; he could not as yet discern the figure of his former friend.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is this thy voice?</span> So <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm">1 Samuel 24:16</a>. In the darkness the only way of recognising David was by his voice. <span class="cmt_word">If Jehovah have stirred thee up,</span> etc. This is one of the many passages indicative of the intensity with which the Israelites had grasped the idea of the omnipresence of the Deity, and of his being the one power by whose energy all things exist and all acts are done (see on 1 Samuel 2:2). Alike evil and good come from God, for he alone is the source of all; but it does not therefore follow that everything which he makes possible, or to which his providence seems to lead, is therefore right for man to do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4, 6</a>). On the contrary, all leadings of providence are to be judged by God's immutable law, and the conduct of a Shimei may be absolutely wrong and unjustifiable, even though "Jehovah had bidden him do it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a>). If, indeed, an external command come by the hand of a properly accredited person, it may take the same high position as the published law of God, and so override the conscience; but Shimei's bidding came through the working of his own passions, and was no more binding than the moving of David's mind by Jehovah to number Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>). David, then, here sets forth the two only possible cases: first, Saul may be stirred up by Jehovah to persecute David, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the temptation may come by the working of his own mind under those strong impulses which to the Israelite had in them always something Divine. But this was an impulse to break God's law, and was therefore to be resisted; and just as in modern phrase we should bid a person when strongly moved to some act to carry it to God's throne in prayer, so David urges Saul to seek for the quieting of his emotions in religion. Under holy influences these fierce passions would pass away, and Jehovah would <span class="cmt_word">accept an offering.</span> Hebrew, "would smell it," because the offering, <span class="accented">minchah</span>, consisting of flour and frankincense, was burnt for a sweet odour before God. But, secondly, Saul might be stirred up by the calumnies of wicked men, in which case David prays that they may be <span class="cmt_word">cursed before Jehovah</span>; because by forcing him to leave the covenant land of Israel they virtually say to him, <span class="cmt_word">Go, serve other gods.</span> To a mind so intensely religious as David's, not only was the private devotion of the heart a necessity, but also the taking part in the public worship of the Deity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>); and, therefore, to deprive him of this privilege and expel him from <span class="cmt_word">the inheritance of Jehovah</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the earthly limits of Jehovah's Church, was to force him, as far as his enemies could do so, to be a heathen and a worshipper of strange gods. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:13-20 David reasoned seriously and affectionately with Saul. Those who forbid our attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange us from God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposes us to sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirred thee up against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way to punish me for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; let Him accept an offering from us both. Let us join in seeking peace, and to be reconciled with God by sacrifice.</body></html>
