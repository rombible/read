<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-16.htm" title="This thing is not good that you have done. As the LORD lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.">1Samuel 26:16</a>. The same Hebrew word occurs in the narration of Jacob's dream (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm" title="And he lighted on a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.">Genesis 28:11</a>); it is there rendered in our English Version, "his pillows." It was the tall spear which ever seems to have been in Saul's hand, or placed close to him. We read of it in battle in his hand, and in the council chamber and at the state banquet it was within his reach, and now it was evidently reared upright beside the sleeping king. "I noticed at all the encampments which we passed that the sheik's tent was distinguished from the rest <span class= "ital">by a tall spear </span>stuck upright in the ground in front of it; and it is the custom when a party set out on an excursion for robbery or for war, that when they halt to rest the spot where the chief reclines or rests is thus designated"--Thomson, <span class= "ital">Land and the Book.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - The two accordingly go <span class="cmt_word">by night</span>, or "at night," as soon as night came on, and find Saul asleep <span class="cmt_word">within the trench,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> inside the wagon rampart, as in ver. 5, and <span class="cmt_word">his spear,</span> the sign of his royal authority, stuck in the ground; not <span class="cmt_word">at his bolster,</span> but "at his head; and so in vers. 11, 12, 16. The word literally signifies "the place where the head is." Like David's men in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4</a>, Abishai sees in Saul's defenceless condition a proof that it was God's will that he should die, but there is a difference of language in the Hebrew which the A.V. does not represent. There the word rendered <span class="accented">deliver</span> is really <span class="accented">give</span>; here it is "hath locked up." <span class="cmt_word">At once.</span> Hebrew, "once." Abishai would pierce him through with a single stroke so thoroughly that no second blow would be necessary. The purpose of this would be to prevent an outcry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-12 How soon do unholy hearts lose the good impressions convictions have made upon them! How helpless were Saul and all his men! All as though disarmed and chained, yet nothing is done to them; they are only asleep. How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thought fit to avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to the promised crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong; but if he yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted the temptation, and trusted God with the event.</body></html>
