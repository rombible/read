Keil calls attention here to the special notice in the text that the mountain whence David spoke was afar off, not, as we should say, "as the crow flies," but afar, because a deep steep ravine lay between the camp of Saul and the hill on which David and Abishai stood. "On the previous occasion when, in the cave of En-gedi, the son of Jesse cut off the skirt of the royal garment, David fearlessly cried to Saul when the king was still evidently quite close to the cave. <span class= "ital">Now, </span>however, he seems to have reckoned far less upon any change in the state of Saul's mind than he had done before . . . in fact, he rather feared lest Saul should endeavour to get him into his power as soon as he woke from his sleep."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The top of a hill.</span> Hebrew, "the top of the hill," the particular mountain from which David had reconnoitred Saul's camp (ver. 5). <span class="cmt_word">A great space being between them.</span> At En-gedi Saul was alone, and had placed himself in David's power; he therefore had followed him closely. Here Saul had his army round him, and David had entered his camp by stealth. It is not, therefore, till he had placed an ample interval between them that he calls to <span class="cmt_word">Abner</span>, and asks in derision, <span class="cmt_word">Art thou not a man?</span> The irony is enfeebled by the insertion of the word <span class="accented">valiant</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>). No special valour was needed;any one worthy of the name of man ought to have guarded his master better. <span class="cmt_word">Who is like to thee</span> - Hebrew, "who is as thou" - <span class="cmt_word">in Israel?</span> Among all Saul's subjects there was no one so powerful and highly placed as the commander-in-chief, and he ought to have shown himself worthy of his pre-eminence. Justly, therefore, for neglecting his duty and exposing the king to danger, he and his people were <span class="cmt_word">worthy to die.</span> Hebrew, "sons of death" (see on 1 Samuel 20:31). Finally David bids him search for the king's spear and water bottle, that he may understand how completely Saul had been in his power. It has been suggested that Abner was probably a personal enemy of David, with whom he could never have held the high position which he occupied with his near relative Saul. Possibly instead of dissuading Saul from persecuting David, he stirred up his ill feelings. Still absolutely there is nothing in this banter which was not justified by Abner's official position. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:13-20 David reasoned seriously and affectionately with Saul. Those who forbid our attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange us from God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposes us to sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirred thee up against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way to punish me for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; let Him accept an offering from us both. Let us join in seeking peace, and to be reconciled with God by sacrifice.</body></html>
