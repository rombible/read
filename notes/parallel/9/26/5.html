Keil renders, "by the wagon rampart"; The LXX. translate the Hebrew word by "covered chariots." The meaning is, no doubt, that the king lay down within the barricade or rampart formed by the baggage wagons.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David arose.</span> It seems as if David could scarcely believe that Saul would thus a second time pursue him; but when the scouts informed him that it was really so, he went in person to reconnoitre Saul's camp. From the opposite hill he was able to see that <span class="cmt_word">he lay in the trench,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the barricade formed by the wagons. At night Saul's place would be in the centre, with Abner near him, while the rest would lie sleeping around, but all of them within the rampart. When David reconnoitred them they would probably be arranging their wagons to form this barricade. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-12 How soon do unholy hearts lose the good impressions convictions have made upon them! How helpless were Saul and all his men! All as though disarmed and chained, yet nothing is done to them; they are only asleep. How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thought fit to avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to the promised crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong; but if he yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted the temptation, and trusted God with the event.</body></html>
