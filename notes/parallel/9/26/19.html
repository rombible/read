If, however, we are content to interpret them with Bishop Wordsworth according to the Arabic Version of the Chaldee Targum, the difficulty vanishes: "If the Lord hath stirred thee up against me for any fault of mine, let me know mine offence, and I am ready to make an offering for it to the Lord, that I may be forgiven."--<span class= "ital">Wordsworth. </span>But by far the greater number of scholars and expositors understand the words of David in what seems to be their plain literal sense, viz.: "If Jehovah has incited you to do this evil thing, let Him smell an offering." The word for offering in the Hebrew is <span class= "ital">minchah, </span>the meat offering, which signifies "sanctification of life and devotion to the Lord." In other words, "If you think or feel that <span class= "ital">God </span>stirs you up to take this course against me--the innocent one--pray to God that He may take the temptation--if it be a temptation--from thee." This conception that the movement comes from God runs through the Old Testament. It is apparently expressed in such passages as "the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart," and in such sayings as we find here in this Book of Samuel of an evil spirit <span class= "ital">from the </span>Lord haunting Saul. "Some have explained the conception by referring it to the intensity with which the Israelites had grasped the idea of the omnipresence of the Deity, and of His being the one power by whose energy all things exist and all acts are done; alike evil and good come from God, for He alone is the source of all . . . but it does not follow that everything to which His providence seems to lead is therefore right for man to do; on the contrary, all leadings of Providence are to be judged by God's immutable law."--<span class= "ital">Dean Payne Smith. </span>These seeming leadings must be tested by prayer offered by an earnest heart: that is the meaning of the offering (<span class= "ital">minchah</span>) here. The conception--strange as it may seem at first--is a true one, as in the case of Pharaoh, and also--though with some important modifications--of Saul. The Holy Spirit had pleaded long, and had pleaded in vain. It is possible, we know, for us to <span class= "ital">weary, </span>or, as St. Paul puts it, quench that Spirit of God pleading within us; then at length, wearied or quenched, it wings its flight away from the wicked soul. This spreading its wings in flight may be said to be God's work. The sad and invariable result is, the deserted heart becomes <span class= "ital">hardened, </span>as in the case of Pharaoh; the empty shrine becomes the swept and garnished home for the evil spirit, as in the case of Saul.<p><span class= "bld">But if they <span class= "ital">be </span>the children of men.</span>--But David goes on to say, "If the cruel, unjust thoughts are the result of the envy and hatred of men who are my enemies, may God punish them as they deserve; for see what they have done for me: they have by their calumnies--whispered in your ears--driven me into exile; they have violently bidden me to go and serve other and strange gods." He means that, far away from the only country where Jehovah is loved and honoured, away from the influence of Jehovah's prophets and beloved priests, he and his would be tempted to serve other gods, and to share in the foul and impious practice of the heathen nations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:13-20 David reasoned seriously and affectionately with Saul. Those who forbid our attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange us from God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposes us to sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirred thee up against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way to punish me for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; let Him accept an offering from us both. Let us join in seeking peace, and to be reconciled with God by sacrifice.</body></html>
