The words of Samuel here were reproduced, or at least referred to, by other prophets and teachers of the old dispensation; for example, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/50-8.htm" title="I will not reprove you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.">Psalm 50:8-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/51-16.htm" title="For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.">Psalm 51:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/6-6.htm" title="With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>. Our Lord himself, in His words recorded in Matt. ix, 13, if not actually referring to this passage, makes substantially the same declaration.<p>Irenaeus, <span class= "ital">Haer. </span>4:32 (quoted by Wordsworth), sees in this great saving of Samuel's a plain intimation that the day would come when the burnt offerings enjoined on Israel would give place to a simple worship of the heart. Wordsworth also quotes a weighty comment from St. Gregory (<span class= "ital">Moral. </span>35:10): "In sacrifices (per victimas) a man offers only strange flesh, whereas in obedience he offers his own will."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - The rebuke of Samuel contains one of those pregnant sayings which mark the high moral tone of the teaching of the prophets, and soon became a fundamental principle with them. <span class="cmt_word">To obey is better than sacrifice</span> is a dictum reproduced by Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>), the most ancient of those prophets of Israel whose lessons have been preserved in writing; it is referred to in still earlier psalms (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-13.htm">Psalm 50:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16, 17</a>); by other prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6, 8</a>); and finally received our Lord's special approbation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>). It asserts in the clearest terms the superiority of moral to ritual worship, and that God can only be really served with the heart. <span class="cmt_word">Witchcraft</span> is in the Hebrew <span class="accented">divination</span>, a sin always strongly condemned in the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Iniquity</span> literally means <span class="accented">nothingness</span>, and so is constantly used for "an idol;" and this must be its signification here, as the word coupled with it, and rendered <span class="cmt_word">idolatry</span>, is really <span class="accented">teraphim.</span> These were the Hebrew household gods, answering to the Roman <span class="accented">Lares</span>, and were supposed to bring good luck. Their worship, we see from this place, was strictly forbidden. The verse, therefore, means, "For rebellion is the sin of divination (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> is equal to it in wickedness), and obstinacy (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> intractableness) is an idol and teraphim." Samuel thus accuses Saul of resistance to Jehovah's will, and of the determination at all hazards to be his own master. With this temper of mind he could be no fit representative of Jehovah, and therefore Samuel dethrones him. Henceforward he reigns only as a temporal, and no longer as the theocratic, king. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:10-23 Repentance in God is not a change of mind, as it is in us, but a change of method. The change was in Saul; He is turned back from following me. Hereby he made God his enemy. Samuel spent a whole night in pleading for Saul. The rejection of sinners is the grief of believers: God delights not in their death, nor should we. Saul boasts to Samuel of his obedience. Thus sinners think, by justifying themselves, to escape being judged of the Lord. The noise the cattle made, like the rust of the silver, Jas 5:3, witnessed against him. Many boast of obedience to the command of God; but what means then their indulgence of the flesh, their love of the world, their angry and unkind spirit, and their neglect of holy duties, which witness against them? See of what evil covetousness is the root; and see what is the sinfulness of sin, and notice that in it which above any thing else makes it evil in the sight of the Lord; it is disobedience: Thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord. Carnal, deceitful hearts, like Saul, think to excuse themselves from God's commandments by what pleases themselves. It is hard to convince the children of disobedience. But humble, sincere, and conscientious obedience to the will of God, is more pleasing and acceptable to him than all burnt-offering and sacrifices. God is more glorified and self more denied, by obedience than by sacrifice. It is much easier to bring a bullock or lamb to be burned upon the altar, than to bring every high thought into obedience to God, and to make our will subject to his will. Those are unfit and unworthy to rule over men, who are not willing that God should rule over them.</body></html>
