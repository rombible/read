Not content with intreating words, Saul, perhaps even with some violence, lays hold of the old man as he turns away, to detain him. What Saul laid hold of and tore was not the "mantle" (Authorised Version), but the hem, or outer border, of the "meil," the ordinary tunic which the upper classes in Israel were then in the habit of wearing. The Dean of Canterbury, in a careful Note in the <span class= "ital">Pulpit Commentary, </span>shows that the "mantle," which would be the accurate rendering of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">addereth, </span>the distinctive dress of the Hebrew prophets, was certainly not used in the days of Samuel, the great founder of the prophetic order. Special dresses came into use only gradually, and Elijah is the first person described as being thus clad. Long before his time the school of the prophets had grown into a national institution, and a loose wrapper of coarse cloth, made of camel's-hair, fastened round the body at the waist by a leathern girdle, had become the <span class= "ital">distinctive </span>prophetic dress, and continued to be until the arrival of Israel's last prophet, John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-6.htm" title="And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;">Mark 1:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:24-31 There were several signs of hypocrisy in Saul's repentance. 1. He besought Samuel only, and seemed most anxious to stand right in his opinion, and to gain his favour. 2. He excuses his fault, even when confessing it; that is never the way of a true penitent. 3. All his care was to save his credit, and preserve his interest in the people. Men are fickle and alter their minds, feeble and cannot effect their purposes; something happens they could not foresee, by which their measures are broken; but with God it is not so. The Strength of Israel will not lie.</body></html>
