They were descended from Esau's grandson, Amalek. Not long after the exodus from Egypt, they attacked and cruelly harassed the almost defenceless rear-guard of Israel in the desert of Rephidim. They were then, at the prayer of Moses, defeated by Joshua; but, for this cowardly unprovoked attack, solemnly doomed to destruction. In the prophecy of Balaam they are alluded to as the first of the nations who opposed the Lord's people. During the stormy ages that followed, the hand of Amalek seems to have been constantly lifted against Israel, and we read of them perpetually as allied to their relentless foes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amalek</span>. The Amalekites were a fierce race of nomads who inhabited the desert to the south of Judaea towards Egypt. They were, and still continue to be in their descendants, the Bedouins, an untamable race of savages, whose delight is in robbery and plunder. Between them and Israel there was bitter hostility occasioned by their having attacked the people immediately after the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>), and the command there given to exterminate them is repeated now, probably in consequence of their raids having become more numerous and sanguinary under their present king, as we gather from ver. 33. The reference to a war with the Amalektes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a> no doubt refers to this expedition, as we have there a mere summary of Saul's military enterprises. <span class="cmt_word">I remember.</span> Literally, "I have visited;" but the sense of <span class="accented">remembering</span> seems confirmed by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>. The Septuagint, however, and Aquila, give a very good sense: "I have considered, "thought over." <span class="cmt_word">How he laid wait for him in the way.</span> There is no idea in the Hebrew of ambuscade or treachery. It is simply, "How he set himself in the way against him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> opposed, withstood him, tried to bar his progress. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The sentence of condemnation against the Amalekites had gone forth long before, Ex 17:14; De 25:19, but they had been spared till they filled up the measure of their sins. We are sure that the righteous Lord does no injustice to any. The remembering the kindness of the ancestors of the Kenites, in favour to them, at the time God was punishing the injuries done by the ancestors of the Amalekites, tended to clear the righteousness of God in this dispensation. It is dangerous to be found in the company of God's enemies, and it is our duty and interest to come out from among them, lest we share in their sins and plagues, Re 18:4. As the commandment had been express, and a test of Saul's obedience, his conduct evidently was the effect of a proud, rebellious spirit. He destroyed only the refuse, that was good for little. That which was now destroyed was sacrificed to the justice of God.</body></html>
