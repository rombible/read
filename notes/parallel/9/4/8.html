They are the expression of idolaters who knew of "Gods" and dreaded their malevolent influence, but who had no conception of the One Most High God. The plural form Elohim, so often found in the sacred record for God, is used here; but whereas the inspired compilers would have written <span class= "ital">their </span>qualifying adjective in the singular, the Philistine idolaters write <span class= "ital">theirs </span>in the plural--<span class= "ital">Elohim addirim: </span>Mighty Gods.<p>It is noticeable that the Philistine exclamation of awe and terror is based outwardly upon the Egyptian traditions of the acts of the Lord. They studiedly ignore what they were all in that camp painfully conscious of--His acts in their own land of Canaan. The Septuagint and Syriac Versions, and some commentators, add "and" before the words "in the wilderness," to make the Philistine exclamation more in harmony with history, seeing that the plagues were inflicted <span class= "ital">before </span>the Israelites entered the wilderness; but the very vagueness of the exclamation of fear speaks for its truth. They were little concerned with exact historical accuracy, and were simply conscious of some terrible judgment having fallen on the foes of this Israel, a judgment they not unnaturally connected with the Ark of the Covenant just arrived in the enemy's camp: that Ark their ancestors remembered so often at the head of the armies of this Israel in their days of triumph.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These mighty Gods.</span> In Hebrew <span class="accented">"Elohim</span>, though plural, is used of the one true God, but in this sense has always the verb or adjective belonging to it in the singular. In ver. 7 the Philistines conform to this rule, and say, <span class="cmt_word">Elohim is come;</span> but here the verb, pronoun, and adjective are all plural, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they speak as heathen, to whom polytheism was natural (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With all the plagues.</span> Rather, "with every plague," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with every kind of plague. <span class="cmt_word">In the wilderness.</span> God did not really smite the Egyptians in the wilderness. The plagues, including the destruction of Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, had all happened before the Israelites had entered it. But probably the Philistines confused together the plagues of Egypt and the miracles in the wilderness, and even the conquest of Canaan, in one grand but vague whole, and so were ready to give way to despair, as they called to mind the traditions they had heard of these mighty interpositions of God for his people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-9 Israel is smitten before the Philistines. Sin, the accursed thing, was in the camp, and gave their enemies all the advantage they could wish for. They own the hand of God in their trouble; but, instead of submitting, they speak angrily, as not aware of any just provocation they had given him. The foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord, Pr 19:3, and finds fault with him. They supposed that they could oblige God to appear for them, by bringing the ark into their camp. Those who have gone back in the life of religion, sometimes discover great fondness for the outward observances of it, as if those would save them; and as if the ark, God's throne, in the camp, would bring them to heaven, though the world and the flesh are on the throne in the heart.</body></html>
