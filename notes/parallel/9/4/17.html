the tidings of the death of his two sons, to whom he had been so indulgent, and who, as he had reason to fear, died impenitent, touched him as a father; yet there was a greater concern on his spirit.

A man may die miserably, yet not die eternally; may come to an untimely end, yet the end be peace.</body></html>
