It was not the intelligence of her husband's bloody end on the field of battle, or of her father-in-law's death on his throne, or the downfall of her house, which stirred her so painfully; she could have borne all this better than the news that the Ark of the Covenant was in the hands of the idolatrous enemies of God. Von Gerlach remarks that "the wife of this deeply corrupt man shows how penetrated the whole people then was with the sense of the value of its covenant with God."<p>The meaning of the term I-chabod is much disputed, owing to the doubt which hangs over the first syllable--"I" followed by "chabod." It is usually taken to mean a simple negative; "not:" chabod signifying "glory:" I-chabod thus represents "not glory:" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>there is no glory. Others render the "I" syllable as a query, "Where?" "Where is the glory?" the answer, of course, being, "It is nowhere." But the best rendering seems to be to understand the syllable "I" as an exclamation of bitter sorrow, "Alas !" The name then could be translated, <span class= "ital">"Alas! the glory."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-22 The wife of Phinehas seems to have been a person of piety. Her dying regret was for the loss of the ark, and the departure of the glory from Israel. What is any earthly joy to her that feels herself dying? No joy but that which is spiritual and divine, will stand in any stead then; death is too serious a thing to admit the relish of any earthly joy. What is it to one that is lamenting the loss of the ark? What pleasure can we take in our creature comforts and enjoyments, if we want God's word and ordinances; especially if we want the comfort of his gracious presence, and the light of his countenance? If God go, the glory goes, and all good goes. Woe unto us if he depart! But though the glory is withdrawn from one sinful nation, city, or village after another, yet it shall never depart altogether, but shines forth in one place when eclipsed in another.</body></html>
