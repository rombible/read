But though it was a dead thing, it was inexpressibly precious to the patriot Israelite. Was it not the ark "which Moses had made by God's command at Sinai, and on which the Divine presence was enshrined in the Holy of Holies; and which had accompanied Israel in their marches through the wilderness, and before which the waters of Jordan had fled backward, and the walls of Jericho had fallen down?--<span class= "ital">that </span>ark was taken by idolaters."--<span class= "ital">Bishop Wordsworth.</span><p><span class= "bld">The two sons of Eli . . . were slain.</span>--This was in strict accordance with the saying of the man of God.
