In the sacred text, where numbers are concerned we usually find these varieties of translation and interpretation. The present system of numerals was invented by the Arabs. The Hebrews use the letters of the alphabet to express numbers. Such a system was naturally fruitful in errors of transcription, and thus numbers, and dates especially, in the earlier books of the Old Testament are frequently confused and uncertain. Many of the difficulties which have given so much trouble to commentators have arisen out of the confusion of copyists substituting, through inadvertence, in Hebrew one letter for another. Instead of "his eyes were dim," the more accurate rendering would be <span class= "ital">his eyes were set</span>--were stiff, so that he could no longer see. This, as Keil observes, is a description of the so-called black cataract (amaurosis), which not unfrequently occurs at a very great age from paralysis of the optic nerves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eli was ninety and eight years old.</span> Until the invention by the Arabs of the present system of numerals, all ancient nations had a most cumbrous system of expressing numbers. The Hebrew method was to attach a value to each of the letters of the alphabet, and then add them together, and thus the eighth and nineteenth letters would between them make up ninety-eight. Such a system led to constant mistakes in copying, and thus the numerals in the earlier parts of the Old Testament are beset with uncertainty. Here the Septuagint has <span class="accented">ninety</span>, and the Syriac <span class="accented">seventy-eight.</span> But as Eli was described already as "very old" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>, the Hebrew text is the most probable. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">dim</span> the Hebrew has <span class="accented">set, i.e.</span> Eli was now absolutely blind, as the word expresses the motionless state of the eye when obscured by cataract. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a> a different word is used, rightly there translated "dim," as the disease is one which comes on gradually. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-4.htm">1 Kings 14:4</a> we read that Ahijah was blind from the same cause, and the word is there correctly rendered "set." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-18 The defeat of the army was very grievous to Eli as a judge; the tidings of the death of his two sons, to whom he had been so indulgent, and who, as he had reason to fear, died impenitent, touched him as a father; yet there was a greater concern on his spirit. And when the messenger concluded his story with, The ark of God is taken, he is struck to the heart, and died immediately. A man may die miserably, yet not die eternally; may come to an untimely end, yet the end be peace.</body></html>
