The term "walketh before you implied generally that the kingly office included the guiding and governing the people, as well as the especial duty of leading them in war; from henceforth they must accept his authority on all occasions, not merely in great emergencies. Both king and people must understand that the days when Saul could quietly betake himself to his old pursuits on the farm of the Ephraim hills were now past for ever. He must lead, and they must follow. The metaphor is taken from the usual place of a shepherd in the East, where he goes before his flock. Compare the words of our Lord, who uses the same image of a shepherd walking before his sheep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:">John 10:27</a>): "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they <span class= "ital">follow </span>me."<p><span class= "bld">And I am old and grayheaded.</span>--Here the prophet, with some pathos, refers to the elders' own words at Ramah (chap 8:5). Yes, said the seer, I am old--grown grey in your service; listen to me while I ask you what manner of service that has been. Can any one find in it a flaw? has it not been pure and disinterested throughout?<p><span class= "bld">My sons are with you.</span>--Yes, old indeed, for my offspring are numbered now among the grown men of the people. Possibly, however, a tinge of mortified feeling at the rejection of himself and his family, mixed with a desire to recommend his sons to the favour and goodwill of the nation, is at the bottom of this mention of them.--<span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary. </span>It is evident that these sons, whose conduct as Samuel's deputies had excited the severest criticism on the part of the elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm" title="And said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.">1Samuel 8:5</a>), had been reduced--with the full consent, of course, of their father, who up to this period exercised evidently supreme power in all the coasts of Israel--to the condition of mere private citizens.<p><span class= "bld">From my childhood unto this day.</span>--Samuel's life had in truth been constantly before the public observation from very early days; well known to all were the details of his career--his early consecration under peculiar and exceptional circumstances to the sanctuary service, the fact of the "word of the Lord" coming directly to him when still a boy, his recognition by the people directly afterwards as a prophet, then his restless, unwearied work during the dark days which followed the fall of Shiloh. It was indeed a public life. He would have Israel, now they had virtually rejected his rule, think over that long busy life of his for a moment, and then pronounce a judgment on it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king walketh before you</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> you have now one to protect and lead the nation, whereas my business was to raise its religious and moral life. The metaphor is taken from the position of the shepherd in the East, where he goes before his flock to guide and guard them. On this account the word shepherd or pastor is used in the Bible of the temporal ruler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>, etc.), and not, as with us, of the spiritual guide. <span class="cmt_word">My sons are with you.</span> This is no mere confirmation of the fact just stated that he was old, but a direct challenge of their dissatisfaction with his sons' conduct, as far at least as concerns any connivance on his part, or support of them in their covetousness. Samuel says, You know all about my sons; I do not profess to be ignorant that charges <span class="accented">have</span> been brought against them. Give full weight to them, and to everything said against them and me, and then give judgment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-5 Samuel not only cleared his own character, but set an example before Saul, while he showed the people their ingratitude to God and to himself. There is a just debt which all men to their own good name, especially men in public stations, which is, to guard it against unjust blame and suspicions, that they may finish their course with honour, as well as with joy. And that we have in our places lived honestly, will be our comfort, under any slights and contempt that may be put upon us.</body></html>
