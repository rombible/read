It should run, "If ye will fear the Lord, &c., . . . and if both ye and the king that reigneth over you will follow the Lord your God, <span class= "ital">it shall be well with you." </span>Dean Payne Smith has well caught the spirit of the passage in his note: "Samuel piled up one upon another the conditions of their happiness, and then from the depth of his emotion breaks off, leaving the blessed consequences of their obedience unsaid." The intense wish, "O that you would only fear the Lord! O that you and your king would only continue following!" is contained in the Hebrew particle which introduces these ejaculatory sentences. A similar unfinished sentence will be found in St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-42.htm" title="Saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things which belong to your peace! but now they are hid from your eyes.">Luke 19:42</a>, where the apodosis is left to be supplied.<p>Samuel, with mournful earnestness, would drive home to the hearts of the people and their new king the great truth that the past, full of sin and sorrow, was forgiven--that even their present act, which seemed to border on ingratitude to that Mighty One who deigned to concern Himself with the interests of this fickle people, would bring no evil consequences in its track, if only the people and their king would in the future obey the glorious voice of the Eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye will fear,</span> etc. This verse, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>, is left unfinished, and we must supply <span class="accented">well</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>. For the verse cannot be translated as in the A.V., but is as follows: "If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment (Hebrew, the mouth) of Jehovah, and if both ye and the king that reigneth over you will follow Jehovah your God, <span class="accented">it shall be well."</span> Samuel piles up one upon another the conditions of their happiness, and then from the depth of his emotion breaks off, leaving the blessed consequences of their obedience unsaid. "To follow Jehovah" implies willing and active service as his attendants, going with him where he will, and being ever ready to obey his voice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:6-15 The work of ministers is to reason with people; not only to exhort and direct, but to persuade, to convince men's judgments, and so to gain their wills and affections. Samuel reasons of the righteous acts of the Lord. Those who follow God faithfully, he will enable to continue following him. Disobedience would certainly be the ruin of Israel. We mistake if we think that we can escape God's justice, by trying to shake off his dominion. If we resolve that God shall not rule us, yet he will judge us.</body></html>
