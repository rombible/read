The elders of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-5.htm" title="And he said to them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.">1Samuel 12:5</a>) had with one consent cried out, in reply to Samuel's solemn calling God and the king to witness, <span class= "ital">He is witness. </span>Then Samuel takes up their words with great emphasis, <span class= "ital">even the Eternal that advanced Moses, &c. </span>The English rendering greatly weakens the dramatic force of the original Hebrew. The LXX. has caught accurately the thought by supplying the word "witness ": thus, <span class= "ital">The Lord is witness, &c.</span><p>The Exodus is mentioned in this and in many places in these ancient records of the people as the great call of love by which the Eternal assumed the sovereignty over Israel. The Talmud here comments: "It is the Lord that made Moses and Aaron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-6.htm" title="And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 12:6</a>); and it is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm" title="And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelled safe.">1Samuel 12:11</a>), "And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel." Scripture balances in the same scale the three least important with the three most important personages, in order to teach thee that Jerrubbaal in his generation was like Moses in his, Bedan (said to be Samson) like Aaron, and Jephthah like Samuel. Hence the most insignificant man, if appointed a ruler of the congregation, has the same authority as the most important personage.--Treatise <span class= "ital">Rosh-Hashanah, </span>fol. 25, Colossians 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is Jehovah that,</span> etc. In the Hebrew Jehovah is put absolutely, without any government, and the Septuagint rightly supplies <span class="accented">is witness.</span> Samuel had said, "Jehovah is witness against you;" the people in answer shouted the last word, "Witness" (see end of ver. 5, where <span class="accented">He is</span> is supplied). Then Samuel solemnly repeats Jehovah s name, saying, "Even Jehovah that advanced Moses and Aaron." This rapid interchange of words brings the whole scene vividly before us, whereas nothing could be tamer than the A.V. Out of the land of Egypt. Samuel begins with this as the first act of Jehovah as Israel's King; for the theocracy began with the deliverance from Egypt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:6-15 The work of ministers is to reason with people; not only to exhort and direct, but to persuade, to convince men's judgments, and so to gain their wills and affections. Samuel reasons of the righteous acts of the Lord. Those who follow God faithfully, he will enable to continue following him. Disobedience would certainly be the ruin of Israel. We mistake if we think that we can escape God's justice, by trying to shake off his dominion. If we resolve that God shall not rule us, yet he will judge us.</body></html>
