but there was a hope of being able to compass his enemy's destruction, either through treachery or a hand-to-hand encounter, in a confined space like a city with bars and gates, such as Keilah. Saul and his counsellors knew too well whom they had to deal with in the case of the citizens of that faithless, thankless city. It is strange, after all that had passed, that Saul could delude himself that <span class= "ital">his </span>cause was the cause of God, and that David was the reprobate and rejected. The Hebrew word here is remarkable: God hath "repudiated or rejected him." The LXX. renders "sold him" (into my hands).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - It was well nigh a hopeless matter to hunt David as long as he remained on the borders of the desert of Judah, but once shut up in a town his capture was inevitable. When Saul, therefore, heard that David was at Keilah, he said, <span class="cmt_word">God hath delivered him into my hand</span>. The Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate translate in the same way, probably as the nearest equivalent to the Hebrew, while the Septuagint has a different reading - <span class="accented">sold</span>. The Hebrew phrase is a very strong one; literally, "God hath ignored him," hath treated him as a stranger, and so let, him fall "into my hand." Possibly Saul s metaphor was taken from the popular language, and no attempt should be made to get rid of unusual expressions, as if they were false readings. <span class="cmt_word">By entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</span> Either the people of a walled town would give up David rather than expose themselves to the horrors of a siege (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-21.htm">2 Samuel 20:21, 22</a>), or, if they stood by him, its capture would be a mere matter of time. David, it seems, would have run the risk, but happily was prevented. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:7-13 Well might David complain of his enemies, that they rewarded him evil for good, and that for his love they were his adversaries. Christ was used thus basely. David applied to his great Protector for direction. No sooner was the ephod brought him than he made use of it. We have the Scriptures in our hands, let us take advice from them in doubtful cases. Say, Bring hither the Bible. David's address to God is very solemn, also very particular. God allows us to be so in our addresses to him; Lord, direct me in this matter, about which I am now at a loss. God knows not only what will be, but what would be, if it were not hindered; therefore he knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and how to render to every man according to his works.</body></html>
