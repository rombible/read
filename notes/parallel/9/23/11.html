In their logical sequence, of course the second, respecting Saul's coming down, should have been put first, for the men of Keilah could not have delivered him into Saul's hands if Saul had not come down. Dean Payne Smith suggests that in David's earnest prayer "his two questions are put inversely to the logical order, but in accordance with the relative importance in his mind." The Dean thinks "that when the ephod was brought forward, the questions were of course put, and replied to in their logical sequence.<p>"And the Lord said, He will come down."<p>" And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up."<p>Thus the answer of the Urim and Thummin was given to the questions in their logical order. The Talmud has an interesting comment here. In consulting the Urim and Thummim, the enquirer is not to ask about <span class= "ital">two things at a time, </span>for if he does, he will be answered about <span class= "ital">one only, </span>and only about the one he first uttered, as it is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/23-11.htm" title="Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.">1Samuel 23:11-12</a>). David asked first "Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hands?" and then he asked also "Will Saul come down?" The answer was to the <span class= "ital">second </span>query. "And the Lord said He will come down." But it has just been asserted that the enquirer will be answered only about the one thing he first uttered. To this it is replied, David framed his enquiry not <span class= "ital">in good order, </span>but the reply of the Urim and Thummim was as though the enquiry had been <span class= "ital">in proper order. </span>Hence when David became aware that his question had not been put properly, he repeated it again in better order, as it has been said, "Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Yoma, </span>fol. 73, Colossians 1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:7-13 Well might David complain of his enemies, that they rewarded him evil for good, and that for his love they were his adversaries. Christ was used thus basely. David applied to his great Protector for direction. No sooner was the ephod brought him than he made use of it. We have the Scriptures in our hands, let us take advice from them in doubtful cases. Say, Bring hither the Bible. David's address to God is very solemn, also very particular. God allows us to be so in our addresses to him; Lord, direct me in this matter, about which I am now at a loss. God knows not only what will be, but what would be, if it were not hindered; therefore he knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and how to render to every man according to his works.</body></html>
