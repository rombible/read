Some of these "stations" in the wanderings of the future king are only doubtfully identified. Cowper's musical--though perhaps, according to our recent canons of taste, old-fashioned--lines well describe the Psalmist-king's weary wanderings during this portion of his chequered career:--<p>"See Judah's promised king bereft of all,<p>Driven out an exile from the face of Saul.<p>To distant caves the lonely wanderer flies,<p>To seek that peace a tyrant's frown denies.<p>His soul exults; hope animates his lays;<p>The sense of mercy kindles into praise;<p>And wilds familiar with the lion s roar<p>Ring with ecstatic sounds unheard before."<p>COWPER.<p><span class= "bld">Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him.</span>--This is merely a general remark, and intended to cover a long period of time, including the remaining portion of Saul's reign, during which David was perpetually exposed to Saul's attempts to destroy him. It quietly mentions also that though Saul was armed with all the power of the king in Israel, he was powerless, for the invisible King of Israel declined to give this hated David into his hand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strong holds.</span> Natural fortresses in the woods and mountains are meant, and places difficult of access. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness of Ziph.</span> This lay to the south of Hebron, upon the edge of the great desert of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saul sought him every day.</span> The pursuit was maintained constantly, with men always spying David's movements, and ready to report to Saul any opportunity of seizing him; but apparently there was no body of men at present perpetually in quest of him. <span class="cmt_word">In a wood.</span> Many rightly regard this as a proper name, <span class="accented">Horesh</span>, and as the same place as the <span class="cmt_word">mountain</span> mentioned in ver. 14; for, as Conder remarks ('Tent Work,' 2:89), "a moment's reflection will convince any traveller that, as the dry, porous formation of the plateau must be unchanged since David's time, no wood of trees can then have flourished over this unwatered and sun-scorched region ." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:14-18 David made no attempt against Saul; he kept God's way, waited God's time, and was content to secure himself in woods and wildernesses. Let it make us think the worse of this world, which often gives such bad treatment to its best men: let it make us long for that kingdom where goodness shall for ever be in glory, and holiness in honour. We find Jonathan comforting David. As a pious friend, he directed him to God, the Foundation of his comfort. As a self-denying friend, he takes pleasure in the prospect of David's advancement to the throne. As a constant friend, he renewed his friendship with him. Our covenant with God should be often renewed, and therein our communion with him kept up. If the converse of one friend, at one meeting, gives comfort and strengthens our hearts, what may not be expected from the continual supports and powerful love of the Saviour of sinners, the covenanted Friend of believers!</body></html>
