But Gad the prophet was with David, and the enquiry was made, no doubt, through him. We know that such enquiries were made through prophets, for we possess a detailed account of such an enquiry being made by Jehoshaphat of the prophet Micaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-5.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD to day.">1Kings 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/22-7.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?">1Kings 22:7-8</a>), in which passage the same formula is used as in this case. The Talmud too, when discussing the enquiries made through the Urim and Thummim, whilst dwelling on the greater weight of the decision pronounced by the sacred stones, assumes that questions were also asked <span class= "ital">through the prophets. </span>"The decree pronounced by a prophet is revocable, but the decision of the Urim and Thummim is irrevocable."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Yoma, </span>fol. 73 Colossians 1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David enquired of Jehovah.</span> This seems to show that Abiathar was already with David, as the prophet Gad had no ephod, and at this time, and for a considerable period subsequently, the usual way of consulting God was by the Urim and Thummim (see ver. 6). Though the answer was a command to go, yet David's men hesitated; not that they had any doubt of the immediate result, but, regarding Saul as their most dangerous enemy, they were unwilling to embroil themselves also with the Philistines. They argue, <span class="cmt_word">We be afraid here in Judah</span>: why then should we close the Philistine territory against us by attacking their <span class="cmt_word">armies</span>! Hebrew, "ranks," men disciplined and drawn up in array (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-22.htm">1 Samuel 17:22</a>). In order to remove these prudential doubts, David again consults God, and being a second time encouraged to undertake the rescue of Keilah, proceeds thither with his men. This attack, being unexpected, was entirely successful. The Philistines were driven back with great slaughter, and David <span class="cmt_word">brought away their cattle.</span> The word signifies "small cattle," such as sheep and goats. Besides robbing the threshing floors, the Philistines apparently had been driving off the flocks from the neighbouring pastures. Both Hareth, where David and his men had lain hid in the thickets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a>), and Keilah were in the tribe of Judah, in the southern portion of the Shephelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-6 When princes persecute God's people, let them expect vexation on all sides. The way for any country to be quiet, is to let God's church be quiet in it: if Saul fight against David, the Philistines fight against his country. David considered himself the protector of the land. Thus did the Saviour Jesus, and left us an example. Those are unlike David, who sullenly decline to do good, if they are not rewarded for services.</body></html>
