On Saul's heart, thus prepared for action, the Holy Spirit fell, and endued him with extraordinary wisdom, valour, and power for the great and difficult work which lay before him.<p>We read of the Spirit of the Lord coming upon men like Othniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a>) and the other great Israelitic judges, who were raised up to be in their day the deliverers of the people; and the immediate result of the Spirit of the Lord coming upon them was to impart new and unusual power to their spirit, power which enabled them successfully to surmount every danger and difficulty which barred the progress of the great work they were specially called upon to do.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Spirit of God came upon Saul.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">descended mightily</span> upon Saul (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>). No miraculous influence is here meant; far more full of meaning and piety is the lesson so constantly taught in the Book of Judges, that all mighty and noble acts are from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14</a>, etc.). Even the heathen saw in enthusiasm something Divine, for it means the having God within. The energy with which Saul acted was strictly natural, but yet as truly Divine; and it is a sign of the irreligion of modern days that it can see and hear of great and heroic achievements and assign no part in them to God. In the days of Samuel and the judges the whole glory of such acts was ascribed to God. But equally now, whenever men are moved to noble acts, it is "the breath of God" that descends upon them and inspires them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-11 The first fruit of Saul's government was the rescue of Jabesh-gilead from the Ammonites. To save their lives, men will part with liberty, and even consent to have their eyes put out; is it then no wisdom to part with that sin which is as dear to us as our right eye, rather than to be cast into hell-fire? See the faith and confidence of Saul, and, grounded thereon, his courage and resolution. See also his activity in this business. When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon men, it will make them expert, even without experience. When zeal for the glory of God, and love for the brethren, urge men to earnest efforts, and when God is pleased to help, great effects may speedily be produced.</body></html>
