Saul evidently shared to the full in the love of trees common among the Israelites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a>). The Hebrew word for pomegranate is Rimmon, but there is no doubt that the tree is here meant, and not the rock Rimmon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45, 47</a>), so called probably from a fancied resemblance to the fruit. <span class="cmt_word">Migron</span>, said to mean a <span class="accented">cliff</span> was apparently a common name for localities in this mountainous district, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a> we read of one lying to the north of Michmash, whereas this is to the south. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-15 Saul seems to have been quite at a loss, and unable to help himself. Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God's protection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make up matters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whose hearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers who prophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse and impression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct the steps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to him for direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance. Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observed turns of Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It is called a trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling they could not resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came at once from the hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make it tremble.</body></html>
