We know nothing of Saul's queen besides her name. It has been surmised that she was of the family of Eli, the high priest, owing to the <span class= "ital">Ah </span>(brother) entering into her name and that of her father, Ahimaaz, as this compound was apparently the favourite prefix to names in this great and renowned house. The simplicity and modesty of the king's domestic habits is evident. Ewald thinks from this circumstance that he had only this one wife and one concubine, Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, afterwards so famous for her sad misfortunes and for her devoted love to her ill-fated children. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/21-8.htm" title="But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:">2Samuel 21:8-12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The captain of his host was Abner.</span>--This "cousin"--or, as some have understood the sentence, the uncle--of King Saul was evidently a man of rare powers and ability. The brilliant campaigns of this reign were, no doubt, in no small measure owing to the military skill of this great commander. After the terrible disaster on Mount Gilboa, Abner was the mainstay of the house of the dead King Saul, and when he died the generous David followed the bier, and lamented over him with a lamentation which has come down to us in words ever memorable: "Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel." His son Jaasiel was subsequently allowed the first place in the tribe of Benjamin. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-21.htm" title="Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:">1Chronicles 27:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz.</span> We have noticed on ver. 3 the fondness of the family of Eli for names beginning with <span class="accented">Ah</span>, "brother."
