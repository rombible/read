The watchmen of Saul were well able to see the scene of dire confusion in the outposts, a confusion which they could discern was rapidly spreading through the more distant camp of the main body.<p>The Hebrew words, <span class= "ital">vay?leh vah?lom, </span>in the last clause of the verse, have been variously rendered; the Rabbinical interpretation is the best: "magis magisque pangebatur"--"were more and more broken up." This takes <span class= "ital">h?lom </span>as an infinitive absolute. The LXX. considers this word an adverb, and translates <span class= "ital">enthen hai enthen, </span>hither and thither, and does not attempt to give any rendering for <span class= "ital">vay?leh.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The watchmen,</span> etc. Condor says ('Tent Work,' 2:115), "The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin must have seen dearly across the chasm the extraordinary conflict of two men against a host, as the 'multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.' The noise in the host was also, no doubt, clearly heard at the distance of only two miles, and the army would have crossed the passage with comparatively little difficulty by the narrow path which leads down direct from Geba to Michmash, west of the Philistine camp. Thence the pursuit was towards Bethel, across the watershed, and headlong down the steep descent of Aijalon - that same pass where the first great victory of Joshua had been gained, and where the valiant Judas was once more, in later times, to drive back the enemies of Israel to the plains." <span class="cmt_word">The multitude.</span> The Hebrew is, "And behold the tumult (the word is so rendered in ver. 19, margin) was reeling and going... and thither." Of course <span class="accented">hither</span> has dropped out of the text before and <span class="accented">thither</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate both read "hither and thither." Tumult means the din made by a confused mass of people, and so the crowd itself. <span class="cmt_word">Melted away</span> does not give the exact meaning. The Philistines were not dispersing, but were <span class="accented">reeling</span>, moving to and fro purposeless, and in confusion. It may mean, however, to <span class="accented">shake</span> or <span class="accented">melt with terror, as</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">art dissolved.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:16-23 The Philistines were, by the power of God, set against one another. The more evident it was that God did all, the more reason Saul had to inquire whether God would give him leave to do any thing. But he was in such haste to fight a fallen enemy, that he would not stay to end his devotions, nor hear what answer God would give him. He that believeth, will not make such haste, nor reckon any business so urgent, as not to allow time to take God with him.</body></html>
