and the battle spread in the whole city, in the mountains of Ephraim; and Saul committed a great error." The number 10,000 is not an improbable one, as the original small force which had kept with Saul and Jonathan had been joined by the Hebrew auxiliaries in the Philistine camp, and also by many of the fugitives from the villages around. They were, we read, "distressed," that is, were wearied out by the long pursuit on the Ephraim hills.<p><span class= "bld">For Saul had adjured the people.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And Saul, </span>&c.; that is, the king was so intent upon his vengeance--so bent upon pursuing to the uttermost these Philistines who so long had defied his power, and who had brought him so low--that he grudged his soldiers the necessary rest and refreshment, and, with a terrible vow, devoted to death any one who should on that day of blood slack his hand for a moment, even to take food.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Israel were distressed that day.</span> The word is that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a> of the state of terror and alarm to which the Israelites were reduced by the Philistine invasion; here it refers to their weariness and faintness for want of food. <span class="cmt_word">For Saul had adjured the people.</span> Hebrew, "had made the people swear." He had recited before them the words of the curse, and made them shout their consent. His object was to prevent any delay in the pursuit; but in his eagerness he forgot that the strength of his men would fail if their bodily wants were not supplied. But though worn out and fainting, the people faithfully keep the oath put to them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:24-35 Saul's severe order was very unwise; if it gained time, it lost strength for the pursuit. Such is the nature of our bodies, that daily work cannot be done without daily bread, which therefore our Father in heaven graciously gives. Saul was turning aside from God, and now he begins to build altars, being then most zealous, as many are, for the form of godliness when he was denying the power of it.</body></html>
