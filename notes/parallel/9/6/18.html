They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.">1Samuel 6:4</a>). The truth was that whilst the human sickness was confined to the five cities, the plague of field mice no doubt extended over the whole country. The inhabitants of all the villages were anxious to do their part to propitiate the insulted Hebrew God, and to get rid of the plague which was devastating their fields and vineyards; hence this large offering, so much in excess of what was suggested by the diviners.<p><span class= "bld">The great stone of Abel.</span>--The LXX. Version reads here, "And this great stone on which they placed the Ark of Jehovah, which is in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, is a witness unto this day." With this reading the Chaldee Targum substantially agrees. The Hebrew text here is hopelessly corrupt; the copies which the Greek translators and the Chaldee Targumist apparently had before them, instead of the word "Avel" (Abel), which signifies mourning, read the word <span class= "ital">?ven, </span>a stone, and the punctuation of <span class= "ital">v'ad, </span>"and unto," in the last clause was evidently (<span class= "ital">v'ed</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>"and a witness." If the reading Avel be the true one ("even unto the great Avel"), then the conjecture of R. D. Kimchi is probably right, that this stone was known as the Great Avel (or Abel), "the great mourning," owing to the terrible judicial calamity, related in the next three verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/6-19.htm" title="And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and three score and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.">1Samuel 6:19-21</a>), which happened there. With this slight change a very good sense is obtained.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:10-18 These two kine knew their owner, their great Owner, whom Hophin and Phinehas knew not. God's providence takes notice even of brute creatures, and serves its own purposes by them. When the reapers saw the ark, they rejoiced; their joy for that was greater than the joy of harvest. The return of the ark, and the revival of holy ordinances, after days of restraint and trouble, are matters of great joy.</body></html>
