From its use in the cognate languages it is pretty certain that it is rightly translated in our version. But besides these there were <span class="cmt_word">golden mice, according to the number of all the cities,</span> etc. The priests had named only five mice, one for each of the lords of the Philistines; but the eagerness of the people outran their suggestion, and not only the fenced towns, but even the unwalled villages sent their offering, lest they should still be chastised. <span class="cmt_word">Country villages.</span> Literally, "the village" or "hamlet of the Perazi." The Septuagint, a trustworthy authority in such matters, makes the Perazi the same as the Perizzite. Both words really signify "the inhabitant of the lowland," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the plain country of Phoenicia; but from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>, where Perazoth is translated "towns without walls," and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>, where it is rendered "unwalled villages," we may conclude that it had come popularly to mean an open village, though literally, in both these places, it means "the hamlets of the lowland." <span class="cmt_word">Even unto the great stone of Abel,</span> etc. All this part of the verse is exceedingly corrupt, and requires large interpolations to obtain from it any meaning. Both the Vulgate and the Syriac retain the unmeaning word Abel; but the Septuagint gives us what is probably the true reading: "and the great stone whereon they set the ark of Jehovah, which is in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite, is a witness unto this day" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-52.htm">Genesis 31:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:10-18 These two kine knew their owner, their great Owner, whom Hophin and Phinehas knew not. God's providence takes notice even of brute creatures, and serves its own purposes by them. When the reapers saw the ark, they rejoiced; their joy for that was greater than the joy of harvest. The return of the ark, and the revival of holy ordinances, after days of restraint and trouble, are matters of great joy.</body></html>
