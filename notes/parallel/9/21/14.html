In old times, as now, in many parts of the East, the insane are looked upon as persons in some peculiar way possessed by, and therefore under the more immediate protection of, Deity. The life then of the hunted fugitive was perfectly safe from the moment the Philistines considered him mad.<p>There is a curious legend in the Talmud in which several events recorded in the Biblical account are confused. Part of it apparently refers to this strange choice of his of Phillstia as a place of refuge. "One day <span class= "ital">Satan </span>appeared to him (David) in the shape of a gazelle, which, eluding his pursuit, decoyed him into the land of the Philistines. 'Ah!' said Ishbi-benob, when he caught sight of him, 'art thou the man that slew my brother, Goliath?' So saying, he seized and bound him."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 95, cols 1, 2. The wild legend goes on to explain how, partly by miracle, partly with the aid of Abishai, David slew Ishbi-benob and escaped.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The man is mad.</span> Achish supposes that David's madness was real, and "drove him away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, title). Here we have only his contemptuous words, declaring that he had madmen enough of his own, and needed no more. As madmen were looked upon in old time as possessed by the Deity, and therefore as persons who must not be interfered with, they probably presumed upon the liberty granted them, and gave much annoyance. <span class="cmt_word">In my presence.</span> Rather, "against me." Achish feared personal injury. <span class="cmt_word">Shall this fellow come into my house?</span> A strong negative taking the form of a question. It means, David shall not enter into my service (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, title).

David had reason to put confidence in Achish, yet he began to be afraid. His conduct was degrading, and discovered wavering in his faith and courage. The more simply we depend on God, and obey him, the more comfortably and surely we shall walk through this troublesome world.</body></html>
