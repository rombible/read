The poem in question is, however, of a general, not of an historical character, and especially celebrates Jehovah's guardian care of the righteous. Its "acrostic" arrangement, however, suggests a later date than the time of David. If, as is quite possible, the royal psalmist was the original author, and that the deliverance on the present occasion suggested the theme, then it must have been brought into its present form by some later temple musician.<p><span class= "bld">Feigned himself mad.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">he roamed hither and thither</span>, <span class= "ital">restless and in terror.</span>--Dean Payne Smith. "In their hands," that is, "in their presence." Some have supposed that the madness was not "simulated," but <span class= "ital">real. </span>Wrought upon by excitement of fear and terrible anxiety, it has been suggested that the mind for a time lost its balance, and that David became temporarily really insane; but the sense of the narrative plainly indicates that the madness was feigned.<p><span class= "bld">Scrabbled on the doors of the gate.</span>--Scratched on them; "scrabble" being probably a diminutive of "scrape" (Richardson, <span class= "ital">Dictionary</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>By others it is connected with "scribble." the root in either case being ultimately the same. The LXX. and Vulg. apparently translate from a slightly different word, and instead of "scrabbled," render "drummed" (<span class= "ital">impingebat</span>) on the wings of the doors.<p><span class= "bld">Let his spittle fall.</span>--That is, allowed the foam which comes from the mouth of a madman to hang about his beard. It has been cleverly suggested that David was only too well acquainted with all the signs of madness, from his long and intimate association with King Saul in his darker hours of insanity. There are other well-authenticated examples in history of great heroes, in seasons of sore danger, feigning madness like David, with a view of escaping from their enemies. For instance, according to the Shahnameh, Kai Khosrev feigned idiocy in face of mortal peril.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He changed his behaviour.</span> The same word is used in the title of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>. Literally it means "his taste," and, like the Latin word <span class="accented">sapientia</span>, is derived from the action of the palate, and so from the faculty of discriminating flavours it came to signify the power of discrimination generally. Thus "to change his taste" means to act as if he had lost the power of distinguishing between objects. <span class="cmt_word">Feigned himself mad.</span> Literally, "he roamed hither and thither" restlessly and in terror. <span class="cmt_word">In their hands.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> before them, in their presence. <span class="cmt_word">Scrabbled on the doors of the gate.</span> The Vulgate and Septuagint read <span class="accented">drummed</span> upon them. Literally the verb means "to make the mark of a Tau," the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and which anciently was in the form of a cross. The gate, on the leaves of which David scrawled, was probably that of the court or waiting room, in which the servants of Achish passed their time when in attendance upon him. Possibly David had witnessed these symptoms of madness in Saul's case during his fits of insanity. The idea of some of the older commentators, that David really for a time went out of his mind, is opposed to the general sense of the narrative. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:10-15 God's persecuted people have often found better usage from Philistines than from Israelites. David had reason to put confidence in Achish, yet he began to be afraid. His conduct was degrading, and discovered wavering in his faith and courage. The more simply we depend on God, and obey him, the more comfortably and surely we shall walk through this troublesome world.</body></html>
