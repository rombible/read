He hoped, too, in that friendly and powerful religious centre to provide himself and his few companions with arms and other necessaries for his exile; nor is it improbable that he purposed, through the friendly high priest, to make some inquiry of the Divine oracle, the Urim and Thuinmim, concerning his doubtful future. The unexpected presence of Doeg, the powerful and unscrupulous servant of Saul, at the sanctuary, no doubt hurried him away in hot haste across the frontier.<p>The town of Nob, situated between Anathoth and Jerusalem--about an hour's ride from the latter--has been with great probability identified with the "village of Esau," El-Isaurizeb, a place bearing all the marks of an ancient town, with its many marble columns and ancient stones. There, in these latter days of Saul, "stood the last precious relic of the ancient nomadic times--the tabernacle of the wanderings, round which, since the fall of Shiloh, had dwelt the descendants of the house of Eli. It was a little colony of priests; no less than eighty-five persons ministered there in the white linen dress of the priesthood, and all their families and herds were gathered round them. The priest was not so ready to befriend as the prophet (we allude to David's reception by Samuel at Naioth by Ramah, 1 Samuel 19). As the solitary fugitive, famished and unarmed, stole up the mountain side, he met with but a cold welcome from the cautious and courtly Ahimelech."--Stanley, <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church, </span>Lect. 12<p><span class= "bld">To Ahimelech the priest.</span>--He was the great grandson of Eli, thus--<p>Died at Shiloh after news of capture of Ark,<p>Eli<p>Phinehas<p>Ahitub<p>Ichabod<p>Ahimelech<p>Abiathar.<p>Slain by Philistines in battle<p>Reign of Saul--High Priest,<p>Reign of David--High Priest, (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/22-19.htm" title="And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.">1Samuel 22:19-20</a>.)<p>He was probably identical with Ahiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm" title="And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.">1Samuel 14:3</a>); this, however, is not certain. Dean Payne Smith believes Ahiah was a younger brother of Ahimelech, who, while Ahimelech remained with the Ark, acted as high priest at the camp for Saul, especially in consulting God for him by means of the ephod with the breastplate (the Urim).<p><span class= "bld">Why art thou alone?</span>--The not unfriendly but cautious priest, who, though unaware of the final rupture of Saul and David, was of course cognisant of the strained relations of the king and his great servant, was uneasy at this sudden appearance of the king's son-in-law--the well-known military chieftain, David--alone and travel-stained at the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came David to Nob.</span> Nob means a <span class="accented">knoll</span> or <span class="accented">hill</span>, and apparently was situated a little to the north of Jerusalem on the road leading to Gath. The ark had evidently been removed thither by Saul early in his reign, after it had remained for twenty years in the house of Abinadab; and as eighty-five priests wearing an ephod were murdered there by Doeg at Saul's command (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18, 19</a>), it is plain that the worship of Jehovah had been restored by him with something of its old splendour. And this agrees with Saul's character. At the commencement of his reign we find Ahiah with him as high priest, and even when he fell his excuse was the necessity for performing the public rites of religion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-15.htm">1 Samuel 15:15</a>). But with him the king's will was first, the will of Jehovah second; and while he restores God's public worship as part of the glory of his reign, he ruthlessly puts the priests with their wives and families to death when he supposes that they have given aid to his enemy. <span class="cmt_word">Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David.</span> More literally, "went trembling to meet David." Ahiah, described as high priest in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>, was either dead or, more probably, was a younger brother, who, while Ahimelech remained with the ark, acted as high priest at the camp for Saul, especially in consulting God for him by means of the ephod with the breastplate. <span class="cmt_word">Why art thou alone?</span> Nevertheless, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a> our Lord speaks of those "who were with David," and the "young men" are mentioned in vers. 4, 5. While David went alone to consult Ahimelech, that his visit might be kept quite secret, he had taken a few of his servants with him, and had left them somewhere in the neighbourhood, or even, more probably, had instructed some one to meet him with such men as he could collect. The arrival of the king's son-in-law without an escort would naturally strike the high priest as strange, and therefore as alarming. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 David, in distress, fled to the tabernacle of God. It is great comfort in a day of trouble, that we have a God to go to, to whom we may open our cases, and from whom we may ask and expect direction. David told Ahimelech a gross untruth. What shall we say to this? The Scripture does not conceal it, and we dare not justify it; it was ill done, and proved of bad consequence; for it occasioned the death of the priests of the Lord. David thought upon it afterward with regret. David had great faith and courage, yet both failed him; he fell thus foully through fear and cowardice, and owing to the weakness of his faith. Had he trusted God aright, he would not have used such a sorry, sinful shift for his own preservation. It is written, not for us to do the like, no, not in the greatest straits, but for our warning. David asked of Ahimelech bread and a sword. Ahimelech supposed they might eat the shew-bread. The Son of David taught from it, that mercy is to be preferred to sacrifice; that ritual observances must give way to moral duties. Doeg set his foot as far within the tabernacle as David did. We little know with what hearts people come to the house of God, nor what use they will make of pretended devotion. If many come in simplicity of heart to serve their God, others come to observe their teachers and to prove accusers. Only God and the event can distinguish between a David and a Doeg, when both are in the tabernacle.</body></html>
