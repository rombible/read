The servant points out to him the tower of the then famous residence of the seer and judge, Samuel. "Will you not ask him," suggests the servant, "about the missing beasts?"--the young countryman, in the simplicity of his heart, thinking the occasion of the loss of his master's asses a sufficient one to warrant an intrusion upon the prophet-judge of Israel. The relation, however, between Samuel and the people must have been of a very close and friendly nature, else it would never have occurred, even to a simple countryman--as probably <span class= "ital">then </span>Saul's servant was--to have sought the advice of one so great as Samuel in such a matter. It says, too, much for the old prophet's kindly, unselfish disposition that his name was thus loved and honoured, even in the secluded farms of the Land of Promise.<p><span class= "bld">An honourable man.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">one held in honour.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this city.</span> Probably Ramathaim-zophim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Ramah, Samuel's dwelling place and property. Confessedly, however, Saul's route hither and thither in search of lost cattle is very obscure, and it is difficult to reconcile this identification with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, that Rachel's sepulchre lay on the route between this city and Gibeah of Saul. Nevertheless, Ramah was certainly in the land of Zuph, whence too it took its longer name (see on 1 Samuel 1:1); and it is remarkable that Jeremiah (1 Samuel 31:15) describes Rachel's weeping as being heard in Ramah. It seems extraordinary that Saul should have known nothing of Israel's chief ruler, and that his servant was acquainted with him only in his lower capacity as a person to be consulted in private difficulties. He describes him, nevertheless, as <span class="cmt_word">an honourable man,</span> or, more literally, an honoured man, one held in honour. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 Saul readily went to seek his father's asses. His obedience to his father was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they were now at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Wherever we are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to get wisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to make them up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, in seeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how to secure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consulted and honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how to escape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people would rather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not their money, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it; but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value they put upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times, always to bring a present to those in authority.</body></html>
