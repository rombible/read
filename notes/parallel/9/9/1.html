We are in most cases left in ignorance respecting the precise method by which God communicated with these highly-favoured men--His elect servante. The chosen Israelite whom Samuel was to anoint as the first king in Israel would meet the prophet--so said the "word of the Lord" to Samuel--on a certain day and hour, at a given place. The ninth chapter begins with a short account of the family of this man chosen for so high an office, and after a word or two of personal description, goes on to relate the circumstances under which he met Samuel. Saul, a man in the prime of manhood, distinguished among his fellows by his great stature, and for his grace and manly beauty, was the son of a noble and opulent Benjamite of Gribeah, a small city in the south of the Land of Promise.<p>The whole of this episode in our ancient book is singularly picturesque. We see the yet unproclaimed king occupied in his father's business, and throwing his whole powers into the every-day transactions of the farm on the slopes of Mount Ephraim. In a few words the historian describes how the modest and retiring Saul was roused from the quiet pastoral pursuits in which his hitherto uneventful life had been spent. The reverent, perhaps slightly reluctant, admiration with which the seer of God gazed at the future king of Israel; the prophet's significant address, the symbol gifts, the graceful hospitality, and, above all, the solemn and, no doubt, burning words of the generous old man, woke up the sleeping hero-spirit, and prepared the young Benjamite for his future mighty work. But there was no vulgar elation at the prospect which lay before him, no hurried grasping at the splendid prize which the seer told him the God of his fathers had destined for him. Quietly he took leave of the famous Samuel; the predicted signs of his coming greatness one by one were literally fulfilled; but Saul returned to the ancestral farm in the hills of Benjamin, and was subject to his father, as in old days; and when at last the public summons to the throne came to him, he seems to have accepted the great office for which he had been marked with positive reluctance and shrinking, nor does he appear materially to have altered his old simple way of living until a great national disgrace called for a devoted patriot <span class= "ital">to </span>avenge it. Then the heroic heart of the Lord's anointed awoke, and Saul, when the hour came, showed himself a king indeed.<p><span class= "bld">Kish, the son of Abiel.</span>--On comparison with the genealogical summaries given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm" title="Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.">1Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm" title="And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.">1Samuel 14:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/7-6.htm" title="The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.">1Chronicles 7:6-8</a>, &c, the line of Samuel appears as follows:--<p>BENJAMIN BECHER<p>"<p>APHIAH (qu. ABIAH)<p>"<p>BECHORAH<p>"<p>ZEROR (qu. ZUR)<p>"<p>ABIEL<p>"<p>NER<p>"<p>KISH<p>"<p>SAUL.<p>Yet even here certain links are omitted, for we hear of one Matri in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-21.htm" title="When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.">1Samuel 10:21</a>, and Jehiel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm" title="And in Gibeon dwelled the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:">1Chronicles 9:35</a>.<p>------<p>The truth is that in each of the genealogical summaries the transcriber of the original family document left out certain names not needed for his special purpose. The names omitted are not always the same; hence, often in these tables, the apparent discrepancies.<p>Dean Payne Smith, too, suggests, that the hopeless entanglement in the Benjamite genealogies is in a measure due to the terrible civil war which resulted from the crime related in Judges 20. In the confusion which naturally resulted from the massacres and ceaseless wars of this early period, many of the older records of the tribes must have perished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man... whose name was Kish.</span> The genealogy of Saul is rendered obscure by the Hebrew custom of abbreviating such records by the omission of names. The family documents were no doubt kept in full, but when transcribed, as here and in the First Book of Chronicles, only a summary is given, and as the omitted links are not always the same, great difficulty is necessarily the result. The most satisfactory genealogy is that given by Schaff from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35-39</a>, and is as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Benjamin; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Becher; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Aphish, perhaps same as Abiah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Bechorath; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Zeror, or Zur; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> Abiel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> Ner; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> Kish; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> Saul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Very many links, however, are omitted, among whom must be placed Matri, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-21.htm">1 Samuel 10:21</a>; and Jehiel, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a> (and see <span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8:29). He is described as the first settler and coloniser of Gibeon, and as husband of Maachah, a daughter or granddaughter of Caleb. The spelling of his name with an <span class="accented">ain</span> forbids our confounding him with Abiel, as is done by Schaff and most commentators, and whom, apparently, he preceded by many generations. In the two places referred to above a large family of sons is ascribed to him; but as, first of all, the lists do not agree, as, moreover, they are said to dwell with their brethren in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a>), and as Ner, the father of Kish, is mentioned in the second list, it is pretty certain that we are not to regard, them as his actual children, but as the leading names among his posterity. The fearful cruelty recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a> may well account for the hopeless entanglement of Benjamite genealogies. An ancestor of Saul must, of course, have been among the 600 who escaped to the rock Rimmon, but he could have saved only his own life. <span class="cmt_word">A mighty man of power</span>. Really, "of wealth." Saul, like David afterwards, was sprung from an affluent family, whose landed property was situated at Gibeah, about four miles north of Jerusalem, afterwards known as Gibeah of Saul. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 Saul readily went to seek his father's asses. His obedience to his father was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they were now at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Wherever we are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to get wisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to make them up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, in seeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how to secure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consulted and honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how to escape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people would rather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not their money, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it; but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value they put upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times, always to bring a present to those in authority.</body></html>
