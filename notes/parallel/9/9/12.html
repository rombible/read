Some of the maidens of Raman were at the well side, drawing water for their homes. The two strangers accost them with the words, "Is the seer who dwells among you here just now?" and they eagerly reply, "Yes, this very day he came from his house into the town. It is a festival day--you will find him presiding up there," pointing, no doubt, to the high place, where the sacrifices were being offered. Every word spoken by the girls of Ramah, loving to chatter and exhibit their local knowledge and their interest in their great fellow-citizen, the seer and judge, to whom they, in common with the inhabitants of Ramah, were, no doubt, much attached, was remembered in after time by Saul and his companion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-17 The very maid-servants of the city could direct to the prophet.

And we should always be ready to help those who are seeking after God's prophets. Though God had, in displeasure, granted Israel's request for a king, yet he sends them a man to be captain over them, to save them out of the hand of the Philistines. He does it, listening graciously to their cry.</body></html>
