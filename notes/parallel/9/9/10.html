Still, the impression which the narrative leaves on the mind is that it was Samuel's usual residence--"Ramah." We know Samuel had built an altar to the Lord at Ramah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm" title="And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:17</a>); on the day of Saul's arrival there was a great sacrifice taking place on the altar of the high place of the city. Again, in this nameless city the seer had a house of his own (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-18.htm" title="Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.">1Samuel 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-25.htm" title="And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul on the top of the house.">1Samuel 9:25</a>). Samuel, too, was known to Saul's servant as dwelling in this place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 Saul readily went to seek his father's asses. His obedience to his father was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they were now at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Wherever we are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to get wisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to make them up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, in seeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how to secure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consulted and honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how to escape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people would rather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not their money, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it; but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value they put upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times, always to bring a present to those in authority.</body></html>
