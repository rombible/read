Three special words are found in the Divine writings for the inspired messengers or interpreters of the Eternal wilt; of these, the title seer (<span class= "ital">roeh</span>) was the most ancient. It is the title, evidently, by which Samuel in his lifetime was generally known. "Is the seer here?" we read in this passage; and "Where is the seer's house?" and "I am the seer." As time passed on, the term, in the sense of an inspired man of God, became obsolete, and the word <span class= "ital">chozeh, </span>"a gazer." on strange visions, seemed to have been the word used for one inspired. The title <span class= "ital">nabi</span>--prophet--began to come into <span class= "ital">common </span>use in the time of Samuel, to whom the term is not unfrequently applied. The word <span class= "ital">nabi, </span>or prophet, is found in nearly all the Old Testament books, from Genesis to Malachi, though rarely in the earlier writings. This note was inserted by some scribe who lived comparatively later (perhaps in the time of Ezra), but who must have been a reviser of the sacred text of very high authority, as this "note" has come down to us as an integral part of the received Hebrew text. The reason of the insertion is obvious. The title <span class= "ital">roeh--</span>seer--as time passed on, no longer belonged exclusively to "a man of God." The scribe who put in this expression was desirous of pointing out that when Samuel lived it was <span class= "ital">the </span>word always used for a prophet of the Lord. In those early days it had not deteriorated in meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beforetime,</span> etc. This verse is evidently a gloss, written originally by some later hand in the margin, in order to explain the word used for seer in vers. 11, 18, 19. Inserted here in the text it interrupts the narrative, and is itself somewhat incomprehensible. The Septuagint offers a very probable reading, namely, "for the people in old time used to call the prophet a seer," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it was a word used chiefly by the common people. Prophet, <span class="accented">nabi</span>, is really the older and established word from the beginning of the Old Testament to the end. The word <span class="accented">roeh</span>, used in this place for seer, is comparatively rare, as a popular word would be in written compositions. It refers to that which is seen by the ordinary sight, to waking vision (see on 1 Samuel 3:1, 10), whereas the other word for seer, <span class="accented">chozeh</span>, refers to ecstatic vision. <span class="accented">Roeh</span> is used by Isaiah, ch. Isaiah 30:10, apparently in much the same sense as here, of those whom the people consulted in their difficulties, and they might be true prophets as Samuel was, or mere pretenders to occult powers. The present narrative makes it plain that <span class="accented">roeh</span> was used in a good sense in Samuel's days; but gradually it became degraded, and while <span class="accented">chozeh</span> became the respectful word for a prophet, <span class="accented">roeh</span> became the contrary. Another conclusion also follows. We have seen that there are various indications that the Books of Samuel in their present state are later than his days. Here, on the contrary, we have a narrative couched in the very language of his times; for the writer of the gloss contained in this verse was displeased at Samuel being called a <span class="accented">roeh</span>, but did not dare to alter it, though taking care to note that it was equivalent in those days to calling him a <span class="accented">nabi.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 Saul readily went to seek his father's asses. His obedience to his father was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they were now at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Wherever we are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to get wisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to make them up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, in seeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how to secure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consulted and honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how to escape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people would rather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not their money, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it; but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value they put upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times, always to bring a present to those in authority.</body></html>
