he never contemplated fighting in the ranks against Israel, and yet he speaks thus. The generous confidence of the chivalrous Achish is here in painful contrast with the dissimulation of the Israelite chieftain, David.<p>It has been suggested that these suspicions of his loyalty on the part of the Philistine leaders had been aroused by David deliberately, in order to bring about his dismissal from the army in the field. This is possible, for the situation in which David now finds himself was most embarrassing from every point of view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - David's answer is subtle and prevaricating; he pretends that his honour has been attacked, when really he had tricked the unsuspecting Achish. But truth is a modern virtue, and though David extols it in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>), we too often find him practising falsehood. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:6-11 David scarcely ever had a greater deliverance than when dismissed from such insnaring service. God's people should always behave themselves so, as, if possible, to get the good word of all they have dealings with: and it is due to those who have acted well, to speak well of them.</body></html>
