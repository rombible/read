It is hardly the expression we should expect Achish to use of David's followers. All Israelites were, of course, "subjects of Saul," but the term would hardly be used except by one hostile to David, as Nabal was; he once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-10.htm" title="And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.">1Samuel 25:10</a>) made use of an insulting term of a like nature to David. Achish, we know, seemed ever kindly disposed to the outlawed son of Jesse. A probable suggestion has, however, been lately made, that the reference here is to those tribes of Manasseh (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/12-19.htm" title="And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines on advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.">1Chronicles 12:19-21</a>) who had only lately come over to David. Was it not also possible that these very Manassites, who had only very recently deserted the king's cause for David's, were known to some of the Philistines as Saul's soldiers, and that their suspicions had been awakened in the first place by finding them marching under David's standard in the division of Gath?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With thy master's servants</span>. It has been well remarked that while this would be a strange description of David's own men, it would exactly describe that band of deserters belonging to the tribe of Manasseh who, instead of obeying Saul's summons to the war with the Philistines, joined David about this time (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As soon as ye be up early in the morning,</span> etc. If it was on the second day s march that the Philistine lords objected to David's continuance with them, he would be back at Gath in two days, and on the third day reach Ziklag, as is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>. However difficult David's position may have been, still every one must condemn his conduct towards Achish as dishonourable; but God, who often deals with men more mercifully than they deserve, nevertheless rescued him from his state of perplexity, and saved him from the necessity of either fighting against his own countrymen or of still more dishonourably breaking his word to Achish by deserting in the battle. He also sent him home just in time to rescue from a miserable fate those whom he loved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:6-11 David scarcely ever had a greater deliverance than when dismissed from such insnaring service. God's people should always behave themselves so, as, if possible, to get the good word of all they have dealings with: and it is due to those who have acted well, to speak well of them.</body></html>
