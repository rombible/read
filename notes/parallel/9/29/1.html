It signifies a fort or a strong place. This Aphek was most likely situated in the Plain of Jezreel. Eusebius places it in the neighbourhood of En-dor.<p><span class= "bld">By a fountain which is in Jezreel.</span>--"By a fountain." The LXX. wrongly adds "dor," supposing the spring or fountain to be the well-known En-dor--spring of Dor--but En-dor, we know, lay many miles away from the camp of Saul. This "fountain" has been identified by modern travellers as <span class= "ital">Ain-Jal-d, </span>the Fountain of Goliath, because it was traditionally regarded as the scene of the old combat with the giant. It is a large spring which flows from under the cavern in the rock which forms the base of Gilboa. "There is every reason to regard this as the ancient fountain of Jezreel, where Saul and Jonathan pitched before their last fatal battle, and where, too, in the days of the Crusades, Saladin and the Christians successively encamped."--Robinson, <span class= "ital">Palestine, </span>3:167, 8.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistines gathered,</span> etc. The narrative, broken off for the description of Saul's abasement, is again resumed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-1.htm">1 Samuel 28:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Aphek</span>. As we saw on 1 Samuel 4:1, this word, signifying a <span class="accented">fortress</span>, is a very common name for places. If it was the Aphek in Judah there mentioned, David's dismissal would have taken place near Gath, and so soon after Achish joined the Philistine army. Mr. Conder thinks it was the place represented by the modern village <span class="accented">Fuku'a</span>, near Mount Gilboa, in the tribe of Issachar; but as this was distant from Ziklag eighty or ninety miles, it would not have been possible for David to have reached home thence on the third day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), nor was it probable that his presence with his little army would remain long unnoticed. <span class="cmt_word">A fountain which is in Jezreel.</span> Hebrew, "the fountain." Conder says, "Crossing the valley we see before us the site of Jezreel, on a knoll 500 feet high. The position is very peculiar, for whilst on the north and northeast the slopes are steep and rugged, on the south the ascent is very gradual, and the traveller coming northward is astonished to look down suddenly on the valley with its two springs: one, 'Ain Jalud, welling out from a conglomerate cliff, and forming a pool 100 yards long with muddy borders; the other, the Crusaders' fountain of Tubania" ('Tent-Work,' 1:124). The former is the fountain mentioned here; and it is evident that even now Saul had chosen a strong position for his army. The reading of the Septuagint, <span class="accented">En-dor</span> instead of "the fountain" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">En</span>, or <span class="accented">Ain</span>), is indefensible, as the Israelites were many miles to the southward. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-5 David waited with a secret hope that the Lord would help him out of his difficulty. But he seems to have been influenced too much by the fear of man, in consenting to attend Achish. It is hard to come near to the brink of sin, and not to fall in. God inclined the princes of the Philistines to oppose David's being employed in the battle. Thus their dislike befriended him, when no friend could do him such a kindness.</body></html>
