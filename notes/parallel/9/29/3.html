The versions have translated it in various ways. The English Version here is literal. The Syrlac singularly renders, "this time, and time, and months."

But he seems to have been influenced too much by the fear of man, in consenting to attend Achish. It is hard to come near to the brink of sin, and not to fall in. God inclined the princes of the Philistines to oppose David's being employed in the battle. Thus their dislike befriended him, when no friend could do him such a kindness.</body></html>
