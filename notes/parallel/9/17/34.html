Fierce wild animals, the terror of the Hebrew shepherds, had attacked his flock: these he had met and slain, almost without arms. <span class= "ital">Another </span>had helped him when he did his brave duty <span class= "ital">then; </span>and he felt that the same invisible Guardian would give him nerve and strength <span class= "ital">now </span>in this more dangerous encounter. Only let him try. There was nothing to fear; he <span class= "ital">must </span>succeed, he and his Divine Helper!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-36.</span> - David does not appeal to any feat of arms. He may have served with credit in repelling some Philistine foray, but these combats with wild beasts, fought without the presence of spectators, and with no regent necessity (as most shepherds would have been too glad to compound with such enemies by letting them take a lamb without molestation), still more clearly proved David's fearless nature. Lions and bears were both common in ancient times in Palestine, when the country was more densely covered with wood; and bears are numerous in the mountainous districts now. Lions seem to have been less feared than bears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>); but Canon Tristram thinks there were two species of the lion in Palestine - one short-maned, which was not very formidable, the other long maned, which was more fierce and dangerous ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 117). The Hebrew literally is, "There came the lion and even the bear," the articles implying that they were the well known foes of the shepherd. The written text has <span class="accented">zeh</span>, "this," for <span class="accented">seh</span>, "a lamb," probably a mere variety of spelling. There can be little doubt that David refers to two different occasions, especially as bears and lions never hunt in company. <span class="cmt_word">By his beard.</span> Neither the bear nor the lion has a beard, and the word really means "the chin," "the place where the beard grows." The Chaldee translates <span class="accented">the lower jaw</span>, and the Septuagint <span class="accented">the throat.</span> It is plain from this description that David slew the beast with his staff. <span class="cmt_word">He arose against me.</span> This shows that the combat thus particularly described was with the bear, which does thus rise on its hind legs to grapple with its foe, while the lion crouches and then springs. Pliny also says that the weakest part of a bear is its head, and that it can be killed by a smart blow there. The manner in which David killed the lion is not described. <span class="cmt_word">Defied</span>. See on ver. 10. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:31-39 A shepherd lad, come the same morning from keeping sheep, had more courage than all the mighty men of Israel. Thus God often sends good words to his Israel, and does great things for them, by the weak and foolish things of the world. As he had answered his brother's passion with meekness, so David answered Saul's fear with faith. When David kept sheep, he proved himself very careful and tender of his flock. This reminds us of Christ, the good Shepherd, who not only ventured, but laid down his life for the sheep. Our experience ought to encourage us to trust in God, and be bold in the way of duty. He that has delivered, does and will continue to do so. David gained leave to fight the Philistine. Not being used to such armour as Saul put upon him, he was not satisfied to go in that manner; this was from the Lord, that it might more plainly appear he fought and conquered in faith, and that the victory was from Him who works by the feeblest and most despised means and instruments. It is not to be inquired how excellent any thing is, but how proper. Let Saul's coat be ever so rich, and his armour ever so strong, what is David the better if they fit him not? But faith, prayer, truth, and righteousness; the whole armour of God, and the mind that was in Christ; are equally needful for all the servants of the Lord, whatever may be their work.</body></html>
