There--that is, within the fortified enclosure--he left (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-22.htm" title="And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.">1Samuel 17:22</a>) his baggage, the ten cheeses, &c, and hastened to the "front," where he knew his brethren and the men of Judah would be posted. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-14.htm" title="In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.">Numbers 10:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He came to the trench.</span> More probably the barricade, or outer circle of defence for their camp, made of their wagons (see on ch. 10:22). Strictly the word means a <span class="accented">wagon track</span>, but the primary meaning of the verb is <span class="accented">to be round.</span> This was the shape of camps in old time, and they were protected against surprise by having the wagons and baggage placed round them. The word occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-5.htm">1 Samuel 26:5, 7</a>. The latter part of the verse is literally, "And he came to the circle of the wagons, and to the host that was going forth to the array; and they shouted for the battle." If the article be omitted before "going forth," for which there is some authority, the rendering of the A.V. would be right. <span class="cmt_word">David left his carriage.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> that which he was carrying. The word is rendered <span class="accented">stuff</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>.

In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.</body></html>
