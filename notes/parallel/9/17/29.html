The Hebrew here would be more literally rendered, "Is it not a word," or "It was only a word," thus deprecating his elder brother's anger. "What have I done? It was but a mere word. I was only speaking with holy anger about this impious challenge of the Philistine; nothing more." The ancient versions thus understand this clause.<p>If we render as the Authorised Version, then the sense is quite clear. "You seem bitterly displeased with my zeal in this matter, but surely, is there not a good cause for my passionate emotion here--such an insult to our God?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:12-30 Jesse little thought of sending his son to the army at that critical juncture; but the wise God orders actions and affairs, so as to serve his designs. In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.</body></html>
