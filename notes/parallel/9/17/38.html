The word rendered "his armour" literally signifies <span class= "ital">his garments, </span>that is, the dress worn beneath the mail. Upon this was buckled on the heavy metal armour suit, with the great fighting sword and the royal helm. It is not necessary to suppose David was at all of the same proportions as Saul, for much of the dress could have been speedily adjusted to the requirements of one slighter and shorter than the king; besides, the result shows they were, in spite of alteration, far too heavy and cumbersome. <span class= "ital">"</span>I cannot go with these," simply said the brave boy, his purpose, however, of meeting the Philistine giant quite unshaken, though he found his comparatively weak person unable to bear the weight of the king's panoply or to wield his arms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul armed David with his armour.</span> Rather, "Saul clad David in his war dress." The word does not mean <span class="accented">arms</span>, either offensive or defensive; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>, where it is rendered "clothes," we read of its being rent. It occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>, and is there rendered "garments." Strictly it was the soldier's coat, worn under his armour, and girt close to the body by the sword belt. It does not follow that David was as tall as Saul because he thus put on his military coat; for it would be adjusted to the body by the belt, and its length was not a matter of much consequence. When, then, it is said that <span class="cmt_word">David girded his sword upon his armour,</span> it means upon this coat, though the corselet of mail would also be worn over it. He assayed to go. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he made an attempt at going, took a short walk thus arrayed, making trial all the while of his equipments; and he found them so cumbrous that he felt that he would have no chance against the Philistine except as a light-armed soldier. The agility of his movements would then make him a match for one so heavily overweighted as Goliath. Wearing, therefore, only his shepherd's dress, armed only with a sling, David descended into the ravine which separated the two armies, chose there five pebbles, and, clambering up the other side, advanced towards the Philistine. For <span class="cmt_word">brook</span> the Hebrew has "torrent bed." Condor speaks of a torrent flowing through the ravine (see on ver. 2). COMBAT OF DAVID AND GOLIATH (vers. 41-54). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:31-39 A shepherd lad, come the same morning from keeping sheep, had more courage than all the mighty men of Israel. Thus God often sends good words to his Israel, and does great things for them, by the weak and foolish things of the world. As he had answered his brother's passion with meekness, so David answered Saul's fear with faith. When David kept sheep, he proved himself very careful and tender of his flock. This reminds us of Christ, the good Shepherd, who not only ventured, but laid down his life for the sheep. Our experience ought to encourage us to trust in God, and be bold in the way of duty. He that has delivered, does and will continue to do so. David gained leave to fight the Philistine. Not being used to such armour as Saul put upon him, he was not satisfied to go in that manner; this was from the Lord, that it might more plainly appear he fought and conquered in faith, and that the victory was from Him who works by the feeblest and most despised means and instruments. It is not to be inquired how excellent any thing is, but how proper. Let Saul's coat be ever so rich, and his armour ever so strong, what is David the better if they fit him not? But faith, prayer, truth, and righteousness; the whole armour of God, and the mind that was in Christ; are equally needful for all the servants of the Lord, whatever may be their work.</body></html>
