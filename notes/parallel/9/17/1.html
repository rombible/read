The compiler of the book is henceforth mainly concerned with the story of David, and how he gradually rose in popular estimation. The history does not profess to give anything like a consecutive account of the reign and wars of Saul. It was evidently compiled from documents of the time, but put into its present shape long afterwards. "Probably," writes Dean Payne Smith, "at each prophetic school there would be stored up copies of Psalms written for their religious services, ballads such as those in the Book of Jashar, and in the book of the wars of the Lord, narratives of stirring events like this before us, and histories both of their own chiefs, such as was Samuel (the original founder of these famous educational centres), and afterwards Elijah and Elisha, and also of their kings."<p><span class= "bld">Pitched between Shochoh and Azekah.</span>--The locality was some twelve or fifteen miles southwest of Jerusalem, and nine or ten from Bethlehem, the home of the family of Jesse. The name Ephes-dammim, the "boundary of blood," is suggestive, and tells of the constant border warfare which took place in this neighbourhood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistines gathered together their armies.</span> As the object of the historian is not to give us an account of the Philistine wars, but only to record the manner of David's ripening for the kingly office, nothing is said as to the space of time which had elapsed between Saul's victory at Michmash and the present invasion. We are, however, briefly told that "there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>), and apparently this inroad took place very many years after Saul's establishment upon the throne. The Philistine camp was at <span class="cmt_word">Ephes-dammim</span>, called Pas-dammim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm">1 Chronicles 11:13</a>. The best explanation of the word gives as its meaning <span class="accented">the boundary of blood</span>, so called from the continual fighting which took place there upon the borders. <span class="cmt_word">Shochoh</span>, spelt more correctly <span class="accented">Socoh</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>, was one of fourteen villages enumerated there as lying in the Shephelah, described by Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:156) as a region of "low hills of limestone, frowning a distinct district between the plain and the watershed mountains." In this district Socoh lay northeast of Eleutheropolis (Beth-jibrin), midway between it and Beth-shemesh, from each of which places it was distant about eight or nine miles. It is now called <span class="accented">Shuweikeh.</span> For <span class="cmt_word">Azekah</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-11 Men so entirely depend upon God in all things, that when he withdraws his help, the most valiant and resolute cannot find their hearts or hands, as daily experience shows.</body></html>
