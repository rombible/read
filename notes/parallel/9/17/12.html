And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.">1Samuel 17:55-58</a>, in the Vatican LXX. This omission was, no doubt, owing to the difficulty connected with this mention of David, where he is apparently introduced for the first time into the history; the LXX. translation not un-frequently adding or subtracting from the text when anything met them which they could not readily understand. The passage, as we find it, is undoubtedly genuine; the probable explanation of what puzzled the LXX. is given below.<p>It is, however, better (with the Syriac Version) to place all the words after "Beth-lehem-judah" down to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-14.htm" title="And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.">1Samuel 17:14</a> in a parenthesis. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-15.htm" title="But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.">1Samuel 17:15</a>, after the parenthesis descriptive of Jesse and his three elder sons, takes up the account of David again, thus: "But David went," &c.<p><span class= "bld">Went among men for an old man.</span>--This rendering follows the translation of Jerome's Vulgate, "Senex et grandaevus inter viros," rather than the Hebrew. The literal translation of <span class= "ital">ba-ba?nashim </span>would be <span class= "ital">went among men. </span>It is best to assume that the verb <span class= "ital">ba- </span>here is used elliptically for <span class= "ital">ba-bayamin, </span>"was advanced in days," that is, "was an old man." Keil renders <span class= "ital">baanashim </span>"among the weak," that is, "Jesse had come to be reckoned among the weak" (or the aged). Maurer and others believe the present Hebrew reading corrupt; the sense, however, is clear.<p>Jesse is represented in this parenthesis, descriptive of the father of David, for some reason known only to the compiler, as already an old man. Possibly this notice is inserted to explain the reason why the father of the future hero-king of Israel was not among the warriors of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesse... went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.</span> This translation is taken from the Vulgate; but the Hebrew is, "And the man in the days of Saul was old, gone among men." Some explain this as meaning "placed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "reckoned among men of rank;" but probably an aleph has dropped out in the word rendered men, and we should read <span class="accented">"gone," i.e.</span> "advanced in years." Old is used in a very indefinite way in the Books of Samuel; but as Jesse had eight sons, of whom the youngest was now grown up, he must have been nearly sixty. <span class="cmt_word">Went and followed.</span> Hebrew, "And there went the three elder sons of Jesse went after Saul to the war." Some grammarians consider that this repetition of the verb is intended to give it the force of a pluperfect, - they had gone,-but it is more probably an error, and one of the two verbs should be omitted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:12-30 Jesse little thought of sending his son to the army at that critical juncture; but the wise God orders actions and affairs, so as to serve his designs. In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.</body></html>
