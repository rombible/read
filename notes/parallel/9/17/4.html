for the cubit is sixteen inches, and the span (really the hand-breadth) is five and one-third inches. A span, <span class="accented">sit</span>, is eight inches, but the word used here is <span class="accented">zereth.</span> See on these measures, Conder, 'Handbook,' p. 79. This height, though very great, has been attained to in modern times. <span class="cmt_word">Armed with a coat of mail.</span> Literally, "clothed in a shirt of scales," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a corselet made of metal scales sewn on cloth so as to overlap one another. It was flexible, and protected the back and sides as well as the kent. <span class="cmt_word">Five thousand shekels of brass.</span> Really copper, as brass was then unknown. Conder gives the shekel as equal to two-thirds of an ounce. This would make the corselet weigh at least two hundred weight, an enormous load to carry even for a short time. Goliath's other equipments correspond in heaviness, and largely exceed the weight of medieval suits of armour. <span class="cmt_word">Greaves of brass upon his legs.</span> The thighs were protected by the corselet, so that only the legs required defensive armour. This would account for the weight of the corselet, as it was much longer than the cuirass, as worn by the Greeks and Romans. <span class="cmt_word">A target.</span> Really, "a javelin." It was carried at the back, ready to be taken in the hand and thrown at the enemy when required. The versions have a different reading - <span class="accented">magan</span>, shield, for <span class="accented">chidon</span>, javelin. The shield was carried before him by an armour bearer. <span class="cmt_word">The staff.</span> The written text has a word which usually signifies <span class="accented">shaft, arrow</span>, for which the Kri substitutes <span class="accented">wood</span>, the noun actually found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>; but most probably the word used here is an archaic name for the handle or staff of a spear. <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred shekels.</span> The weight of the iron head of the spear would be about twenty-five pounds. However tall and strong Goliath may have been, yet with all this vast weight of metal his movements must have been slow and unready. He was got up, in bet, more to tell upon the imagination than for real fighting, and though, like a castle, he might have been invincible if attacked with sword and spear, he was much too encumbered with defensive armour to be capable of assuming the offensive against a light armed enemy. To David belongs the credit of seeing that the Philistine champion was a huge imposition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-11 Men so entirely depend upon God in all things, that when he withdraws his help, the most valiant and resolute cannot find their hearts or hands, as daily experience shows.</body></html>
