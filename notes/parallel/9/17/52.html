</span>there is no article in the Hebrew.

The LXX. render, instead of "to a valley," "to Gath." These Greek translators probably then had before them the true text: <span class= "ital">Gath, </span>instead of <span class= "ital">gai, </span>a valley. <span class= "ital">Gath </span>is mentioned in the next sentence.<p><span class= "bld">The way to Shaaraim.</span>--This was a town in the lowlands of Judah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-36.htm" title="And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:36</a>); the name has probably been preserved in the modern Kefr Zakariya. The LXX., however," do not understand Shaaraim as a city at all, but render, instead of "by the way to Shaaraim," "in the way of the gates." The "gates" of Ekron are mentioned as one of the notable places of the flight in the preceding sentence.<p>If the LXX. interpretation be adopted, we must understand by this expression the space between the outer and the inner gates of Ekron.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 52, 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the valley.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">gai.</span> As we have seen, there was a <span class="accented">gai</span> or ravine between the two armies, but in the Hebrew there is no article, and the Israelites must also cross this before any fighting began. The panic which struck the Philistines when they saw their champion fall enabled the Israelites to do so, but the pursuit only then commenced. The Septuagint reads Gath, a very probable emendation, for, as we saw in the passage quoted from Condor on ver. 2, Gath was situated at the mouth of the terebinth valley. The Syriac and Vulgate retain <span class="accented">valley</span>, but the former understands it of the mouth of the valley of Elah. <span class="cmt_word">Shaaraim</span> was a town assigned to Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>) in the Shephelah (see on ver. 1), but was now held by the Philistines. <span class="cmt_word">They spoiled their tents.</span> More correctly, <span class="accented">"their</span> camp." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:48-58 See how frail and uncertain life is, even when a man thinks himself best fortified; how quickly, how easily, and by how small a matter, the passage may be opened for life to go out, and death to enter! Let not the strong man glory in his strength, nor the armed man in his armour. God resists the proud, and pours contempt on those who defy him and his people. No one ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. The history is recorded, that all may exert themselves for the honour of God, and the support of his cause, with bold and unshaken reliance on him. There is one conflict in which all the followers of the Lamb are, and must be engaged; one enemy, more formidable than Goliath, still challenges the armies of Israel. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Go forth to battle with the faith of David, and the powers of darkness shall not stand against you. But how often is the Christian foiled through an evil heart of unbelief!</body></html>
