Had his heart for one instant failed him--as, indeed, it well might; had he not possessed a confidence which nothing could shake in an unseen Helper--or had his skill as a marksman failed him in the slightest degree, the Philistine with one blow would have laid David lifeless at his feet; or had the active shepherd boy eluded his giant antagonist, it must have been by flight. In any case, the single combat upon which Israel had staked so much would have gone against the chosen people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50, 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone.</span> It is evident that the narrator regarded David's victory as extraordinary; and no doubt it required not only great courage, but also perfect skill, as only the lower portion of the forehead would be exposed, and on no other part of the giant's body would a blow have been of any avail. The narrator also calls attention to the fact that David relied upon his sling alone, for <span class="cmt_word">there was no sword in the hand of David.</span> Slings probably were regarded as useful only to harass an enemy, while swords, which they had only lately been able to procure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a>), were regarded as the real weapons of offence. David, therefore, completes his victory by killing Goliath with his own sword as he lay stunned upon the ground. As Ahimelech considered it fit for David's own use (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>), it was probably not so monstrous in size as Goliath's other weapons. <span class="cmt_word">Champion</span> is not the word so rendered in vers. 4, 23, but that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a> for "a <span class="accented">hero</span> of valour." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:48-58 See how frail and uncertain life is, even when a man thinks himself best fortified; how quickly, how easily, and by how small a matter, the passage may be opened for life to go out, and death to enter! Let not the strong man glory in his strength, nor the armed man in his armour. God resists the proud, and pours contempt on those who defy him and his people. No one ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. The history is recorded, that all may exert themselves for the honour of God, and the support of his cause, with bold and unshaken reliance on him. There is one conflict in which all the followers of the Lamb are, and must be engaged; one enemy, more formidable than Goliath, still challenges the armies of Israel. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Go forth to battle with the faith of David, and the powers of darkness shall not stand against you. But how often is the Christian foiled through an evil heart of unbelief!</body></html>
