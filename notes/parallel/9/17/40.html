nor was the issue of the combat, now he had resolved to use the sling, even doubtful. It has been well said he was like one armed with a rifle, while his enemy had only a spear and a sword, and if only he could take sure aim the result was absolutely certain.<p>Wordsworth, again, on the words "chose him five smooth stones out of the brook," refers to Augustine's Commentary, who finds here a deep mystical signification. It is an admirable specimen of the Patristic School of Exposition, which, although quaint, and not unfrequently "far-fetched," will always, and with good reason, possess great power over the minds of the earnest and devout student. "So our Divine David, the Good Shepherd of Bethlehem, when He went forth at the temptation to meet Satan--our ghostly Goliath--chose <span class= "ital">five stones </span>out of the brook. He took the five books of Moses out of the flowing stream of Judaism. He took what was solid out of what was fluid. He took what was permanent out of what was transitory. He took what was moral and perpetual out of what was ceremonial and temporary. He took stones out of a brook, and with one of these He overthrew Satan. All Christ's answers to the tempter are <span class= "ital">moral </span>precepts, taken from <span class= "ital">one </span>Book of the Law (Deuteronomy), and He prefaced His replies with the same words, '<span class= "ital">It is written;' </span>and with this sling and stone of Scripture He laid our Goliath low, and He has taught us by His example how we may also vanquish the tempter." (See St. Augustine, Sermon 32)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:40-47 The security and presumption of fools destroy them. Nothing can excel the humility, faith, and piety which appear in David's words. He expressed his assured expectation of success; he gloried in his mean appearance and arms, that the victory might be ascribed to the Lord alone.</body></html>
