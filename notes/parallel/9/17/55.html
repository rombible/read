It is briefly this. In the preceding chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-18.htm" title="And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.">1Samuel 17:18-23</a>), David, the son of Jesse, is chosen to play before the mentally sick king; his playing relieved the sufferer, who became attached to the young musician, and in consequence appointed him to a position about his person that certainly would have involved a lengthened, if not a continuous, residence at the court. In this and the following verses we read how this same David, at the time of his great exploit, was apparently unknown to the king and to Abner, the captain of the host. The LXX., fully conscious of the difficulty, determined to solve it by boldly, if not wisely, cutting the knot. They literally expunged from their version all the later passages which they could not easily bring into harmony with the earlier. The Greek Version, then, simply omits these four last verses of 1 Samuel 17, together with the first five verses of 1 Samuel 18, and the whole of the section <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-12.htm" title="Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.">1Samuel 17:12-31</a>.<p>Various ingenious explanations have been suggested by scholars.<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>) The mental state of Saul when David played before him was such that the king failed to recognise him on the present occasion, and Abner probably had never seen him before.<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) Some length of time had elapsed since his last visit to the court, and as he was then in very early manhood, he had, so to speak, grown, in a comparatively speaking short space of time, out of Saul's memory.<p>(c) The purpose of Saul's inquiry was <span class= "ital">not </span>to find out who David was--that he knew well already--but to ascertain the position and general circumstances of the young hero's father, as, according to the promise (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.">1Samuel 17:25</a>), in the event of his success (which evidently the king confidently looked for), the father of the champion and his family would receive extraordinary honours.<p>The real solution of the difficulty probably lies in the fact that, as has been before stated, this and the other historical books of the Old Testament were made up by the inspired compiler from well-authenticated traditions current in Israel, and most probably preserved in the archives of the great prophetic schools. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.">1Samuel 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-15.htm" title="But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.">1Samuel 17:15</a>.) There were, no doubt, many of these traditions connected with the principal events of David's early career. Two here were selected which, to a certain extent, <span class= "ital">covered the same ground. </span>The first--preserved, no doubt, in some prophetic school where music and poetry were especially cultivated--narrates the influence which David acquired over Saul through his great gift of music. The power of music and poetry in Saul's mental disease was evidently the great point of interest to the original writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/16-14.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.">1Samuel 16:14-23</a>. Now, in the narrative contained in these ten verses <span class= "ital">no note of time </span>occurs. The events related evidently were spread over a considerable, possibly over a very long, period. The afflicted king might have seen the young musician perhaps in a darkened tent once or twice before the Goliath combat, but the great intimacy described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/16-21.htm" title="And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.">1Samuel 16:21-23</a>, we may well assume, belonged to a period subsequent to the memorable combat with the giant.<p>Following out this hypothesis, we may with some confidence assume that King Saul failed entirely to recognise the young player whom he had only seen (possibly only heard in his darkened tent) on one or two sad occasions; and Abner probably had never seen him.<p>As for the great love on the part of the king, and position of royal armour-bearer these things we have little doubt came to David <span class= "ital">after </span>the victory over the giant Philistine, and very likely indeed in consequence of it.<p>In the <span class= "ital">later </span>of the two sections of the Goliath history, the compiler cared little for the musical detail; his work was to show that the foundation stone of David's brilliant and successful life was intense faith in the Jehovah of Israel, a perfect child-like trust in the power of the Invisible King.<p>In the <span class= "ital">former </span>of the two sections the relater--no doubt in his day a famous teacher in some school of prophetic music--was, only concerned to show the mighty influence of his Divine art upon the souls and the lives of men, as exemplified in the story of the early days of the sweet Psalmist-King of Israel.<p>The musical details connected with the early life of David, the composer of so many of the famous hymns sung in the Tempie Service and also in the public gatherings of the people, would be--in the eyes of this writer--of the deepest interest to coming generations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 55-58.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner, whose son is this youth?</span> Hebrew, "lad," <span class="accented">na'ar.</span> We have seen that the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21-23</a> carries the history of David's relations with Saul down to a much later period, and that in ver. 15 of this chapter David is represented as not dwelling continuously at Saul's court, but as having returned to Bethlehem and resumed his pastoral occupations there, whence he would be summoned back in case of the recurrence of Saul's malady. It is plain from what is stated here that David had not thus far spent time enough at Gibeah to be personally well known either to Saul or his officers (see note on ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Stripling</span>. Not <span class="accented">na'ar</span>, but <span class="accented">alem</span>, the masculine of the word <span class="accented">almah</span>, used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>. It means a young man fully grown, and arrived at the age to marry, and so is more definite than <span class="accented">na'ar</span>, which Saul uses in ver. 58. <span class="cmt_word">As David returned,</span> etc. Abner, as captain of the host, would naturally watch the combat, and as soon as it was possible would bring the young warrior into the king's presence. But what is recorded here could have taken place only after the pursuit of the Philistines was over, and really these five verses should be united with ch. 17, as their object is to introduce the account of the love. of Jonathan for David. Starting then with the inquiry made by the king of Abner, asking for fuller information as to the young man's parentage, the historian then tells how after the chase he was brought before Saul, and then, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1</a>, that the result of their conversation was the warm love that henceforward knit together these two kindred souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:48-58 See how frail and uncertain life is, even when a man thinks himself best fortified; how quickly, how easily, and by how small a matter, the passage may be opened for life to go out, and death to enter! Let not the strong man glory in his strength, nor the armed man in his armour. God resists the proud, and pours contempt on those who defy him and his people. No one ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. The history is recorded, that all may exert themselves for the honour of God, and the support of his cause, with bold and unshaken reliance on him. There is one conflict in which all the followers of the Lamb are, and must be engaged; one enemy, more formidable than Goliath, still challenges the armies of Israel. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Go forth to battle with the faith of David, and the powers of darkness shall not stand against you. But how often is the Christian foiled through an evil heart of unbelief!</body></html>
