He looked on such manifestations of bitter hatred as simple outbursts of a temporary insanity. His loyal nature would not believe in the enduring hate of one so great and noble as Saul; but we read here that even when the king recovered from the paroxysm, he <span class= "ital">feared </span>David. Saul was conscious that his old vigour and ability were deserting him, and in David he recognised the presence of a power he knew had once been his. Not being able, even in his sane hours, to endure the presence of one whom he too surely felt would sooner or later take his place, the king dismissed him honourably from the Court, and invested him with an important military charge. Perhaps already the dark thought which some time later (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm" title="And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.">1Samuel 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-25.htm" title="And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.">1Samuel 18:25</a>) influenced the king had entered into his unhappy mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul was afraid of David.</span> new feeling. To his jealousy succeeded a sense of powerlessness, as knowing that a higher power was with David, while he had lost the Divine protection. This miserable feeling grew upon the unhappy king, till before the battle of Gilboa we find him with all his old heroic spirit gone, a miserable wreck, seeking for comfort at the hands of a woman of the most worthless kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-5.htm">1 Samuel 28:5, 7, 20</a>). In this despondent state of mind he dismisses David from attendance upon him, but in an honourable manner, giving him the command of a thousand men, at the head of whom <span class="cmt_word">he went out and came in before the people,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a public capacity, as an officer of state. As Saul seems entirely to have neglected the internal administration of the kingdom, this would refer to military expeditions (see on ver. 5); and in these <span class="cmt_word">David behaved himself wisely.</span> Rather, "prospered" (see on ver. 5). His great success only increased Saul's fears; but both <span class="cmt_word">Israel and Judah loved David,</span> now that in this higher command they had full opportunities for judging of his high qualities. Thus again his removal from his place in Saul's bodyguard only served to make him better known. The separate mention of Israel and Judah is an indication of the Books of Samuel having been written at a post-Solomonic date, though the distinction was a very old one (see on 1 Samuel 11:8). SAUL, UNDER PRETENCE OF A MARRIAGE WITH HIS DAUGHTER, PLOTS DAVID'S DEATH (vers. 17-30). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:12-30 For a long time David was kept in continual apprehension of falling by the hand of Saul, yet he persevered in meek and respectful behaviour towards his persecutor. How uncommon is such prudence and discretion, especially under insults and provocations! Let us inquire if we imitate this part of the exemplary character before us. Are we behaving wisely in all our ways? Is there no sinful omission, no rashness of spirit, nothing wrong in our conduct? Opposition and perverseness in others, will not excuse wrong tempers in us, but should increase our care, and attention to the duties of our station. Consider Him that endured contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds, Heb 12:3. If David magnified the honour of being son-in-law to king Saul, how should we magnify the honour of being sons to the King of kings!</body></html>
