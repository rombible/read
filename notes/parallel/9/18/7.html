It was this alternate singing which led to the psalms being composed in parallel sentences, and not in metre; and we from the temple service have inherited our method of chanting antiphonally. <span class="cmt_word">As they played.</span> The word is ambiguous, and to an English reader would suggest the idea of the women playing upon the musical instruments. It usually refers to merriment, and so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-5.htm">Zechariah 8:5</a> it is used of the children <span class="accented">playing</span> in the streets, but especially it refers to dancing. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-14.htm">2 Samuel 2:14</a> it is used of a war dance ending in a real conflict; and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>) of David dancing to instruments of music, before the ark. Michal probably would not have despised David for playing an instrument of music during a religious ceremony; it was the posturing of the dance which seemed to her beneath the dignity of a king. So these women danced in alternate choruses to the beating of their tambourines and triangles. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>, where, however, it is in a different conjugation, the verb is translated "to make sport." Really Samson was compelled to dance Israel's national war dance before the Philistines. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:6-11 David's troubles not only immediately follow his triumphs, but arise from them; such is the vanity of that which seems greatest in this world. It is a sign that the Spirit of God is departed from men, if, like Saul, they are peevish, envious, suspicious, and ill-natured. Compare David, with his harp in his hand, aiming to serve Saul, and Saul, with his javelin in his hand, aiming to slay David; and observe the sweetness and usefulness of God's persecuted people, and the barbarity of their persecutors. But David's safety must be ascribed to God's providence.</body></html>
