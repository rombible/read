Thus in two ways, first as a musician, and now as a soldier, David was forced into those intimate relations with Saul, which ended so tragically. For a while, however, those happier results ensued summed up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan and David made a covenant.</span> We are not to suppose that this happened immediately. David continued on friendly terms with Saul for a considerable period, during which he went on many expeditions, and grew in military renown (see ver. 5). And thus the love which began with admiration of David's prowess grew deeper and more confirmed by constant intercourse, till this solemn bond of mutual friendship was entered into by the two youthful heroes, by which they bound themselves under all circumstances to be true and faithful to one another. How nobly Jonathan kept the bond the history proceeds immediately to tell us; nor was David subsequently unmindful of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>:l, 7). <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan stripped himself of the robe,</span> etc. In confirmation of the bond Jonathan gave David first his <span class="accented">robe</span>, the <span class="accented">meil</span>, which, as we have seen on 1 Samuel 2:19, was the ordinary dress of the wealthier classes; and next <span class="cmt_word">his garments,</span> his military dress (see on 1 Samuel 17:38, 39), worn over the <span class="accented">meil</span>, and which here seems to include his accoutrements, - the bow, sword, and girdle, - though elsewhere distinguished from them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>). In thus clothing David in his own princely equipments Jonathan was showing his friend the greatest personal honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8</a>), and such a gift is still highly esteemed in the East. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-5 The friendship of David and Jonathan was the effect of Divine grace, which produces in true believers one heart and one soul, and causes them to love each other. This union of souls is from partaking in the Spirit of Christ. Where God unites hearts, carnal matters are too weak to separate them. Those who love Christ as their own souls, will be willing to join themselves to him in an everlasting covenant. It was certainly a great proof of the power of God's grace in David, that he was able to bear all this respect and honour, without being lifted up above measure.</body></html>
