Evidently a series of victories after the fall of the dreaded champion--perhaps spread over a very considerable period--had for a time restored the supremacy of Israel in Canaan. In this war, David, on whom after his great feat of arms the eyes of all the soldiery were fixed, established his character for bravery and skill.<p><span class= "bld">Singing and dancing.</span>--This was on some grand occasion--probably the final triumph at the end of the war. The <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary, </span>on the English rendering "singing and dancing," remarks that "the Hebrew text is probably here corrupt, and suggests that for <span class= "ital">vau, '</span>and,' we ought to read <span class= "ital">beth, '</span>with' and that then the sense would be to sing 'in the dance,' or 'with dancing.' The action was for the women to dance to the sound of the timbrel, and to sing the Epinicium with strophe and antistrophe as they danced and played." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm" title="And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.">Judges 11:34</a>.)<p>We know that music and song were originally closely connected with dancing. David, for instance, when a mighty king, on one great occasion in Jerusalem actually himself performed dances before all the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2Samuel 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2Samuel 6:16</a>). (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine.</span> Or more probably, as in the margin, "of the Philistines." The allusion is not to the combat with Goliath, but to one of the expeditions referred to in ver. 5, in which David had gained some decisive victory. The women would not have described the slaughter of one champion as the slaying of ten thousand, nor would there have been any contrast between this act and the military enterprises of Saul. Probably he too would have looked with indifference upon this Oriental exaggeration of the daring bravery of a boy; but what galled him was David's continual success in repeated campaigns. <span class="cmt_word">The Philistine</span> means the whole people of that name; and as the war between them and Saul lasted all the days of Saul's life, and was his main kingly work, he saw with envy the rapid growth of David's reputation; and when, after some noble achievement, the women gave David an ovation, and declared in their songs that he had achieved a success ten times as great as Saul, an outburst of ill feeling was the result. Saul suddenly became aware that the young captain on whose shoulders he had devolved the chief labours of the war had supplanted him in the popular estimation, and hatred took the place of the good feeling which he had previously entertained towards him. <span class="cmt_word">The women came out of all cities of Israel... to meet king Saul.</span> It is evident that this refers to some grand occasion, and probably to the conclusion of a peace between the two nations. The battle in the valley of Elah was probably followed by several years of warfare, during which David developed those great military qualities which made him subsequently the founder of the wide empire over which Solomon reigned. It was unendurable for Saul, himself a great soldier, to find, when the war at last was over, that the people recognised in his lieutenant higher military qualities than they had discovered in himself. <span class="cmt_word">With tabrets.</span> See on 1 Samuel 10:5. <span class="cmt_word">With joy.</span> As this is placed between the names of two instruments of music, it must mean some kind of joyous shouting or singing to the sound of their tabrets. <span class="cmt_word">With instruments of music.</span> Hebrew, with triangles, a very ancient but effective instrument for an outdoor procession accompanied with dancing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:6-11 David's troubles not only immediately follow his triumphs, but arise from them; such is the vanity of that which seems greatest in this world. It is a sign that the Spirit of God is departed from men, if, like Saul, they are peevish, envious, suspicious, and ill-natured. Compare David, with his harp in his hand, aiming to serve Saul, and Saul, with his javelin in his hand, aiming to slay David; and observe the sweetness and usefulness of God's persecuted people, and the barbarity of their persecutors. But David's safety must be ascribed to God's providence.</body></html>
