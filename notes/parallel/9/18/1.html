In 1 Samuel 16 this Court life of the future king has been already touched upon, notably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/18-21.htm" title="And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Why Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son in law in the one of the two.">1Samuel 18:21-23</a>, where the affection of Saul for David was mentioned, where also the appointing of the young shepherd to a post about the king's person is recorded. But this mention in 1 Samuel 16 considerably anticipated the course of events. In relating the results of this affection of Saul for David, the writer of what we may term the episode treating of the influence of music and poetry passed over, so to speak, the story of several years, in the course of which took place the single combat of David with the Philistine giant, and the victorious campaign in which the young hero took so distinguished a part. The history here takes up the thread of the future king's life, after the campaigns which immediately followed the discomfiture of the Philistine champion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1Samuel 18:6</a> and following). <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/18-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.">1Samuel 18:1-4</a> simply relate the beginning of the world-famous friendship between Prince Jonathan and David.<p>The Hebrew is rendered "was knit," or better, was <span class= "ital">bound up. </span>This is a strong term, and is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-30.htm" title="Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;">Genesis 44:30</a> of Jacob's love to Benjamin: "seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life." Aristotle, <span class= "ital">Nicom. ix.</span> 8, has noted that friends are called one soul.<p><span class= "bld">Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</span>--As has been before remarked, the character of the princely son of Saul is one of the most beautiful in the Old Testament story. He was the type of a true warrior of those wild, half-barbarous times--among brave men seemingly the bravest--a perfect soldier, whether fighting as a simple man-at-arms or as the general of an army--chivalrous and generous--utterty free from jealousy--a fervid believer in the God of Israel--a devoted and loyal son--a true patriot in the highest sense of the word, who sealed a devoted life by a noble death, dying as he did fighting for his king and his people. The long and steady friendship of Jonathan no doubt had a powerful and enduring influence on the after life of the greatest of the Hebrew sovereigns. The words, the unselfish, beautiful love, and, above all, the splendid example of the ill-fated son of Saul, have no doubt given their colouring to many of the noblest utterances in David's Psalms and to not a few of the most heroic deeds in David's life.<p>We read of this friendship as dating from the morrow of the first striking deed of arms performed by David when he slew the giant. It is clear, however, that it was not the personal bravery of the boy hero, or the rare skill he showed in the encounter, which so singularly attracted Prince Jonathan. These things no one would have admired and honoured more than the son of Saul, but it needed more than splendid gallantry and rare skill to attract that great love of which we read. What won Jonathan's heart was the shepherd boy's sublime faith, his perfect childlike trust in the "Glorious Arm" of the Lord. Jonathan and David possessed one thing in common--an intense, unswerving belief in the power of Jehovah of Israel to keep and to save all who trusted in Him.<p>The two were typical Israelites, both possessing in a very high degree that intense confidence in the Mighty One of Israel which was the mainspring of the people's glory and success, and which, in the seemingly interminable days of their punishment and degradation, has been the power which has kept them still together--a people distinct, reserved yet for some mighty destiny in the unknown future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had made an end of speaking.</span> This conversation took place as soon as the pursuit of the Philistines and the collecting of the spoil were over. There would then be a muster of the Israelites, and Abner would naturally present the youthful champion to the king, who is represented as having virtually forgotten him, and as anxious to learn his history; nor had his stay been long enough for Abner to remember him. As this conversation is narrated as an introduction to the account of Jonathan's friendship for David, the last four verses of ch. 17. ought to be prefixed to ch. 18. A new beginning commences with them, in which we are told of the commencement of this friendship, of the growth of Saul's hatred, and of the trials which befell David, proceeding on the king's part from bad to worse, till at last he was driven away and compelled to lead the life of an outlaw. But by his envy, cruelty, and bad government Saul was alienating the minds of the people from him, and preparing the way for his own downfall and David's ultimate triumph. The episode of Jonathan's love is as beautiful as Saul's conduct is dark, and completes our admiration for this generous and noble hero. <span class="cmt_word">The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David.</span> These kindred spirits had so much in common that, as David with modest manliness answered the king's questions, an intense feeling of admiration grew up in the young warrior's heart, and a friendship was the result which ranks among the purest and noblest examples of true manly affection. The word rendered <span class="accented">knit</span> literally means <span class="accented">knotted</span>, tied together firmly by indissoluble bonds. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-5 The friendship of David and Jonathan was the effect of Divine grace, which produces in true believers one heart and one soul, and causes them to love each other. This union of souls is from partaking in the Spirit of Christ. Where God unites hearts, carnal matters are too weak to separate them. Those who love Christ as their own souls, will be willing to join themselves to him in an everlasting covenant. It was certainly a great proof of the power of God's grace in David, that he was able to bear all this respect and honour, without being lifted up above measure.</body></html>
