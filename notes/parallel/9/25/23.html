Her worst fears she found realised when she met David, probably at no great distance from the principal residence of Nabal, accompanied by so large an armed force, evidently bent on some deed of violence. She deprecated his wrath by representing her husband not merely as a bad man, but as one scarcely responsible for his actions. Had <span class= "ital">she </span>only known of the mission of David's followers to Nabal, she implies, very different indeed had been their reception; they would not, at least, have returned to David empty-handed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abigail... fell before David on her face.</span> This very abject obeisance may have been grounded on her belief in David's future kingship, or it may simply mark the inferior position held by women in those days (see ver. 41). Her whole address is couched in very humble terms. David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-8.htm">1 Samuel 24:8</a>) only stooped with his face to the ground before Saul. <span class="cmt_word">Upon me.</span> Abigail represents herself as the person really guilty, on whom the <span class="cmt_word">iniquity</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the punishment of the offence, must fall. Nabal is a mere <span class="cmt_word">son of Belial,</span> a worthless, bad man, whose name Nabal, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fool, is a sign that folly is with him, and accompanies all his acts. As a fool he is scarcely accountable for his doings, and Abigail, whose wont and business it was to set things to rights, <span class="cmt_word">saw not the young men,</span> and so was unable to save them from her husband's rudeness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:18-31 By a present Abigail atoned for Nabal's denial of David's request. Her behaviour was very submissive. Yielding pacifies great offences. She puts herself in the place of a penitent, and of a petitioner. She could not excuse her husband's conduct. She depends not upon her own reasonings, but on God's grace, to soften David, and expects that grace would work powerfully. She says that it was below him to take vengeance on so weak and despicable an enemy as Nabal, who, as he would do him no kindness, so he could do him no hurt. She foretells the glorious end of David's present troubles. God will preserve thy life; therefore it becomes not thee unjustly and unnecessarily to take away the lives of any, especially of the people of thy God and Saviour. Abigail keeps this argument for the last, as very powerful with so good a man; that the less he indulged his passion, the more he consulted his peace and the repose of his own conscience. Many have done that in a heat, which they have a thousand times wished undone again. The sweetness of revenge is soon turned into bitterness. When tempted to sin, we should consider how it will appear when we think upon it afterwards.</body></html>
