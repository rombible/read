The Syriac and Arabic Versions, followed by some commentators, instead of "enemies of David," read "his servant David." The LXX., as usual, boldly cuts the knot by leaving out the word of difficulty, and reads "David" simply, omitting "enemies." But there is no doubt that the Hebrew text here is correct. The words signify David himself. If God's anger for the broken vow visited even David's enemies, as distantly connected with him, how much more the guilty oath breaker himself? (This was Raschi's explanation for a similar expression in Jonathan's oath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-16.htm" title="So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.">1Samuel 20:16</a>.) "A superstitious feeling probably lay at the root of this substitution of David's enemies for himself, when thus invoking a curse" (Dean Payne Smith, in the <span class= "ital">Pulpit Commentary</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Bishop Wordsworth here draws a good lesson on the non-obligation to keep a solemn oath, taken perhaps in a moment of undue excitement, and instances the evil example of Herod Antipas, who considered himself bound to carry out to the bitter end his rash oath to the daughter of Herodias, though it involved the death of John the Baptist, his former friend.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:18-31 By a present Abigail atoned for Nabal's denial of David's request. Her behaviour was very submissive. Yielding pacifies great offences. She puts herself in the place of a penitent, and of a petitioner. She could not excuse her husband's conduct. She depends not upon her own reasonings, but on God's grace, to soften David, and expects that grace would work powerfully. She says that it was below him to take vengeance on so weak and despicable an enemy as Nabal, who, as he would do him no kindness, so he could do him no hurt. She foretells the glorious end of David's present troubles. God will preserve thy life; therefore it becomes not thee unjustly and unnecessarily to take away the lives of any, especially of the people of thy God and Saviour. Abigail keeps this argument for the last, as very powerful with so good a man; that the less he indulged his passion, the more he consulted his peace and the repose of his own conscience. Many have done that in a heat, which they have a thousand times wished undone again. The sweetness of revenge is soon turned into bitterness. When tempted to sin, we should consider how it will appear when we think upon it afterwards.</body></html>
