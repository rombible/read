It is now a favourite and common inscription on Jewish gravestones. Keil beautifully paraphrases the words of the original. "The words," he writes, "do not refer primarily to eternal life with God in heaven, but only to the safe preservation of the righteous on this earth in the grace and fellowship of the Lord. <span class= "ital">But whoever is so hidden in the gracious fellowship of the Lord in this life, that no enemy can harm him or injure his life, the Lord will not allow to perish, even though temporal death should come, but will then receive him into eternal life"--Keil.</span><p>The image, as so often in Eastern teaching, is taken from common every-day life--from the habit, as Dean Payne Smith remarks, of packing up in a bundle articles of great value or of indispensable use, so that the owner may carry them about his person. In India the phrase is common. Thus, a just judge is said to be bound up in the bundle of righteousness; a lover in the bundle of love. Among the striking references in the Babylonian Talmud to this loved and cherished saying of the wife of Nabal, we find how, in one of the Treatises of <span class= "ital">Seder Moed, </span>"Rabbi Ezra says, <span class= "ital">The souls of the righteous are hidden beneath God's glorious throne: </span>as it is said, The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>fol. 152, col. 2.<p>What student of this verse of the Book of Samuel, and the beautiful Talmud comments on the far-reaching words, can fail to see in them the original of St. John's well-known picture of the "souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a>)--these souls of the righteous hidden beneath the glorious throne of God.<p>The thought is embodied in the following extract. <span class= "ital">"</span>The angel of death came and stood before Moses. Give me thy soul, said he; but Moses rebuked him, and said, thou hast no permission to come where he (Moses) was; and he departed crest-fallen. Then the Holy One--blessed be He !--took the soul of Moses, and hid it under His throne of glory: as it is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-29.htm" title="Yet a man is risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.">1Samuel 25:29</a>): 'And the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life.' But when He took it He took it by means of a kiss."--<span class= "ital">Avoth. of Rabbi Nathan, </span>1 Samuel 12.<p>In the <span class= "ital">Seder Moed, </span>again, in the same Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>there is a remarkable parable, founded on this saying of Abigail: a parable that reminds us of the framework of one of the well-known pictures of the Redeemer. A king once distributed royal robes among his servants; those that were wise folded them up and laid them by in a coffer, and those that were foolish wore them on their working days. When the king demanded back his robes, those given to the wise were returned free from stains, whilst those of the foolish were soiled. The king, pleased with the wise servants, ordered their robes to be deposited in his treasury, and then that they should depart in peace. But he manifested his displeasure at the foolish servants; he sent their robes to be washed, and dispatched them to prison. So the bodies of the righteous "enter into peace, and rest in their beds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-2.htm" title="He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.">Isaiah 57:2</a>), and their souls are bound up in the bundle of life; but with reference to the bodies of the foolish there is no peace, saith the Lord, and the wicked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-21.htm" title="There is no peace, said my God, to the wicked.">Isaiah 57:21</a>) and their souls (quoting the next paragraph of this chapter of Samuel) are slung out, as out of the middle of a sling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-29.htm" title="Yet a man is risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.">1Samuel 25:29</a>).--Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>fol. 152, col. 2.<p><span class= "bld">And the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</span>--The simile was one Abigail had with all probability heard from one or other of the prophets or their pupils. It was not unlikely originally suggested by the ever memorable encounter between David and Goliath: as in the case of the souls of the righteous, in the passage just discussed, the reference in the first instance was to the fate of the enemies of God in this life; but Hebrew theologians in all times have understood it in a deeper and more solemn sense, as a reference to the doom after death reserved for all unrighteous. (See, for instance, above in the passage quoted from the Talmud, Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath.</span>) In the same most ancient writing?which, most probably, contains the teaching of the great Jewish schools before the Christian era--we read: "The souls of the wicked are incessantly thrown by angels, as with a sling, from one end of the world to the other, as it is said: 'The souls of thine enemies shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling;' and what, asks Ravah of Rav. Nachman (this is a later comment), is the lot of those who are neither righteous nor wicked? They, as well as the wicked, are handed over to 'Dumah'--<span class= "ital">silence </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm" title="The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.">Psalm 115:17</a>)--an angel who has charge of disembodied spirits. The former, the neither righteous nor wicked, have rest; the latter, the wicked, have none."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>fol. 152, col. 2.<p>The strange wild statement, as it seems to us, is no doubt a cryptograph; and the great rabbis of old days in their famous schools would now and again unrol its meaning. With that, for the present, we have not to concern ourselves. But the bare text, as we copy it from the Talmud, conveys to us this important fact,--that men and women in the Canaan of Samuel and Saul--people who lived remote, as it would seem, from any famous centre of civilisation, in the midst of shepherds and herdsmen in the lone sheep farms of Judah and Benjamin--believed in the glories of the life eternal with God, and looked on to a future state of rewards and punishments, instead of limiting their hopes and fears to the sitting in quiet peace under the vine and the fig tree of their own loved land of promise.<p>The knowledge of a future state of existence was ever the blessed heritage of the chosen race--but the spread of that knowledge and the re-awakening of that belief we ascribe to the beneficial influence of one man. The Divine record, if we read between its lines, and the mighty wealth of Hebrew tradition, if we take sufficient pains to make it our own, tell us one story--how Samuel, whom, when he was a child, the God of Israel loved: with whom, during his long and blameless life, He used to speak face to face--now by a vision, now by the echo of a voice--tell us how Samuel was the founder of those great Prophetic Schools where the lamp of the knowledge of God was re-lit, and then kept burning with a steady flame through his time and for centuries after: the one bright light during the long, sad record of Israel.<p>Hero-kings like David, prophets like Gad and Nathan, the great psalm writers and musicians of the Temple of Solomon, were the more prominent results of the peculiar teaching and spirit of these "schools;" but their noblest work, after all, was the high and beneficial influence they exercised over the people of the land--an influence exemplified in such characters as that of Abigail, the sheep-master of Carmel's wife, a page of whose life story we have just been considering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet a man is risen.</span> Rather, "And should any one arise to pursue thee," etc. The reference is of course to Saul, but put with due reserve, and also made general, so as to include all possible injury attempted against David. <span class="cmt_word">Bound in the bundle of life.</span> Hebrew, "of the living." The metaphor is taken from the habit of packing up in a bundle articles of great value or of indispensable use, so that the owner may carry them about his person. In India the phrase is common; thus, a just judge is said to be bound up in the bundle of righteousness; a lover in the bundle of love. Abigail prays, therefore, that David may, with others whose life is precious in God's sight, be securely kept under Jehovah's personal care and protection. In modern times the two words signifying "in the bundle of the living" form a common inscription on Jewish gravestones, the phrase having been interpreted in the Talmud, as also by Abravanel and other Jewish authorities, of a future life. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he sling out,</span> etc. In forcible contrast with this careful preservation of David's life, she prays that his enemies may be cast away as violently and to as great a distance as a stone is cast out of a sling. The <span class="cmt_word">middle</span> is the hollow in which the stone was placed. <span class="cmt_word">Ruler</span>. i.e. prince. It is the word rendered <span class="accented">captain</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>, but its meaning is more correctly given here. <span class="cmt_word">Grief</span>. The word really means much the same as stumbling block, something which makes a person stagger by his striking against it unawares. Abigail prays, therefore, that when David has become prince, and so has to administer justice, this violent and revengeful act which he was purposing might not prove a cause of stumbling and an offence of heart to himself, by his conscience reproaching him for having himself done that which he had to condemn in others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:18-31 By a present Abigail atoned for Nabal's denial of David's request. Her behaviour was very submissive. Yielding pacifies great offences. She puts herself in the place of a penitent, and of a petitioner. She could not excuse her husband's conduct. She depends not upon her own reasonings, but on God's grace, to soften David, and expects that grace would work powerfully. She says that it was below him to take vengeance on so weak and despicable an enemy as Nabal, who, as he would do him no kindness, so he could do him no hurt. She foretells the glorious end of David's present troubles. God will preserve thy life; therefore it becomes not thee unjustly and unnecessarily to take away the lives of any, especially of the people of thy God and Saviour. Abigail keeps this argument for the last, as very powerful with so good a man; that the less he indulged his passion, the more he consulted his peace and the repose of his own conscience. Many have done that in a heat, which they have a thousand times wished undone again. The sweetness of revenge is soon turned into bitterness. When tempted to sin, we should consider how it will appear when we think upon it afterwards.</body></html>
