The Carmel here mentioned is not the famous Mount Carmel in the north, but the small town, the modern Kurmeel, near Maon, of which we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-12.htm" title="And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.">1Samuel 15:12</a>, when Saul set up a place or monument after the war with Amalek.<p><span class= "bld">And the man was very great.</span>--The wealthy chief--the subject of the story--was a descendant of Caleb, the friend and comrade of Joshua, who at the time of the conquest of Canaan obtained vast possessions in the valley of Hebron and in the south of Judah. The tradition even has preserved to us the exact number of his flocks, probably to enhance the churlishness of his reply to David when he asked him for some return for the protection his armed bands had afforded to these vast flocks in their pasturage on the edge of the desert. The occasion of David's mission to Nabal was the annual sheep-shearing of the rich sheep-master--always a great occasion, and accompanied usually on large estates by festivities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man in Maon.</span> Though strictly by descent belonging to Maon (for which see on 1 Samuel 23:24), his <span class="cmt_word">possessions</span> - rather, "his business," "occupation" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-3.htm">Genesis 47:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>, where it is translated <span class="accented">work</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">were in Carmel,</span> the small town just north of Maon, where Saul set up a trophy at the end of the Amalekite war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-12.htm">1 Samuel 15:12</a>), and to which Abigail belonged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>). He is described as <span class="cmt_word">very great</span> because of his wealth arising from his large flocks of sheep and goats, which fed upon the pasture land which forms the elevated plateau of Carmel, where <span class="cmt_word">he was shearing his sheep,</span> usually a time of lavish hospitality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23, 24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:2-11 We should not have heard of Nabal, if nothing had passed between him and David. Observe his name, Nabal, A fool; so it signifies. Riches make men look great in the eye of the world; but to one that takes right views, Nabal looked very mean. He had no honour or honesty; he was churlish, cross, and ill-humoured; evil in his doings, hard and oppressive; a man that cared not what fraud and violence he used in getting and saving. What little reason have we to value the wealth of this world, when so great a churl as Nabal abounds, and so good a man as David suffers want!, David pleaded the kindness Nabal's shepherds had received. Considering that David's men were in distress and debt, and discontented, and the scarcity of provisions, it was by good management that they were kept from plundering. Nabal went into a passion, as covetous men are apt to do, when asked for any thing, thinking thus to cover one sin with another; and, by abusing the poor, to excuse themselves from relieving them. But God will not thus be mocked. Let this help us to bear reproaches and misrepresentations with patience and cheerfulness, and make us easy under them; it has often been the lot of the excellent ones of the earth. Nabal insists much on the property he had in the provisions of his table. May he not do what he will with his own? We mistake, if we think we are absolute lords of what we have, and may do what we please with it. No; we are but stewards, and must use it as we are directed, remembering it is not our own, but His who intrusted us with it.</body></html>
