The first who seems to have violated God's original ordinance appears to have been Lamech, of the family of Cain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-19.htm" title="And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.">Genesis 4:19</a>). The practice apparently had become general throughout the East when the Mosaic Law was formulated. In this Divine code it is noticeable that while polygamy is accepted as a custom everywhere prevailing, it is never approved. The laws of Moses--as in the case of another universally accepted practice, slavery--simply seek to restrict and limit it by wise and humane regulations. The inspired writer in this narrative of the home life of Elkanah of "Ramah of the Watchers<span class= "ital">" </span>quietly shows up the curse which almost invariably attended this miserable violation of the relations of the home life to which in the old Eden days the eternal law had given its sanction and blessing. The Old Testament Book contains many of these gently-worded but fire-tipped rebukes of sin and frailty--sins condoned and even approved by the voice of mankind.<p><span class= "bld">Peninnah.</span>--Hannah signifies grace or favour, and has ever been a favourite name among the women of the East. It was the name of the Punic Queen Dido's sister, Anna. The traditional mother of the Virgin Mary was named Anna. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>.) Peninnah is translated by some scholars "coral;" according to others it signifies "pearl." We have adopted the same name under the modem "Margaret."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - As a wealthy man, Elkanah <span class="cmt_word">had two wives, Hannah</span> - the Anna of Virgil, who very properly gives this name to the sister of the Phoenician Dido, the language of Phoenicia being identical with Hebrew - <span class="cmt_word">and Peninnah.</span> The word Hannah signifies <span class="accented">gracefulness</span>, while Peulnnah is the <span class="accented">red pearl</span>, translated coral in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>, but ruby in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>, etc. Its ruddy colour is vouched for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>. The Hebrew names for women generally bear witness to the affection and respect felt for them; while those for men are usually religious. Though polygamy was a licence permitted to the Jews, it does not seem to have been generally indulged in, except by the kings. Here, as elsewhere, it was the ruin of family life. In Christianity it was marked for final extinction by the rule that no polygamist should be admitted even to the diaconate, and much less to higher office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2, 12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Elkanah kept up his attendance at God's altar, notwithstanding the unhappy differences in his family. If the devotions of a family prevail not to put an end to its divisions, yet let not the divisions put a stop to the devotions. To abate our just love to any relation for the sake of any infirmity which they cannot help, and which is their affliction, is to make God's providence quarrel with his precept, and very unkindly to add affliction to the afflicted. It is evidence of a base disposition, to delight in grieving those who are of a sorrowful spirit, and in putting those out of humour who are apt to fret and be uneasy. We ought to bear one another's burdens, not add to them. Hannah could not bear the provocation. Those who are of a fretful spirit, and are apt to lay provocations too much to heart, are enemies to themselves, and strip themselves of many comforts both of life and godliness. We ought to notice comforts, to keep us from grieving for crosses. We should look at that which is for us, as well as what is against us.</body></html>
