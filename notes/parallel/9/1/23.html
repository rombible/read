but there was an ancient Rabbinical tradition that a direct revelation respecting the future destiny of Samuel was made. "The Bath-kol (Daughter of the Voice) went forth, saying, There shall arise a just one, whose name shall be Samuel. Then every mother who bore a son called him Samuel; but when they saw his actions, they said, This is not Samuel. But when this one was born, they said, This is that Samuel, and this is what the Scripture means when it says, 'The Lord confirmed his word that Samuel may be that just one.'"--<span class= "ital">Rashi.</span><p>If we decline to accept the Rabbinical tradition, Bunsen's simple comment will explain the difficult words of the text, "establish his word": that is, may the Lord fulfil what He designs with him, and has promised by his birth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-28 Elkanah and his family had a journey before them, and a family of children to take with them, yet they would not move till they had worshipped God together. Prayer and provender do not hinder a journey. When men are in such haste to set out upon journeys, or to engage in business, that they have not time to worship God, they are likely to proceed without his presence and blessing. Hannah, though she felt a warm regard for the courts of God's house, begged to stay at home. God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Those who are detained from public ordinances, by the nursing and tending of little children, may take comfort from this instance, and believe, that if they do that duty in a right spirit, God will graciously accept them therein. Hannah presented her child to the Lord with a grateful acknowledgment of his goodness in answer to prayer. Whatever we give to God, it is what we have first asked and received from him. All our gifts to him were first his gifts to us. The child Samuel early showed true piety. Little children should be taught to worship God when very young. Their parents should teach them in it, bring them to it, and put them on doing it as well as they can; God will graciously accept them, and will teach them to do better.</body></html>
