It is a common historical introductory formula. We find it at the commencement of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Kings, Esther, Ezra, Ezekiel, &c. The circumstances under which this record was probably compiled are discussed elsewhere.<p><span class= "bld">Of Ramathaim-zophim.</span>--The name Ramathaim--literally, <span class= "ital">The Two Ramahs</span>--is the dual of the well-known Ramah, the appellation by which this city is usually known. The old city was, no doubt, built on two hills, which looked one on the other: hence perhaps the name Zophim, <span class= "ital">the watchers. </span>Possibly at an early date watch-towers or outlooks, to enable the citizens to guard against surprise, were built on the summit of these hills. Either of these suppositions would account for the suggestive name by which Ramah was once known, the "Ramahs of the Watchers."<p>Others would connect the appellation "Zophim" with the family of Zuph, from whom Elkanah descended. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-35.htm" title="The son of Zuph, the son of Elkanah, the son of Mahath, the son of Amasai,">1Chronicles 6:35</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-5.htm" title="And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.">1Samuel 9:5</a>, where the land of Zuph is mentioned.) An interesting. though fanciful, derivation refers Zophim, <span class= "ital">watchers, </span>to the "prophet-watchmen" of the house of Israel, as Ramah in after years was a school of the prophets.<p>On the whole, the simplest and least strained explanation is the one given above, which refers the name to the hills so placed that they watched one another, or better still, to the watch-towers built at an early date on the two summits.<p>Ramah lay among the mountains of Ephraim, which extended into the territory of Benjamin, in which tribe the city of Ramah lay.<p><span class= "bld">His name was Elkanah.</span>--Elkanah, the father of the future prophet-judge, was a Levite of the family of Kohath (compare the genealogy given here with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-22.htm" title="The sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,">1Chronicles 6:22</a>). He is here termed an Ephrathite: that is, an Ephraimite, because, as far as his civil standing was concerned, he belonged to the tribe of Ephraim.<p>Some have found a difficulty in reconciling the Levitical descent of Samuel with his dedication to the Lord by his mother, supposing that in the case of a Levite this would be unnecessary; but the dedication of Samuel, it should be remembered, was a life-long one, whereas the Levitical service only began when the Levite was twenty-five years old; and even then the service was not continuous.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim.</span> Though Samuel belonged to the tribe of Levi, yet no special mention is made of the fact, because he owed his importance and rank as a judge not to his Levitical origin, but to the gift of prophecy, which was independent of the accidents of birth and station. In the First Book of Chronicles, ch. 6, his parentage is twice given, that in vers. 22-28 being apparently the family genealogy, while that in vers. 33-38 was probably taken from the records of the temple singers, sprung from Heman, Samuel's grandson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>). His name there appears as Shemuel, our translators not having perceived that it is the same as that for which elsewhere they give the familiar rendering, Samuel. The variations Elkanah, Jeroham, Elihu, Tohu, Zuph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>); Elkanah, Jeroham, Eliab, Nahath, Zophai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-26.htm">1 Chronicles 6:26, 27</a>); Elkanah, Jeroham, Eliel, Toah, Zuph (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 34, 35), are interesting as showing that the genealogies in Chronicles. were compiled from family documents, in which, as was usual in the case of proper names, there was much diversity of spelling, or possibly of interpreting the cumbrous signs used for letters in those early days. The variations, however, in Elihu (God is he), Eliab (God is Father), and Eliel (God is God) were probably intentional, as were certainly other changes in names, such as that of Ishbaal into Ishbosheth. The name of Samuel's father, <span class="accented">Elkanah</span> (God is owner), is a common one among the Kohathites, to which division of the sons of Levi Samuel belonged. The prophet's birthplace was <span class="cmt_word">Ramathaim-Zophim,</span> no doubt the Ramah which was Samuel s own head-quarters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-34.htm">1 Samuel 15:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-18.htm">1 Samuel 19:18-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1</a>); the place where he dwelt, wrought, died, and was buried, and the Arimathsea of the Gospels. The Septuagint generally gives the name in full, but this is the only place where it is so written in the Hebrew. Ramah signifies a <span class="accented">height</span>, and the dual Ramathaim the <span class="accented">double height</span>, the town being situated on a hill ending in two peaks. But which it was of the many Ramahs, or hill towns, in the Holy Land, is hotly contested; probably it was the Ramah in Benjamin, about two hours' journey northwest of Jerusalem. Its second name, Zophim, is taken from Zuph, Samuel's remote ancestor, with whom the genealogy here begins. Zuph had apparently emigrated from Ephraim, one of the three tribes (Ephraim, Manasseh, Dan) to which the Kohathites were attached, and was a person of sufficient power and energy to give his name to the whole district; called the land of Zuph in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>. His descendants, the Zophim, had Ramah as their centre, and Elkanah, as their head, would be a man of wealth and influence. Though actually belonging to the tribe of Benjamin, Ramah is said to be upon Mount Ephraim, because this limestone range extended to and kept its name almost up to Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-8.htm">2 Chronicles 15:8</a>, compared with 2 Chronicles 13:19). Elkanah too is called an Ephrathite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an Ephraimite, no doubt because before Zuph emigrated the family had belonged to Ephraim, it being apparently the practice to reckon Levites as pertaining to the tribes to which they were attached (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>). The Hebrews Ephrathite is rightly rendered Ephraimite in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>, and should be so translated here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a> it means Bethlehemite, that town being also called Ephratah, <span class="accented">the fruitful</span>; Ephraim has the same meaning, but being a dual, no adjective can be formed from it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Elkanah kept up his attendance at God's altar, notwithstanding the unhappy differences in his family. If the devotions of a family prevail not to put an end to its divisions, yet let not the divisions put a stop to the devotions. To abate our just love to any relation for the sake of any infirmity which they cannot help, and which is their affliction, is to make God's providence quarrel with his precept, and very unkindly to add affliction to the afflicted. It is evidence of a base disposition, to delight in grieving those who are of a sorrowful spirit, and in putting those out of humour who are apt to fret and be uneasy. We ought to bear one another's burdens, not add to them. Hannah could not bear the provocation. Those who are of a fretful spirit, and are apt to lay provocations too much to heart, are enemies to themselves, and strip themselves of many comforts both of life and godliness. We ought to notice comforts, to keep us from grieving for crosses. We should look at that which is for us, as well as what is against us.</body></html>
