The circumstances which led to the transfer of the dignity from the line of Eleazar, who succeeded his father Aaron in the office, are unknown. It has been suggested that at the death of the <span class= "ital">last high </span>priest of the line of Eleazar, Ozi, there was no son of sufficient age and experience to succeed, and so the office passed to the next of kin, Eli, a son of the house of Ithamar. (See Josephus, <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span>, 2, ? 5.)<p>The seat upon which Eli is represented as usually sitting (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.">1Samuel 4:18</a>) was evidently a chair or throne of state, where the high-priestly judge sat at certain times to administer justice and to transact business. The Hebrew word rendered here "post," and the expression "doors of the house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-15.htm" title="And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.">1Samuel 3:15</a>), seem to suggest that now a permanent home had been erected for the sanctuary: something of a building, possibly of stone, surrounding the Tabernacle had been built.<p>The "temple of the Lord," rather, <span class= "ital">palace of the Lord, </span>so called not from any external magnificence but as being the earthly place where at times the visible glory of the Eternal King of Israel, the Shekinah, was pleased to manifest itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After they had eaten .... after they had drunk.</span> The Hebrew favours the translation, "After she had eaten in Shiloh, and after she had drunk;" the somewhat forced rendering of the A.V. having arisen from a supposed discrepancy between this verse and ver. 7. Really there is none. The words simply mean that Hannah took part in the sacrificial banquet, though she did so without appetite or pleasure; and thus they connect her visit to the temple and her prayer with the most solemn religious service of the year. To take part in this banquet was a duty, but as soon as she had fulfilled it she withdrew to the temple to pour out her grief before God. There Eli, <span class="cmt_word">the priest,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the high priest, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-2.htm">Numbers 27:2</a>, was seated upon, not a seat, but <span class="accented">the</span> pontifical throne, placed at the entrance leading into the inner court of the tabernacle, so that all who came to worship must pass before him. It is remarkable that the tabernacle is called the <span class="accented">temple</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>), or, more literally, the "palace" of Jehovah, his royal residence; and it thus appears that the name had come into use before Solomon's building was erected. The curtains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>) also had given place to a <span class="accented">mezuzah</span>, translated <span class="accented">a post</span>, but really a sort of porch, with doors, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-5.htm">1 Kings 7:5</a>). As the tabernacle remained stationary at Shiloh for 300 years, naturally numerous buildings of a more solid nature grew up around it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-18 Hannah mingled tears with her prayers; she considered the mercy of our God, who knows the troubled soul. God gives us leave, in prayer, not only to ask good things in general, but to mention that special good thing we most need and desire. She spoke softly, none could hear her. Hereby she testified her belief of God's knowledge of the heart and its desires. Eli was high priest, and judge in Israel. It ill becomes us to be rash and hasty in censures of others, and to think people guilty of bad things while the matter is doubtful and unproved. Hannah did not retort the charge, and upbraid Eli with the wicked conduct of his own sons. When we are at any time unjustly censured, we have need to set a double watch before the door of our lips, that we do not return censure for censure. Hannah thought it enough to clear herself, and so must we. Eli was willing to acknowledge his mistake. Hannah went away with satisfaction of mind. She had herself by prayer committed her case to God, and Eli had prayed for her. Prayer is heart's ease to a gracious soul. Prayer will smooth the countenance; it should do so. None will long remain miserable, who use aright the privilege of going to the mercy-seat of a reconciled God in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
