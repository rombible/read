David certainly, in his protestations of loyalty, could scarcely humble himself more than by drawing a comparison between the king of Israel in his grandeur and power and a poor dead dog--evidently an object held in special loathing by the Hebrews. "After a flea"--the original is even stronger, after "one flea" (a single flea)--"against <span class= "ital">a single flea," </span>which is not easily caught, and easily escapes, and if it is caught, is poor game for a royal hunter.--<span class= "ital">Berl. Bible </span>and <span class= "ital">Lange.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - Finally, David makes a pathetic appeal to Saul, contrasting him in his grandeur as <span class="cmt_word">the king of Israel</span> with the fugitive whom he so relentlessly persecuted. In calling himself a <span class="cmt_word">dead dog</span> he implies that he was at once despicable and powerless. Even more insignificant is <span class="cmt_word">a flea</span>, Hebrew, "one flea," "a single flea." The point is lost by omitting the numeral. David means that it is unworthy of a king to go forth with 3000 men to hunt a single flea. As the king's conduct is thus both unjust and foolish, David <span class="cmt_word">therefore</span> appeals to Jehovah to be judge and <span class="cmt_word">plead his cause,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be his advocate, and state the proofs of his innocence. For <span class="cmt_word">deliver me out of thy hand,</span> the Hebrew is, "will judge me out of thy hand," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will judge me, and by doing so justly will deliver me from thy power. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-15 David was falsely charged with seeking Saul's hurt; he shows Saul that God's providence had given him opportunity to do it. And it was upon a good principle that he refused to do it. He declares his fixed resolution never to be his own avenger. If men wrong us, God will right us, at farthest, in the judgment of the great day.</body></html>
