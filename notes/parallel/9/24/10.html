thus the king's eye had seen--nay, was seeing that very moment--that his life had been in his enemy David's hand.<p><span class= "bld">And some bade me kill thee.</span>--The literal translation here would be <span class= "ital">Jehovah delivered thee to-day into mine hand in the cave, and bade </span>[me] <span class= "ital">kill thee. </span>And this rendering has been explained by assuming that God's <span class= "ital">allowing </span>Saul to choose the very cavern for his midday slumber where David and his company were lodging was tantamount to <span class= "ital">directing </span>David to slay his bitter foe, thus given over helpless into his hands; but this is contrary to the spirit of the whole narrative. The English Version has followed the Syriac and Chaldee Versions here, and by supplying "some"--better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">one</span>--before "bade me kill thee," has given us the sense in which the Hebrews have always understood the passage. The Vulg. here, with a very slight change in the vowel points, renders "I thought to kill thee."<p><span class= "bld">But mine eye spared thee.</span>--The English Version supplies an obvious subject in "mine eye." Clericus suggests more happily, "my soul," or "my hand," before "spared thee."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-15 David was falsely charged with seeking Saul's hurt; he shows Saul that God's providence had given him opportunity to do it. And it was upon a good principle that he refused to do it. He declares his fixed resolution never to be his own avenger. If men wrong us, God will right us, at farthest, in the judgment of the great day.</body></html>
