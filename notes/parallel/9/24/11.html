The Princess Michal before this time probably had been given to Phalti. The <span class= "ital">time </span>when this wicked act was carried out by Saul is left quite indefinite in the notice of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1Samuel 25:44</a><span class= "ital">; </span>but the relations of David and Saul were evidently far more bitter before than after the En-gedi incident, hence the probability of Michal's being given to Phalti <span class= "ital">before </span>this meeting is great. The expression "my father" is simply the reverence (<span class= "ital">pietas</span>) of the young to the old--of the loyal subject to the sovereign. It is so used in the beautiful lines of Browning already quoted.<p><span class= "bld">See the skirt of thy robe.</span>--Doubtless at this juncture holding up the piece of the royal <span class= "ital">m'il </span>he had so carefully cut off when the king was sleeping in fancied security.

So David calls himself Nabal's son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-8.htm">1 Samuel 25:8</a>). In the rest of the verse he contrasts his refusal to slay Saul, when it might have seemed as if it were Providence that had put him into his power, with Saul's determined pursuit of him. <span class="cmt_word">Thou huntest my soul to take it.</span> Thou perpetually usest every artifice and stratagem against me for the confessed purpose of killing me, and pursuest me as eagerly as the hunter pursues his game. Hence David commits his cause to Jehovah, in the sure confidence that he will avenge him, and with the firm determination never himself to raise his hand against one who, though his enemy, was also the king. In proof of the impossibility of his ever seeking the king's hurt, he quotes an ancient proverb, "From the wicked goeth out wickedness." Had David harboured evil intentions he would have executed them when so fair an opportunity offered, but as he has no such purposes "his hand will never be" upon Saul. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-15 David was falsely charged with seeking Saul's hurt; he shows Saul that God's providence had given him opportunity to do it. And it was upon a good principle that he refused to do it. He declares his fixed resolution never to be his own avenger. If men wrong us, God will right us, at farthest, in the judgment of the great day.</body></html>
