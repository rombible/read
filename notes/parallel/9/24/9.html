Doeg has been already mentioned as one of the more prominent of these slanderers; another was Cush the Benjamite, who was alluded to in the inscription which heads the seventh Psalm. The Ziphites and their representatives at the royal residence also belonged to this class of malicious foes spoken of here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - In his address David complained of Saul's listening to <span class="cmt_word">men's words,</span> which slanderously represented him as lying in wait to kill the king (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a>). In answer to their calumnies he now pleads Saul's own experience of his deeds. <span class="cmt_word">Some bade me kill thee.</span> Hebrew, "he bade to kill thee." The literal rendering is, "Jehovah delivered thee today into my hand, and bade kill thee." The A.V. supplies <span class="accented">some</span>, or, more exactly, "<span class="accented">one</span> said." This is supported by the Syriac and Chaldee, but the literal rendering is probably the right one. Had David killed Saul, it would have seemed as if it were ordered by Providence so to be, and as if by putting Saul into his power God had intended his death. But what seem to us to be the leadings of Providence are not to be blindly followed. Possibly David's first thought was that God intended Saul to die, and so the Vulgate, "I thought to kill thee. But immediately a truer feeling came over his mind, and he recognised that opportunities, such as that just given him, may be temptations to be overcome. The highest principles of religion and morality do not bend to external circumstances, but override them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-15 David was falsely charged with seeking Saul's hurt; he shows Saul that God's providence had given him opportunity to do it. And it was upon a good principle that he refused to do it. He declares his fixed resolution never to be his own avenger. If men wrong us, God will right us, at farthest, in the judgment of the great day.</body></html>
