Eliab seemed to Samuel in all respects a fit successor to the great warrior whom the Lord rejected. But the Divine voice gave no reply back to the prophet's mute questioning; and the other sons of Jesse, an imposing band of gallant youths, passed in review before the old seer, and were severally introduced to him; but the Divine voice only warned the seer that these external advantages of mere human beauty and strength, were no mark of true greatness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they were come.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to the house of Jesse, apparently in the interval between the sacrifice and the feast. The latter we learn in ver. 11 did not take place until after David had been sent for. But many hours would elapse between the sacrifice and the feast, as the victim had to be skinned and prepared for roasting, and finally cooked. This interval was spent in Jesse's house; and when he saw there Eliab, the first born, and observed his tall stature and handsome face, qualities which Samuel had admired in Saul, he <span class="cmt_word">said</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in himself, felt sure, that the goodly youth was <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah's anointed</span> (see on 1 Samuel 2:10, 35; 10:1, etc.), but is warned that these external advantages do not necessarily imply real worth of heart; and as <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah looketh on the heart,</span> his judgment depends, not on appearances, but on reality. As Eliab is thus rejected, Jesse makes his other sons pass before the prophet. Next <span class="cmt_word">Abinadab</span>, who has the same name as a son of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a>); then <span class="cmt_word">Shammah</span>, so called again in ch. 17:13, but Shimeah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3</a>, and Shimma in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>, where, however, the Hebrew is exactly the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3</a>. After these four other sons follow, of whom one apparently died young, as only seven are recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13-15</a>, whereas these with David make eight. To all these seven the Divine voice within Samuel gave no response, and he said unto Jesse, <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah hath not chosen these.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-13 It was strange that Samuel, who had been so disappointed in Saul, whose countenance and stature recommended him, should judge of another man by that rule. We can tell how men look, but God can tell what they are. He judges of men by the heart. We often form a mistaken judgment of characters; but the Lord values only the faith, fear, and love, which are planted in the heart, beyond human discernment. And God does not favour our children according to our fond partiality, but often most honours and blesses those who have been least regarded. David at length was pitched upon. He was the youngest of the sons of Jesse; his name signifies Beloved; he was a type of God's beloved Son. It should seem, David was least set by of all the sons of Jesse. But the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. His anointing was not an empty ceremony, a Divine power went with that instituted sign; he found himself advanced in wisdom and courage, with all the qualifications of a prince, though not advanced in his outward circumstances. This would satisfy him that his election was of God. The best evidence of our being predestinated to the kingdom of glory, is, our being sealed with the Spirit of promise, and experience of a work of grace in our hearts.</body></html>
