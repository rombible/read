In each of these passages the Hebrew word rendered "servant," no doubt signifies officers connected with the royal court. Here the different word <span class= "ital">hann'-?rim </span>lays stress on the royal attendant in question being a <span class= "ital">young man. </span>Probably, the one spoken of in this place was a contemporary of David, very likely a youth trained with David in Samuel's prophetic school at Naioth in Ramah, and consequently able to speak thus in detail about the young shepherd pupil of the great seer.<p><span class= "bld">Cunning in playing.</span>--As a boy, it is certain that David possessed rare gifts of poetry, and, no doubt, of music. It is probable that some of his early Psalms were originally composed while watching his father's sheep among those hills and vales round the village of Bethlehem, where "in later centuries shepherds were still watching over their flocks by night, when the angel host appeared to them to tell them of the birth of a child in Bethlehem."<p>These gifts of poetry and music were further cultivated and developed in the prophets' school of Samuel, and there the young pupil of the seer no doubt quickly acquired among his companions that reputation and skill which induced the "young man" of the court of Saul to tell his afflicted master of the shepherd son of Jesse, famous for his "cunning in playing."<p><span class= "bld">And a mighty valiant man, and a man of war.</span>--The description of the Bethlehemite David at a mighty valiant man can well be explained from what is related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-34.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:">1Samuel 17:34-35</a>, about the young shepherd's prowess in the conflicts with the lions and the bears. A question has, however, been raised respecting the expression "a man of war," as it would seem from the narrative of 1 Samuel 17 that the combat with the giant Philistine was David's first great military exploit. It has, however, been suggested that, in addition to the combat with those wild beasts, which we know in those days frequented the thickets of the Jordan, and were a terror to the Israelitish shepherds, David had most likely been engaged in repelling one or more of the Philistine marauding expeditions so common in those wild days. Bethlehem, we know, was a strong place or garrison of these hereditary foes of Israel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-14.htm" title="And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.">2Samuel 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-16.htm" title="And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.">1Chronicles 11:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:14-23 Saul is made a terror to himself. The Spirit of the Lord departed from him. If God and his grace do not rule us, sin and Satan will have possession of us. The devil, by the Divine permission, troubled and terrified Saul, by the corrupt humours of his body, and passions of his mind. He grew fretful, peevish, and discontented, and at times a madman. It is a pity that music, which may be serviceable to the good temper of the mind, should ever be abused, to support vanity and luxury, and made an occasion of drawing the heart from God and serious things. That is driving away the good Spirit, not the evil spirit. Music, diversions, company, or business, have for a time often been employed to quiet the wounded conscience; but nothing can effect a real cure but the blood of Christ, applied in faith, and the sanctifying Spirit sealing the pardon, by his holy comforts. All other plans to dispel religious melancholy are sure to add to distress, either in this world or the next.</body></html>
