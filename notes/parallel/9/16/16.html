We have several instances in ancient Greek literature, where this influence is recommended to soothe the passions or to heal mental disease. Pythagoras, whenever he would steep his mind in Divine power, was in the habit before he slept of having a harp played to him; 'sculapius, the physician, would often restore such sick souls with music. (See reference from Censorinus, <span class= "ital">De die natali, </span>quoted by Keil.) <p>"Priests would call<p>On Heaven for aid: but then his brow would lower<p>With treble gloom. Peace! Heaven is good to all.<p>To all, he sighed, but one--God hears no prayers for Saul<p>At length one spake of <span class= "ital">music."--</span>HANKINSON.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A cunning player on an harp.</span> Literally, one skilful in striking the chords on the harp. In Saul's case music would have a soothing influence, and turn the current of his thoughts. His officers suggest, therefore, that search should be made for an expert musician, and Saul consents; whereupon one of <span class="cmt_word">the servants</span> recommended the son of Jesse. The word used here is not the same as that found in vers. 15, 16, 17. There we have Saul's <span class="accented">officers</span>; here it is <span class="accented">na'arim</span>, "young men." Thus it was a youth of David's own age, who had probably been with him at Naioth in Ramah, that described him to Saul. The description is full and interesting, but it has its difficulties. David is not only skilful in music, of which art he would have had ample scope to manifest his powers in the service of the sanctuary at Ramah, but he is also <span class="cmt_word">a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters,</span> or, rather, <span class="accented">intelligent in speech</span> (see margin), as well as handsome and successful. Nevertheless, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-33.htm">1 Samuel 17:33-36</a> David appears as a youth about to make his first essay in fighting; and though the two exploits mentioned there, of killing the lion and the bear, might justify his friend in calling him <span class="cmt_word">a mighty valiant man,</span> literally, "a hero of valour," they do not justify the words <span class="cmt_word">a man of war.</span> It is strange, moreover, that Saul should be so entirely ignorant of David's person and lineage as he is represented in the narrative in ch. 17, if thus David was court musician, though reference is made there to this visit of David to Saul in ver. 15. Possibly, however, David and this youth may have served together in repelling some marauding expedition of the Philistines, and though David may not have actually done much, - nothing, at all events, so well worth repeating to Saul as the combats with the wild beasts, - yet he may have achieved enough to convince his friend that he had in him the qualities of <span class="cmt_word">a man of war,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of a good soldier. For the rest, we must conclude that this first visit of David was a very short one, and that after playing before Saul and being approved of, he then returned home, ready to come again whenever summoned, but that Saul's malady did not immediately return, and so a sufficient interval elapsed for Saul not to recognise him when he saw him under altered circumstances. Saul's question, "Whose son is this stripling?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-56.htm">1 Samuel 17:56</a>) seems to imply that he had a sort of confused idea about him, without being able exactly to recall who he was. The ultimate consequences of this introduction to Saul, as well as its immediate effect, are all narrated here after the usual manner of Old Testament history (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:14-23 Saul is made a terror to himself. The Spirit of the Lord departed from him. If God and his grace do not rule us, sin and Satan will have possession of us. The devil, by the Divine permission, troubled and terrified Saul, by the corrupt humours of his body, and passions of his mind. He grew fretful, peevish, and discontented, and at times a madman. It is a pity that music, which may be serviceable to the good temper of the mind, should ever be abused, to support vanity and luxury, and made an occasion of drawing the heart from God and serious things. That is driving away the good Spirit, not the evil spirit. Music, diversions, company, or business, have for a time often been employed to quiet the wounded conscience; but nothing can effect a real cure but the blood of Christ, applied in faith, and the sanctifying Spirit sealing the pardon, by his holy comforts. All other plans to dispel religious melancholy are sure to add to distress, either in this world or the next.</body></html>
