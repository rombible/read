The command from the Eternal Friend to come and anoint "the son of Jesse of Bethlehem" had been definite, but the sons of Jesse had passed before him, and no sign had been vouch-safed to him indicating that God had chosen one of these youths of whom the father was so fond; so the seer asks, "Are these all thy children?"<p><span class= "bld">There remaineth yet the youngest.</span>--Why David was kept in the background is uncertain. He, clearly, was different to the stalwart band of elder brothers who were grouped round their father. Although fair to look on, his beauty was of a very different type to that of his brothers, probably, compared with Saul and his own brothers, little of stature, with reddish-brown hair and a fair complexion. His father and the men in the village thought less of him than of his dark, tall brothers: at all events, Jesse thought him of too little account to present to Samuel. But, as so often, God's thoughts are not our thoughts, and in a moment Samuel saw that in the ruddy shepherd boy--small of stature, and held of little account in his father's house--he beheld the future king of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are here all thy children?</span> The word literally is lads, <span class="accented">na'arim.</span> The elder sons must have been nearly or quite grown up, but David was probably a mere boy, and as such had not been thought worthy of an invitation, but had been left with the servants keeping the sheep. The prophet now orders him to be summoned, and marks his value in God's sight by saying, <span class="cmt_word">We will not sit down till he come hither.</span> The verb literally means, <span class="accented">we will not surround, i.e.</span> the table, though at this time the Jews did sit at meals, instead of reclining on couches, as in the days of Amos and our Lord. We gather, moreover, from Samuel's words that the selection of the son that was to be anointed took place while the preparations were being made for the feast. At the prophet's command David is fetched from the flock, which was probably near the house, and on his arrival the prophet sees a <span class="cmt_word">ruddy</span> boy, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> red-haired, correctly rendered in the Vulgate <span class="accented">rufus</span>, the colour loved by all painters of manly beauty, and, from the delicacy of complexion which accompanies it, especially admired in the East, where men are generally dark-haired and sallow-faced. Moreover, he was <span class="cmt_word">of a beautiful countenance.</span> The Hebrew says, "with beautiful eyes," and so the Syriac and Septuagint rightly. He was also <span class="cmt_word">goodly to look to,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to look at. These last words give the general idea of the beauty of his face and person, while his bright hair and delicate complexion and the beauty of his eyes are specially noticed in the Hebrew. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-13 It was strange that Samuel, who had been so disappointed in Saul, whose countenance and stature recommended him, should judge of another man by that rule. We can tell how men look, but God can tell what they are. He judges of men by the heart. We often form a mistaken judgment of characters; but the Lord values only the faith, fear, and love, which are planted in the heart, beyond human discernment. And God does not favour our children according to our fond partiality, but often most honours and blesses those who have been least regarded. David at length was pitched upon. He was the youngest of the sons of Jesse; his name signifies Beloved; he was a type of God's beloved Son. It should seem, David was least set by of all the sons of Jesse. But the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. His anointing was not an empty ceremony, a Divine power went with that instituted sign; he found himself advanced in wisdom and courage, with all the qualifications of a prince, though not advanced in his outward circumstances. This would satisfy him that his election was of God. The best evidence of our being predestinated to the kingdom of glory, is, our being sealed with the Spirit of promise, and experience of a work of grace in our hearts.</body></html>
