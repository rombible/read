The great warrior king no doubt fought like a lion, but one by one his brave defenders fell in harness by his side; and the enemy seems to have directed their principal attention, at this period of the fight, to killing or capturing the famous Saul.<p><span class= "bld">And the archers hit him.</span>--It would seem as though, in that deadly combat, none could strike down that giant kingly form, so the archers--literally, as in the margin of our Version, <span class= "ital">shooters, men with bows, </span>skilful shots--were told off, and these, aiming at the warrior towering above the other combatants, with the crown on his head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm" title="So I stood on him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.">2Samuel 1:10</a>), hit him.<p><span class= "bld">And he was sore wounded by the archers.</span>--This is the usual rendering of the word, but the more accurate translation is, <span class= "ital">He was sore afraid </span>(or was greatly alarmed at them): so Gesenius, Keil, Lange, &c. All seemed against him. His army was routed, his sons were dead, his faithful captains and companions were gone, and these bow-men were shooting at him from a distance where his strong arm could not reach them. Gradually weakened through loss of blood--perhaps with the words he had heard only a few hours before at En-dor from the dead prophet ringing in his ears, "To-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me"--the great undaunted courage at last failed him, and he turned to his armourbearer, who was still by his side.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The archers.</span> Literally, as in the margin, "shooters, men with bows." As the first word would equally apply to men who threw javelins, the explanation is added to make the meaning clear. <span class="cmt_word">Hit him.</span> Literally, "found him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> found out his position, and came up to where he was. <span class="cmt_word">He was sore wounded.</span> Rather, "he was sore distressed." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a> the verb is rendered "be in anguish." The meaning is that Saul, finding himself surrounded by these archers, and that he could neither escape nor come to close quarters with them, and die fighting, ordered his armour bearer to kill him, that he might be spared the degradation of being slain by "uncircumcised" heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Abuse me.</span> This verb is translated <span class="accented">mock</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>. "Maltreat" would be a better rendering in both places, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-25.htm">Judges 19:25</a>, where, too, the word occurs. Its exact meaning is to practise upon another all that passion, lust, anger, or malice dictate. Probably Saul thought that they would treat him as they had previously treated Samson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-7 We cannot judge of the spiritual or eternal state of any by the manner of their death; for in that, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked. Saul, when sorely wounded, and unable to resist or to flee, expressed no concern about his never-dying soul; but only desired that the Philistines might not insult over him, or put him to pain, and he became his own murderer. As it is the grand deceit of the devil, to persuade sinners, under great difficulties, to fly to this last act of desperation, it is well to fortify the mind against it, by a serious consideration of its sinfulness before God, and its miserable consequences in society. But our security is not in ourselves. Let us seek protection from Him who keepeth Israel. Let us watch and pray; and take unto us the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</body></html>
