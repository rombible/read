Without comment he copies into his record the hymn of David on Saul and Jonathan, just as he found it in the <span class= "ital">Book of Jashar </span>(the collection of national odes celebrating the heroes of the Theocracy). "There David speaks of the Saul of earlier times--the mighty conqueror, the delight of his people, the father of his beloved and faithful friend--like him in life, united with him in death." (Stanley).<p>"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives<p>And in their death they were not divided.<p>Than eagles they were swifter, than lions more strong."<p>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm" title="Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.">2Samuel 1:23</a>.)

There, it seems, they made the last stand with the <span class= "ital">fideles </span>of the royal house of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-6.htm" title="So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.">1Samuel 31:6</a>), and there, no doubt defending the king to the last, they fell.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-7 We cannot judge of the spiritual or eternal state of any by the manner of their death; for in that, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked. Saul, when sorely wounded, and unable to resist or to flee, expressed no concern about his never-dying soul; but only desired that the Philistines might not insult over him, or put him to pain, and he became his own murderer. As it is the grand deceit of the devil, to persuade sinners, under great difficulties, to fly to this last act of desperation, it is well to fortify the mind against it, by a serious consideration of its sinfulness before God, and its miserable consequences in society. But our security is not in ourselves. Let us seek protection from Him who keepeth Israel. Let us watch and pray; and take unto us the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</body></html>
