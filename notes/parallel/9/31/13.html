The men of Jabesh-Gilead well remembered this peculiar fancy of their dead king, and under the waving branches of their own beautiful and famous tamarisk they tenderly laid the remains of their dead hero and his princely sons.<p>Evidently King David, at a subsequent period, fetched away these royal remains, and had them reverently interred in the family sepulchre of Kish, the father of Saul, in Zelah of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-12.htm" title="And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:">2Samuel 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-14.htm" title="And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.">2Samuel 21:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And fasted seven days.</span>--This was the period the sons of Israel mourned for Jacob at the threshing floor of Atad beyond Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm" title="And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:10</a>). The grateful men of Jabesh-Gilead thus paid the last honours to the fallen Saul.<p>It is probable that the Talmudic rule which enjoins strict mourning for seven days (fasting was mourning of the strictest kind) was originally based on these two historic periods of mourning recorded in the case of the great ancestor of the tribes, Jacob, and of the first King Saul, although the curious tradition preserved in the Babylonian Talmud gives a special reason for the period--seven days. Rav. Chisda said: The soul of the deceased mourns over him <span class= "ital">the first seven days; </span>for it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm" title="But his flesh on him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.">Job 14:22</a>, "and his soul shall mourn over him." Rav. Jehudah said: If there are no mourners to condole with, ten men sit down where the death took place. Such a case happened in the neighbourhood of Rav. Jehudah. <span class= "ital">After the seven days of mourning, </span>the deceased appeared to Rav. Jehudah in a dream, and said <span class= "ital">"</span>Mayest thou be comforted as thou hast comforted me."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>fol. 152, Colossians 2.<p>To this day among the Jews ten men are hired to perform the usual daily prayers during <span class= "ital">the seven days </span>of mourning at the house of the deceased.<p>On the reason for the number <span class= "ital">seven </span>being fixed for the period of mourning, we read again in the <span class= "ital">Seder Moed </span>of the Babylonian Talmud, "How is it proved that mourning should be kept up <span class= "ital">seven days? </span>"It is written, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm" title="And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.">Amos 8:10</a> : "I will turn your feasts into mourning," and these (usually) lasted seven days.--Treatise <span class= "ital">Moed Katon, </span>fol. 20, Colossians 1.<p>"Again a long draught of my soul-wine!

It is of little consequence by what means we die, or what is done with our dead bodies. If our souls are saved, our bodies will be raised incorruptible and glorious; but not to fear His wrath, who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, is the extreme of folly and wickedness. How useless is the respect of fellow-creatures to those who are suffering the wrath of God! While pompous funerals, grand monuments, and he praises of men, honour the memory of the deceased, the soul may be suffering in the regions of darkness and despair! Let us seek that honour which cometh from God only.</body></html>
