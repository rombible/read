<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-6.htm" title="So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.">1Chronicles 10:6</a> explains it by "all his house." Ishbosheth, his son, for instance, and Abner, the captain of the host, we know were not among the slain on that fatal day. The meaning is that all his <span class= "ital">"fideles," </span>his personal staff, as we should say, with his three sons fell fighting round him. The lines of the chivalrous Scottish ballad writer who with rare skill describes the devoted followers of King James V. falling round him at Flodden, well paints what took place on the stricken field of Gilboa round the hero king Saul:--<p>"No one failed him! He is keeping<p>Royal state and semblance still,<p>Knight and noble lie around him,<p>Cold, on Flodden's fatal hill.<p>"Of the brave and gallant-hearted<p>Whom you sent with prayers away,<p>Not a single man departed<p>From his monarch yesterday."

Saul, when sorely wounded, and unable to resist or to flee, expressed no concern about his never-dying soul; but only desired that the Philistines might not insult over him, or put him to pain, and he became his own murderer. As it is the grand deceit of the devil, to persuade sinners, under great difficulties, to fly to this last act of desperation, it is well to fortify the mind against it, by a serious consideration of its sinfulness before God, and its miserable consequences in society. But our security is not in ourselves. Let us seek protection from Him who keepeth Israel. Let us watch and pray; and take unto us the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</body></html>
