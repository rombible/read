The LXX. wrongly render, instead of Gibeah, "on the hills." The margin of the English Version, "under a grove in a high place," is correct as regards the later words, <span class= "ital">baramah </span>signifying here upon the height. "Under a tree" is, however, nearer the original than "under a grove." The literal rendering would be "under a tamarisk tree." The sentence then should run, "Now Saul abode in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the height." The tamarisk, which grows so abundantly on the sea-shore of England and in warmer climates, develops into a very graceful tree, with long feathery branches and tufts. Saul's love for trees has been noticed before. This solemn council of his, when the darkest deed of his reign was decided upon, was held in the spot Saul loved so well, under the spreading tamarisk branches. There we see him, leaning, as was his wont in peace as in war, upon his tall spear, surrounded by his valiant captains, chosen apparently, with one exception, from his own tribe of Benjamin--the exception being his wicked counsellor, the Edomite Doeg, who was over the royal herds. This is one of the earliest councils we have any definite account of in the world's history. The king, surrounded by his chosen "fideles," complaining of the treason of one of them lately exiled from their midst, bewailing the want of fidelity of his son, the heir to the throne--then the stepping forward of one of these "fideles," one invested with high office, and publicly denouncing the chief religious official of the kingdom--forms a striking and vivid picture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Saul heard that David was discovered.</span> Hebrew, "was known." The meaning is easy enough, though rendered obscure by the involved translation of the A.V., and is as follows: When Saul heard that there was information concerning David and his men, he held a solemn council, in which we see how simple was the dignity of his court, but how great the ferocity to which he was now a prey. There is no parenthesis, but the account of Saul taking his seat, surrounded by his officers, follows directly upon the narration of the fact that news of David had reached him, and should be translated thus: "And Saul takes his seat in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height, holding his javelin (as a sceptre) in his hand, and all his officers stand in order by him." For Saul's fondness for trees see ch. 14:2; but at a time when there were no large buildings a branching tree formed a fit place for a numerous meeting. <span class="cmt_word">A tree.</span> Really a tamarisk tree, which "sometimes reaches such a size as to afford dense shade .... It is a very graceful tree, with long feathery branches and tufts, closely clad with the minutest of leaves, and surmounted in spring with spikes of beautiful pink blossom" (Tristram, 'Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 357). It grows abundantly on the seashore of England, but requires a warmer climate to develope into a tree. In Spain beautiful specimens may be seen, as for instance at Pampeluna. <span class="cmt_word">In Ramah.</span> Conder (Handbook) thinks that Gibeah was the name of a district, which included Ramah; others take the word in its original signification, and render "on the height." <span class="cmt_word">Standing</span>. The word means that they took each their proper posts around him (See on 1 Samuel 10:23; 12:7, 16; 17:16). Saul was holding a formal court, to decide what steps should be taken now that David had openly revolted from him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:6-19 See the nature of jealous malice and its pitiful arts. Saul looks upon all about him as his enemies, because they do not just say as he says. In Ahimelech's answer to Saul we have the language of conscious innocence. But what wickedness will not the evil spirit hurry men to when he gets the dominion! Saul alleges that which was utterly false and unproved. But the most bloody tyrants have found instruments of their cruelty as barbarous as themselves. Doeg, having murdered the priests, went to the city, Nob, and put all to the sword there. Nothing so vile but those may do it, who have provoked God to give them up to their hearts' lusts. Yet this was the accomplishment of the threatenings against the house of Eli. Though Saul was unrighteous in doing this, yet God was righteous in permitting it. No word of God shall fall to the ground.</body></html>
