What he--the guardian of the sanctuary--had done, he had done as a matter of course for one so closely related to the king--for one, too, ever loyal and devoted as David had ever proved himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-16.</span> - Ahimelech's answers are those of an innocent man who had supposed that what he did was a matter of course. But his enumeration of David's privileges of rank and station probably only embittered the king. In his eyes David was of all Saul s officers the most <span class="cmt_word">faithful</span>, both trusty and trusted (see on 1 Samuel 2:35). He was, moreover, the <span class="cmt_word">king's son-in-law</span>; but the next words, he <span class="cmt_word">goeth at thy bidding</span>, more probably mean, "has admission to thy audience," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is thy privy councillor, with the right of entering unbidden the royal presence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a>, margin; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-25.htm">1 Chronicles 11:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did I then begin to enquire of God for him?</span> Though the meaning of these words is disputed, yet there seems no sufficient reason for taking them in any other than their natural sense. It was probably usual to consult God by the Urim and Thummim on all matters of importance, and David, as a high officer of Saul's court, must often have done so before starting on such expeditions as are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13</a>. But the Bible is singularly reticent in such matters, and it is only incidentally that we learn how fully the Mosaic law entered into the daily life of the people. But for this frightful crime we should not even have known that Saul had brought the ark into his own neighbourhood, and restored the services of the sanctuary. But just as he took care to have Ahiah in attendance upon him in war, so we cannot doubt but that his main object in placing the priests at Nob was to have the benefit of the Divine counsel in his wars. It would be quite unreasonable to suppose that such consultations required the king's personal attendance. Thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more. Whatever Ahimelech had done had been in perfect good faith, and though David's conduct must have seemed to him suspicious, yet there was nothing that would have justified him in acting differently. Nevertheless, in spite of his transparent innocence, Saul orders the slaughter not only of God's high priest, but of the whole body of the priesthood whom he had placed at Nob, and now had summoned for this ferocious purpose into his presence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:6-19 See the nature of jealous malice and its pitiful arts. Saul looks upon all about him as his enemies, because they do not just say as he says. In Ahimelech's answer to Saul we have the language of conscious innocence. But what wickedness will not the evil spirit hurry men to when he gets the dominion! Saul alleges that which was utterly false and unproved. But the most bloody tyrants have found instruments of their cruelty as barbarous as themselves. Doeg, having murdered the priests, went to the city, Nob, and put all to the sword there. Nothing so vile but those may do it, who have provoked God to give them up to their hearts' lusts. Yet this was the accomplishment of the threatenings against the house of Eli. Though Saul was unrighteous in doing this, yet God was righteous in permitting it. No word of God shall fall to the ground.</body></html>
