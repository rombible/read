David did not send away these refugees, many of them distinguished and prominent Israelites, but organised them into a military force. He foresaw that while commanding such a company as this, he might, without injuring his king and former benefactor, be of the very greatest use to the people, and protect the southern frontiers of the kingdom--sadly exposed in these later years of King Saul--from the plundering incursions of the neighbouring nomadic tribes. This state of things, with a few interruptions, really came to pass, and David won great repute and popularity among the protected districts during these years when he was a wanderer and an outlaw--a popularity which in after years stood him in good stead."<p>These persons "in distress" were especially those who were persecuted by Saul and his men for their attachment to David. The several statements of the refugees who took shelter in David's armed camp, of course go over a considerable time. They did not all flock to his standard at once. Some went to him in the first days of his exile, others after the massacre at the sanctuary at Nob, others later, and thus gradually 400 gathered round him. Soon after, these numbers were swelled to 600, and these probably only were the chosen men-at-arms of the little force, which, no doubt, was numerically far greater.<p><span class= "bld">And every one that was in debt.</span>--Throughout the whole long story of Israel this unhappy love of greed and gain has been a characteristic feature of the chosen race, ever a prominent and ugly sin. In the Mosaic Law, most stringent regulations were laid down to correct and mitigate this ruling passion of avarice among the Jews. (See such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury.">Exodus 22:25</a><span class= "ital">; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm" title="Take you no usury of him, or increase: but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.">Leviticus 25:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-19.htm" title="You shall not lend on usury to your brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent on usury:">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>.) The poor, improvident, or perhaps unfortunate, debtor was protected by wise laws against the greedy avaricious spirit of his merciless creditor. These beneficent regulations of the great lawgiver had, under the capricious, faulty rule of King Saul, of course fallen into abeyance, and a terrible amount of misery, no doubt, was the consequence. In the Divine record sad scenes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2Kings 4:1-7</a>), exemplifying this pitiless spirit, are casually related, but they are so woven into the mosaic of the history, as to show us they were, alas! no uncommon occurrence in the daily life of the people. In Proverbs, for instance, we have some conspicuous instances. The chronicles of the Middle Ages in all countries teem with similar stories about the chosen people. Our own great dramatist, some three centuries ago, evidently without attempt at exaggeration, selects the avaricious, grasping Jew as the central figure of one of his most famous dramas. In our own time the same spirit, as is too well known, is still abroad, and constitutes the bitterest reproach which the many enemies of the strange, deathless race can promulgate against a people evidently walled in by a Divine protection and a changeless eternal love.<p><span class= "bld">And he became a captain over them.</span>--It was evidently no undisciplined band, these outlaws of Adullam and the hold of Moab, of Hareth and Keilah, of Ziph and Engedi. David quickly organised the refugees, among whom, by degrees, many a man of mark and approved valour and ability were numbered.<p>To complete the picture of this First Book of Samuel, we must unite in one the scattered notices of this same period which occur in the Second Book of Samuel and in the Books of Kings and Chronicles. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus I. </span>at the end of this Book.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Everyone that was in distress</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">in debt</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">discontented</span> (Hebrew, bitter of soul), <span class="cmt_word">gathered themselves unto him.</span> Had Saul's government been just and upright David would have had no followers; but he never rose above the level of a soldier, had developed all that arbitrariness which military command fosters in self-willed minds, and seems entirely unaware of its being his duty to attend to the righteous administration of the law. The Israelites had in him the very king they had desired, but they found that a brave general might at home be a ruthless tyrant. Debt was one of the worst evils of ancient times. The rate of usury was so exorbitant that a loan was sure to end in utter ruin, and not only the debtor, but his children might be made slaves to repay the debt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>). It was one of the first duties of an upright governor to enforce the Mosaic law against usury (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36</a>); but all such cares Saul despised, and there were probably many in the land impoverished by Saul's own exactions and favouritism (ver. 7), and made bitter of soul by his cruelty and injustice. All such were glad to join in what seemed to them the banner of revolt. Afterwards at Ziklag David was joined by nobler followers (see on 1 Samuel 27:6). With David we may compare Jephthah's case in the old days of anarchy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3-6</a>), and note that bad government leads to lawlessness just as surely as no government. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 See what weak instruments God sometimes uses, to bring about his own purposes. The Son of David is ready to receive distressed souls, who will be commanded by him. He receives all who come unto Him, however vile and miserable; he changes them into a holy people, and employs them in his service: those who would reign with him must be contented first to suffer with and for him. Observe with what tender concern David provided for his aged parents. The first thing he does is to find them a quiet habitation, whatever became of himself. Let children learn to honour their parents, in every thing consulting their ease and satisfaction. Though highly preferred, and much employed, let them not forget their aged parents. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. And the Lord will preserve his people for their appointed work, however they may be hated and exposed.</body></html>
