He is mentioned as the king's seer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm" title="For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,">2Samuel 24:11</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm" title="Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,">1Chronicles 29:29</a> he appears as the compiler of the acts of David, along with Samuel and Nathan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm" title="And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.">2Chronicles 29:25</a> he is mentioned with his brother prophet Nathan again, as the man who had drawn up the plan of the great Temple services, which have been the model now for eighteen centuries of the countless Christian Liturgies in all the Churches.<p>It was Gad also who, far on in the golden days of the exile's rule, dared to reprove the mighty king for his deed of numbering the people, which act involved a great sin, or the design of a great sin, not recorded for us, and who brought as a message from the Highest the terrible choice of three evils (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm" title="For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,">2Samuel 24:11</a>, and following verses). As he appears in the last years of the great king's life, and apparently survived his master and friend, Gad must have been still young, or at all events in the prime of life, when he joined the fugitive and his outlawed band. He had, therefore, not improbably been a fellow student and friend of David's in the Naioth of Samuel by Ramah. It seems hardly a baseless conjecture which sees in Gad a direct messenger from the old prophet Samuel to his loved pupil David, "the anointed," Samuel well knew, "of the Lord." As has been before observed, among the many who were educated and brought up in the Schools of the Prophets as historians, preachers, musicians, and teachers, but very few seem to have received the Divine influence (the Spirit's "afflatus") which was needed to constitute a prophet in the true high sense of the solemn word as we now understand it. Gad, however, appears to have been one of these rarely favoured few, and the presence of such an one in this outlaw camp of David must have been of great advantage to the captain.<p><span class= "bld">Abide not.</span>--The wise advice of the prophet, suggested by a Divine influence, told David not to estrange himself from his own country and people by remaining in a foreign land, but to return with his followers to the wilder districts of Judah. There was work for him and his followers to do in that distracted, harassed land.<p><span class= "bld">The forest of Hareth.</span>--The LXX. and Josephus here read "the city of Hareth." Lieutenant Conder, whose late investigations have thrown so much light upon the geography of the Promised Land, can find no trace of forest on the edge of the mountain chain of Hebron, where Kharas now stands, and he therefore believes the LXX. text the true one. Dean Payne Smith, however, considers that "the thickets," which still grow here abundantly, are what the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">yar, </span>here translated "forest," signifies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The prophet Gad.</span> This sudden appearance of the prophet suggests Stahelin's question, How came he among such people? But, in the first place, David's followers were not all of the sort described in ver. 2; and, next, this must be regarded as a declaration of the prophetic order in his favour. As we have a summary of David's proceedings in ver. 4, extending over some time, during which the massacre of the priests at Nob took place, we may well suppose that Saul had alienated from him the minds of all religious people, and that Gad, probably by Samuel's command, came to be David's counsellor. The advice he gives is most important - Abide not in the hold. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> do not remain in the land of Moab. Had David done so he probably would never have become king. By remaining in Judah, and protecting the people from the Philistines, which Saul could no longer do, David grew in reputation and power, and from the list of those who joined him at Ziklag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-22</a>) it is evident not only that such was the case, but that there was a strong enthusiasm for him throughout not merely Judah, but all Israel. In the happier times which followed Gad became David's seer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11</a>), was God's messenger to punish David for numbering the people (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 13), and finally wrote a history of his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>). As he thus survived David, he must have been a young man when he joined him, and possibly had been a companion of David in the prophetic schools at Naioth in Ramah. <span class="cmt_word">The forest of Hareth.</span> Or, rather, Hereth. "This lay on the edge of the mountain chain (of Hebron), where Kharas now stands, surrounded by the thickets which properly represent the Hebrew <span class="accented">yar</span>, a word wrongly supposed to mean a woodland of timber trees" (Conder, 'Tent Work,' 2:88). <span class="accented">Yar</span> is translated forest here. Hereth was about three miles from Adullam (see on ver. 1). MASSACRE OF THE PRIESTS AT NOB (vers. 6-19). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 See what weak instruments God sometimes uses, to bring about his own purposes. The Son of David is ready to receive distressed souls, who will be commanded by him. He receives all who come unto Him, however vile and miserable; he changes them into a holy people, and employs them in his service: those who would reign with him must be contented first to suffer with and for him. Observe with what tender concern David provided for his aged parents. The first thing he does is to find them a quiet habitation, whatever became of himself. Let children learn to honour their parents, in every thing consulting their ease and satisfaction. Though highly preferred, and much employed, let them not forget their aged parents. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. And the Lord will preserve his people for their appointed work, however they may be hated and exposed.</body></html>
