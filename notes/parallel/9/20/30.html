Probably he had determined at that very feast, surrounded by his own devoted friends and members of his family, to carry out his evil designs against David's life.<p>Murder was, probably enough, one of the incidents arranged for at that banquet, but the absence of the intended victim marred the plot; besides which, the king, too, with the cunning which the partially insane so often display, saw through the veil of the specious excuse that David too clearly suspected his wicked design, and purposely stayed away; nay, more, that his own son Jonathan, the heir of his kingdom, suspected him, and openly sympathised with his friend David, for whose pointed absence he thus publicly apologised.<p><span class= "bld">Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman.</span>--These words, spoken in public, in any sense were a bitter insult to the prince. Another and better rendering has, however, been suggested. The word <span class= "ital">na?vath, </span>rendered <span class= "ital">perverse, </span>instead of being a feminine adjective, is probably an abstract noun. The translation would then run, "Thou son of perversity of rebellion," a common Hebraism for "a man of perverse and refractory nature;" so Clericus, Lange, and Payne Smith. This avoids the extreme improbability that Saul insulted his <span class= "ital">own </span>wife, Jonathan's mother, which, as has been observed, contradicts the Hebrew family spirit.<p><span class= "bld">The confusion of thy mother's nakedness.</span>--This is far from insulting Jonathan's mother; it is simply an Oriental mode of saying, "she will feel ashamed at having brought such a son into the world."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman</span>. Literally, "thou son of one perverse in rebellion." In the East it is the greatest possible insult to a man to call his mother names; but the word rendered <span class="accented">perverse</span>, instead of being a feminine adjective, is probably an abstract noun, and "son of perversity of rebellion" would mean one who was thoroughly perverse in his resistance to his father's will. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> thy mother will feel ashamed and disgraced at having borne such a son. <span class="cmt_word">He shall surely die.</span> Hebrew, "he is a son of death," <span class="accented">son</span>, being constantly used in Hebrew to express qualities, or, as here, the fate to which a man is destined. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:24-34 None were more constant than David in attending holy duties; nor had he been absent, but self-preservation obliged him to withdraw. In great peril present opportunities for Divine ordinances may be waved. But it is bad for us, except in case of necessity, to omit any opportunity of statedly attending on them. Jonathan did wisely and well for himself and family, to secure an interest in David, yet for this he is blamed. It is good to take God's people for our people. It will prove to our advantage at last, however it may now be thought against our interest. Saul was outrageous. What savage beasts, and worse, does anger make men!</body></html>
