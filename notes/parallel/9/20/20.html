It was a very simple one, and seems to speak of very early primitive times. Jonathan slightly varies from his original purpose. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm" title="And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not to you, and show it you;">1Samuel 20:12</a> it seems as though he meant to have sent a special messenger had the news been good, but now the arrangement is that in either event he should come himself out from the city into the solitary valley where it was agreed David should remain in hiding by the stone "Ezel." Dean Payne Smith rather strangely conceives that the arrows of the "sign" were to be aimed at the stone Ezel, but the description points to the "mark" as situated on the side of "Ezel," in or behind which David was to be concealed.<p>The prince agreed that after the feast he would leave the city, as though about to practise shooting at a mark, and that he would bring with him a servant--probably-one of his young armour-bearers--when, at the spot agreed upon in the neighbourhood of David's place of concealment near Ezel, he would post his servant in his place as marker, and then would shoot. After shooting, he would call out to his attendant, "the arrows are on this side of thee" (that is, between the mark and Jonathan himself), then David would know all was well; but if he cried "the arrows are beyond thee," that is, on the further side of the mark, David would understand that all was over, and that he must fly. Jonathan evidently took these precautions not knowing whether or no he would be accompanied by friends of his father from the city, in which case the "sign" agreed upon would be sufficient to tell David what had happened at the feast. As it turned out, Jonathan was able to escape observation, and to go alone with his servant to the place of meeting. He used the sign to attract his friend's attention, and then followed the last sorrowful parting, told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/20-41.htm" title="And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.">1Samuel 20:41-42</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - The two friends now agree upon the sign. Jonathan was to shoot three arrows at this stone, Ezel, as his mark, and was then to send his servant to gather them up. When he bad gone some distance Jonathan was to shout to him, loud enough for David to hear. If Jonathan said that the arrows were on that side the mark, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> between it and Jonathan, David was to come forth boldly, as all was well. But if Jonathan said that the arrows were further on, then David must understand that he was to seek safety in flight. For <span class="cmt_word">there is peace to thee, and no hurt,</span> the Hebrew has "there is peace to thee, and it is nothing," a simpler and more idiomatic rendering. As touching the matter, etc. Rather, "As for the word that we have spoken, I and thou, behold, Jehovah is between me and thee forever." The <span class="accented">word</span> was the bond and covenant by which they had pledged their truth to one another. Though separated, their love was to continue, and Jehovah was to be their eternal centre of union, and the witness to their covenant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:11-23 Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!</body></html>
