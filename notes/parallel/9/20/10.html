Evidently the very words uttered in the memorable scene by the excited and sorrowful friends are remembered and reported.<p>The "if" supplied in the English Version probably is nearest the meaning intended to be conveyed by the broken, agitated words. Another rendering is, "If thy father shall answer thee harshly, who will declare it to me?"<p>"These questions of David were suggested by a correct estimate of the circumstances--namely, that Saul's suspicions would lead him to the conclusion that there was some understanding between Jonathan and David, and that he would take steps, in consequence, to prevent Jonathan from making David acquainted with the result of his conversation with Saul."--<span class= "ital">Keil.</span><p>In the next verse Jonathan leads David into a solitary spot--"the field"--where, before saying their last words together, they might agree upon some secret sign by means of which Saul's real mind towards David might be communicated, if necessary, by Jonathan to his friend.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who shall tell me? or what if,</span> etc. The <span class="accented">if</span> is an insertion of the A.V. Really David's question is very involved and ungrammatical, as was natural in his excited state. It may be translated, "Who will tell me (or, how shall I know) what rough answer thy father will give thee?" But some Jewish authorities render, "Who will tell me if so be that thy father give thee a rough answer?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-10 The trials David met with, prepared him for future advancement. Thus the Lord deals with those whom he prepares unto glory. He does not put them into immediate possession of the kingdom, but leads them to it through much tribulation, which he makes the means of fitting them for it. Let them not murmur at his gracious appointment, nor distrust his care; but let them look forward with joyful expectation to the crown which is laid up for them. Sometimes it appears to us that there is but a step between us and death; at all times it may be so, and we should prepare for the event. But though dangers appear most threatening, we cannot die till the purpose of God concerning us is accomplished; nor till we have served our generation according to his will, if we are believers. Jonathan generously offers David his services. This is true friendship. Thus Christ testifies his love to us, Ask, and it shall be done for you; and we must testify our love to him, by keeping his commandments.</body></html>
