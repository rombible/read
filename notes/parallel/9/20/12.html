The vocative, however, "O Lord God," &c., of the English Version has been generally looked upon as an impossible rendering--"there being no analogy for such a mode of address"--<span class= "ital">Lange.</span><p>The versions avoid it by supplying different words. So the Syriac and Arabic render "The Lord of Israel is <span class= "ital">my witness"</span>; the LXX., "The Lord God of Israel knows." Others have supplied a word which they find in two Hebrew MSS., "As the Lord God of Israel <span class= "ital">liveth." </span>The meaning, however, is perfectly clear.<p><span class= "bld">Or the third day.--</span>This statement of time on the part of Jonathan evidently assumes that the festival was continued the day after the "new moon" by a royal banquet. The time is thus reckoned: the present day; the morrow, which was the new moon festival; and the day after, which would reckon as the third day.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, if there be good toward David.</span>--In the event of the news being good--that is, if Saul, contrary to David's expectation, spoke kindly of him--then Jonathan would <span class= "ital">send </span>to him a special messenger; if, on the other hand, the king displayed enmity, in that case Jonathan would come himself and see David (for the last time). This sad message should be brought by no messenger.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:11-23 Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!</body></html>
