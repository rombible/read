The Chaldee, Arabic, and Syriac here interpret rather than translate, "on the third day thou will be missed the more." "It did not matter," writes the Dean, "whether David went fast or slow, as he was to hide there some time, but it was important that David should be far away, so that no prying eye might chance to catch sight of him."<p><span class= "bld">When the business was in hand.</span>--The expression, <span class= "ital">b'yom hamma?seh, </span>rendered in our version by "when the business was <span class= "ital">in hand," </span>is one hard to understand. Perhaps the best translation is that adopted by Gesenius, De Wette, and Maurer, who render it quite literally "on the day of the deed," and understand by "deed" King Saul's design of killing David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-2.htm" title="But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, I pray you, take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide yourself:">1Samuel 19:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">By the stone Ezel.</span>--This stone, or cairn, or possibly ruin, is mentioned nowhere else. Some have supposed it to have been a road-stone, or stone guide-post. The following ingenious conjecture is hazarded in the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary:--"</span>The LXX. here, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-41.htm" title="And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.">1Samuel 20:41</a> (where the spot, but not the stone, is spoken of), read <span class= "ital">argab, </span>or <span class= "ital">ergab, </span>a word meaning <span class= "ital">a heap of stones. </span>If this is the true reading, David's hiding place was either a natural cavernous rock, which was called <span class= "ital">argab, </span>or some ruin of an ancient building equally suited for a hiding place." Ewald, slightly changing the text, understands the word as signifying "the lonely waste."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:11-23 Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!</body></html>
