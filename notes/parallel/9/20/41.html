[The "arrow" sign would have been enough to have warned David; and had he not seen that Jonathan was alone and waiting for him, David would, from his place of hiding, have made his escape unseen.] The Chaldee here reads, "from the stone of the sign (or the stone Atha) which is on the south;" the LXX.
