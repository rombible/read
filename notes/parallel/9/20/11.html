And there Jonathan binds himself with a solemn oath, if Saul's intentions be good, to send a trusty messenger to inform David, but if there be danger, then to come and tell David himself. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord God.</span> With a few MSS. we must supply the usual formula of an oath: "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth." <span class="cmt_word">About tomorrow any time, or the third day.</span> This cumbrous translation arose out of the mistaken idea that the word rendered <span class="cmt_word">tomorrow</span> could only be used in that limited sense. Strictly it signifies the <span class="accented">morning</span>, and is applicable to any morrow. Jonathan fixes one time, and one only, and the passage should be rendered, "By this time on the third morrow." The meeting was to be on the morrow after the second day of the festival, and so on the third morrow after the conversation. The whole may be translated, "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, when by this time on the third morrow I have searched my father, and, behold, there be good for David, if then I send not to thee, and uncover thy ear, Jehovah do so and much more to Jonathan." The alternative case is then put, and if the news be evil, Jonathan undertakes himself to be the messenger, and David is to provide for his safety by flight. The concluding prayer that Jehovah might be with David as he had been with Saul contains the same presentiment of David attaining to great power and dignity which is more directly expressed in the following verses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:11-23 Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!</body></html>
