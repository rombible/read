For <span class="cmt_word">when thou hast stayed three days</span>, at which all the versions stumble, a slight alteration gives the right sense: "And on the third day." David on the third day was to <span class="cmt_word">go down quickly</span> - Hebrew, "greatly, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he was to go a long way down into the valley. The rendering <span class="accented">quickly</span> is taken from the Vulgate, but makes no sense. It did not matter whether David went fast or slow, as he was to hide there for some time, but it was important that David should be far away, so that no prying eye might chance to catch sight of him. <span class="cmt_word">When the business was in hand.</span> Literally, "the day of the business," probably that narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-2.htm">1 Samuel 19:2-7</a>. The Septuagint, Vulgate, and Chaldee all understand "a working day," in opposition to a feast day; but "where thou didst hide thyself on a week day" gives no intelligible meaning. By the stone Ezel. As the name Ezel is formed from a verb signifying <span class="accented">to go</span>, some understand by it a <span class="accented">road stone</span>, a stone to mark the way. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:11-23 Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!</body></html>
