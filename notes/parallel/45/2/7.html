But unto them which are contentious</span> (so Authorized Version; in Revised Version, <span class="accented">factious.</span> As to true meaning, see below), <span class="cmt_word">and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth</span> (rather, <span class="accented">worketh</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>, with reference again to <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 6) <span class="cmt_word">evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile</span> (literally, <span class="accented">Greek</span>). The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is rendered in the Authorized Version "them which are contentious," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> being translated "contention" also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm">Philippians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14, 16</a>. So, too, the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui sunt ex contentione</span>; and similarly Origen, Chrysostom, OEcumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Calvin, etc. This, however, is not the classical sense of the word, which is not connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("strife"), but with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which means originally a day labourer, or a worker for hire, being so used in Homer. Hence <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> meant <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> labour for wages, and came to mean <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> canvassing or intriguing for office, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> faction, or party-spirit (cf. Arist., 'Pol.,' 5. 2, 6; 3, 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Notwithstanding the weight of ancient authority for its bearing the sense of "contention" in the New Testament, that of "faction" seems more likely and suitable in the passages where it occurs; and certainly so here, the idea seeming to be that the persons spoken of <span class="accented">factiously</span> renounced their allegiance to "the truth," obeying <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> instead. We observe how expressions are here heaped up, significant of the Divine indignation against high-handed sin, unrepented and unatoned for, of which the apostle, in very virtue of his view of the eternal <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, had an awful sense (see above on Romans 1:18; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, etc.; and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). Still, neither this verse nor ver. 5 is of necessity inconsistent with other well-known passages, where St. Paul seems to contemplate God's reconciliation in the end of <span class="accented">all things</span> to himself in Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). The "indignation and wrath" spoken of in the passages before us (being, as was said under Romans 1:18, inseparable from a full conception of the eternal righteousness) may still be conceived as having a corrective as well as a punitive purpose. Nor is the doctrine which has been called that of "eternal hope" of necessity precluded by statements which imply no more than that sin, unrepented and unatoned for, must inevitably undergo its doom in the unknown regions of <span class="accented">eternity.</span> The thought, at the end of ver. 9, for the first time passes distinctly to the <span class="accented">Jew's</span> assumed exemption from the condemnation of the rest of mankind; and to this exclusively the remainder of the chapter is devoted. The "indignation," etc., it is said, will be upon the <span class="accented">Jew first</span> (cf. ch. 1:16), which may mean either <span class="accented">in the first instance</span>, or <span class="accented">principally.</span> His priority in Divine favor involves priority in retribution, while his pre-eminence in privilege carries with it corresponding responsibility (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>-8 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). Then in ver. 10 a like priority is assigned to the Jew with respect to reward, the general assertion of ver. 7 being repeated (with some differ-once of expression) in order to complete the view of his prior position in both respects. For the covenant was with the Jews; the promises were to them: the Gentiles were as the wild olive tree, grafted in, and made partakers of the root and fatness of the olive tree (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>). "Judaei particeps Graecus" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-16 The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privileges by right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.</body></html>
