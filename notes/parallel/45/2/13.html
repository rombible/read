It has, therefore, been rendered above simply as Law, not as either <span class="accented">the law</span>, or <span class="accented">a law</span>, as the same word will be below, whenever it stands by itself without either the article or any modifying genitive. Much has been written by commentators on the senses in which this word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is to be understood, as used by St. Paul with or without the article. In an Appendix to the Introduction to the Epistle to the Romans in the 'Speaker's Commentary' will be found a summary of the views taken by critics of repute, with exhaustive references to the usage of the word in the Septuagint, in the New Testament generally, and in the writings of St. Paul. It has not been thought necessary in this Commentary to discuss further what has been so amply discussed already. It may suffice to state certain principles for the reader's guidance, which appear plainly to commend themselves to acceptance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f49;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, with the article prefixed, always means the Mosaic Law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, without the article, may have, and often has, specific reference to the Mosaic Law; but, if so, the emission of the article is not arbitrary, but involves a difference of meaning. The article in Greek is prefixed to a word when the latter is intended to convey some definite idea already familiarized to the mind, and "the natural effect of its presence is to divert the thoughts from dwelling on the peculiar import of the word, and is adverse to its inherent notion standing out as a prominent point in the sense of the passage" (quoted from 'Grammar of the New Testament Dialect,' by T. S. Green, in Appendix to Introduction to Romans in the 'Speaker's Commentary '). Hence the omission of the article, where it might have been used, before a word has often the effect of emphasizing and drawing attention to the <span class="accented">inherent notion</span> of the word. We may take as an instance ver. 17 in this chapter, where the Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> but where the preferable reading omits the article. In either case the Mosaic Law is referred to; but the omission of the article brings into prominence the <span class="accented">principle</span> of justification on which the Jew rested - viz. <span class="accented">Law</span>, which exacts entire obedience. In the following verse (the eighteenth), in the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> the article is inserted, the intention being simply to say that the Jew was instructed in the well-known Law of Moses. The same difference of meaning is intimated by the omission or insertion of the article in ver. 23 and elsewhere in other parts of the chapter and of the whole Epistle (see especially ch. 7.). The apostle, who, however spontaneous and unstudied might be his style of writing, by no means used phrases at random, would not surely have thus varied his expressions so often in one and the same sentence without intended significance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> without the article seems evidently in many passages to be used by St. Paul to denote law in the abstract, without any exclusive reference to the Mosaic Law at all, or to any particular code of law. Doubtless the Mosaic Law, in which he had been educated, and which he had painfully proved the impossibility of keeping perfectly, had been to him the grand embodiment and representative of law; but he had hence been led to an abstract conception, ever before his mind, of law as representing the principle of exaction of full obedience to requirements; and when he says, as he so often does, that by law no man can be justified, he means that none can be so on the principle of complete conformity being required to the behests of Divine righteousness, whether as revealed from Mount Sinai or through the human conscience, or in any other way; for by law is the knowledge of sin and consequent guilt, but not the power of avoiding sin. Those who ignore the distinction as above explained, saying, as some do, that <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whether with or without the article, always means simply the Law of Moses, fail to enter into the depth and generality of the apostle's argument. The distinction will be observed in this translation throughout the Epistle (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being translated "the Law," and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> "law"), and it will be found always to have a meaning. (For one instance in which it is hardly possible to suppose St. Paul to have omitted and inserted the article in the same sentence without a meaning, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-16 The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privileges by right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.</body></html>
