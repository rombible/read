This is certainly the last offence of which we should have expected the Jews of this date to be guilty, knowing the scrupulousness with which they shunned all contact with idolatry. They may, however, have thought the idol temples fair plunder. At any rate, it is clear that this charge was commonly brought against them. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-37.htm" title="For you have brought here these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.">Acts 19:37</a>, where the town-clerk of Ephesus specially acquits St. Paul and his companions of "being robbers of temples." Josephus also (<span class= "ital">Ant. iv.</span> 8, ? 10) quotes as a precept of the Mosaic legislation, "Let no one blaspheme those gods which other cities esteem such; nor may any one steal what belongs to strange temples; nor take away the gifts that are dedicated to any god."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</span> The word (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) thus rendered in the Authorized Version means literally "robbest temples," though it may bear also the general meaning of "sacrilege." Commentators differ as to what is meant. Some, considering that the word would not have been used except to denote something really sacrilegious - some offence against true sanctity - refer it to the withholding of gifts and offerings from the temple at Jerusalem, or of tithes from the priests, or embezzlement of the temple revenues. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>, etc., is adduced in illustration, "Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings," etc. (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7-14</a>). A passage also is quoted from Josephus, 'Archaeol.,' B. 18, c. 5, where certain Jews are said to have appropriated to their own use purple and gold which had been given to them for the temple at Jerusalem by one Fulvia, a proselyte of theirs at Rome, in consequence of which the Emperor Tiberius, having been informed of the transaction by the lady's husband, had banished all the Jews from Rome. Others take the word in a general sense to denote any profanation of sanctity. So Luther, Calvin ("profanatio divinae majestatis"), and Bengel ("sacrilegium committi's, quia Deo non das gloriam, quae proprie Dei est"). Inasmuch, however, as definite malpractices of the Jews at that time, on account of which the name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles (ver. 24), seem to be here alluded to, the word may, perhaps more probably, be understood in its proper sense of <span class="accented">plundering temples</span>, meaning heathen temples - a practice which Jewish zealots, in their professed abhorrence of idolatry, might be addicted to when they had opportunity. A writer, though himself attaching no idea of sanctity to such temples, might still use the current term <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. SO, among the ancients, Chrysostom and Theophylact understand it; the latter, however, limiting it to taking away the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> He says, "For if they did abhor the idols, yet nevertheless, dominated by covetousness, they touched the idol-offerings for filthy lucre's sake." In doing this, he seems to imply, they broke the very Law which had enjoined their ancestors to "destroy the altars, and break down the images" of idolaters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>); for the sauna Law had forbidden them to "desire the silver and gold that is on them," or "take it unto thee, for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). A strong confirmation of the view that plundering of heathen temples is denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-37.htm">Acts 19:37</a>, when the town-clerk of Ephesus defended the Christians against the popular fury by declaring that they were not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, that is (as he might mean) not temple-plunderers, such as ordinary Jews had the reputation of being. It has been objected against this view that there is a lack of recorded instances of such temple-plundering on the part of Jews, and that they could not have had much chance, as things then were, of thus displaying their zeal. But there may have been instances, notorious at the time, though not recorded; and, if so, the drift may be, "Thou displayest thy abhorrence of idolatry, enjoined by the Law, by acts of violence and greed, such as the very Law forbids." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-24 The apostle directs his discourse to the Jews, and shows of what sins they were guilty, notwithstanding their profession and vain pretensions. A believing, humble, thankful glorying in God, is the root and sum of all religion. But proud, vain-glorious boasting in God, and in the outward profession of his name, is the root and sum of all hypocrisy. Spiritual pride is the most dangerous of all kinds of pride. A great evil of the sins professors is, the dishonour done to God and religion, by their not living according to their profession. Many despise their more ignorant neighbours who rest in a dead form of godliness; yet themselves trust in a form of knowledge, equally void of life and power, while some glory in the gospel, whose unholy lives dishonour God, and cause his name to be blasphemed.</body></html>
