At the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a> is an accusative "(he will render) eternal life;" here we have the nominative, "(there shall be) tribulation and anguish."<p><span class= "bld">That are contentious.</span>--An error in the Authorised version through a wrong derivation of the word. Strictly, <span class= "ital">To those who act in the spirit of a hireling;</span> hence, according to the secondary meaning of the word, "to those who act in a spirit of factiousness and self-seeking." It is, however, quite possible that the mistaken derivation may have been current in St. Paul's time, as it was, no doubt, somewhat later, from Origen downwards. St. Paul, it is true, distinguishes between the proper word for "contention" and that used here (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>), but this would not exclude, it would rather seem to imply, not indeed a formal derivation, but some association of ideas. The shade of meaning will, perhaps, be expressed if we translate by some such word as "factiousness." So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm" title="The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:">Philippians 1:16</a> (properly <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm" title="But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.">Philippians 1:17</a>, the order of the clauses being reversed), "the one (<span class= "ital">the other</span>) preach Christ of factiousness."<p><span class= "bld">Indignation and wrath.</span>--The Greek equivalents for these two words are distinguished as the settled angry feeling from the passionate outbreak of anger.<p><span class= "bld">The</span> <span class= "bld">truth.</span>--Here used in a moral sense, as almost equivalent to "rectitude," "that which is right." There is a tendency towards this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>, "Who hold down the truth in unrighteousness," though there "the truth" appears to mean rather "natural religion" in general. The ethical sense comes out clearly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>, "he that doeth truth," opposed to "he that doeth evil." These phrases, "obey the truth," "obey unrighteousness," in a plainer style, would be simply "do good," "do evil." It may be noted that St. Paul is fond of these quasi-personifications.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-16 The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privileges by right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.</body></html>
