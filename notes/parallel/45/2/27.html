In these two concluding verses we observe the double sense in which the term <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be used. It denotes here one possessed of the true spirit of Judaism; in which sense the Gentile might be the better Jew. In a like double sense we may use the word "Christian" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham;" also ch. 4. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>). So, too, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> for spiritual circumcision (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), in the sense of inward dedication to God's service, and "<span class="accented">putting</span> off the body of the sins of the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2, 3</a>). Such ethical significance of the rite appears even in the Old Testament. We read there of "uncircumcised lips" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12, 30</a>), or "ears" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>), or "hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a> we find the significant words." The LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy <span class="accented">seed</span>, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, "<span class="accented">Circumcise</span> yourselves to the Loan, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem." (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, "<span class="accented">Put</span> on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.") <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:25-29 No forms, ordinances, or notions can profit, without regenerating grace, which will always lead to seeking an interest in the righteousness of God by faith. For he is no more a Christian now, than he was really a Jew of old, who is only one outwardly: neither is that baptism, which is outward in the flesh: but he is the real Christian, who is inwardly a true believer, with an obedient faith. And the true baptism is that of the heart, by the washing of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Ghost; bringing a spiritual frame of mind, and a willing following of truth in its holy ways. Let us pray that we may be made real Christians, not outwardly, but inwardly; in the heart and spirit, not in the letter; baptized, not with water only, but with the Holy Ghost; and let our praise be, not of men, but of God.</body></html>
