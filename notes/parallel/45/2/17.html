For "behold," a decisive consensus of the best MSS. has "but if." The corruption was very obvious and easy.

The connecting particle "therefore" at the beginning of the same verse is merely resumptive, or, as it is technically called, "epanaleptic."<p>Turning to the Jew, the Apostle breaks out into indignant and vehement apostrophe, "If you have the name of Jew, and repose upon the Law, and make your boast in God, and do all these other things--why then, while you profess to teach others, do you not teach yourself?" A fine specimen of the natural eloquence which the Apostle derives from intense feeling.

The Israelites who had remained in Palestine, or who returned to it after the Captivity, seem thenceforth to have been designated <span class="accented">Jews</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, though they included some of other tribes than that of Judah, notably that of Benjamin, of which St. Paul himself was, and of course of Levi. They are so called, whether resident in Palestine or elsewhere, throughout the New Testament, as well as by Roman writers. the term <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> being applied in the New Testament (usually at least) to distinguish those Jews who adhered to the Hebrew language in public worship, and to national customs and traditions, from those who <span class="accented">Hellenized</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). It was the name on which the people prided themselves at that time, as expressing their peculiar privileges. The apostle, having at the beginning of this chapter addressed himself generally to "whosoever thou art that judgest," now summons the Jew exclusively to the bar of judgment, whose claims to exemption from the general condemnation have come to the front in the preceding verses. By the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, he calls on him now to give an account of himself, and justify his pretensions if he can. The point of the argument is that the Jews were notoriously at that time no better than other nations in moral conduct - nay, their national character was such as to bring their very religion into disrepute among the heathen - and therefore <span class="accented">doing</span>, and not either privilege, knowledge, or profession, being according to the very <span class="accented">Law</span> on which they rested the test required, their whole ground for national exemption was taken away. <span class="cmt_word">And retest on law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, here without the article, so as to emphasize the <span class="accented">principle</span> on which the Jew professed to rest for acceptance), <span class="cmt_word">and makest thy boast of God</span>. The Jew gloried, as against the heathen, in his knowledge and worship of the one true God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-24 The apostle directs his discourse to the Jews, and shows of what sins they were guilty, notwithstanding their profession and vain pretensions. A believing, humble, thankful glorying in God, is the root and sum of all religion. But proud, vain-glorious boasting in God, and in the outward profession of his name, is the root and sum of all hypocrisy. Spiritual pride is the most dangerous of all kinds of pride. A great evil of the sins professors is, the dishonour done to God and religion, by their not living according to their profession. Many despise their more ignorant neighbours who rest in a dead form of godliness; yet themselves trust in a form of knowledge, equally void of life and power, while some glory in the gospel, whose unholy lives dishonour God, and cause his name to be blasphemed.</body></html>
