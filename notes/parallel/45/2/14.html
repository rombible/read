The "for" at the beginning of ver. 14 connects it with the preceding one thus: "Not <span class="accented">hearers</span> but <span class="accented">doers</span> of law will be justified." The Jew, therefore, has no advantage in the way of justification over the Gentile from being in a peculiar sense a <span class="accented">hearer. For</span> Gentiles also may be <span class="accented">doers</span>, though not of a positive revealed law, yet of the law of conscience. It is not, of course, implied that on the <span class="accented">ground</span> of any such <span class="accented">doing</span> they "shall be justified;" only that, so far as they <span class="accented">do</span>, they will, equally with the Jews, be rewarded. Nor is it said that any, in fact, do <span class="accented">all</span> that law enjoins. We observe the hypothetical form of expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc7;</span>, and also, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any of the Law's requirements. The Law, for instance, says, "Thou shalt not steal;" and if a Gentile, though knowing nothing of the ten commandments, on principle refrains from stealing, his conscientious honesty will have its own reward as much as that of the Jew who refrains in obedience to the revealed commandment. A few of the expressions in these verses call for consideration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, said to be "written in their hearts"? <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> cannot be pleonastic, as supposed by Tholuck. One view is that it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which is an expression frequently used elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2, 5, 10</a>); and the singular number has been explained as <span class="accented">collective</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4</a>, and ver. 7 above (so Meyer), or as "<span class="accented">applying</span> to each of the particular cases supposed in the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (so Alford). The objection to this view is that it is not the <span class="accented">works</span> of the Law that can be said to be <span class="accented">written</span>, but rather the Law itself from which the works proceed. Seeing that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> implies evident reference to the tables of the Law, it seems best to take <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as denoting the <span class="accented">efficacy</span> of the Law, as opposed to the <span class="accented">letter</span>, which alone was written on the tables. So in effect Bengel: "Legem ipsam cum sua activitate. Opponitur literae, quae est accidens." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> How do they <span class="accented">show</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) this <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>? Evidently, from the context of ver. 14, by <span class="accented">doing</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> doing them (as is, of course, implied) as being the <span class="accented">right</span> things to do, and approving them. The very possibility of their doing this is evidence of an innate moral sense in the human heart, which, however it may often be obscured or perverted, remains as a characteristic of humanity, and is more or less operative in all communities. "Nulls enim gens unquam sic ab humanitate abhorruit ut non se intra leges aliquas contineret. Constat absque dubio quasdam justitiae et rectitudinis conceptiones, quas Graeci <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> recant, hominum animis esse naturaliter ingenitas" (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> What is exactly meant by the <span class="accented">conscience</span> witnessing, and the <span class="accented">thoughts</span> accusing or else excusing? <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is not the Law in the heart, but rather our <span class="accented">consciousness</span>, whereby wittingly, in accordance with that Law, we approve or condemn. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> seems to denote a <span class="accented">joint</span> witness of conscience. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a> and Romans 9:1, where alone the word occurs elsewhere, it is followed by a dative, and means certainly <span class="accented">concurrent</span> witness. But, if so here, with what? Probably with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> already spoken cf. Right conduct on principle, and conscience approving, witness together to the inward law; or, conduct and conscience together witness to a man's merits or demerits in accordance with that law. Then, what is added about the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> shows how conscience operates. Reason comes into play, evoked by conscience, to reflect on its witness, and definitely condemn or approve what has been done. A kind of court of judicature is supposed. Man calls himself to the bar of his own moral judgment; his conscience adduces witness to the character of his deeds, or rather, with his deeds bears witness for or against himself; his thoughts are as advocates on both sides, arguing for condemnation or acquittal. "Observa quam erudite describat conscientiam, quum dicit nobis venire in mentem rationes, quibus quod recte factum est defendimus; rursum quae nos flagitiorum accusent et redarguant" (Calvin). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-16 The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privileges by right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.</body></html>
