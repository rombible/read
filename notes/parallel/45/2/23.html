There is a certain force in this view, but the structure of the clause is so similar to those that have gone before that it seems best, perhaps, upon the whole, to take it in the ordinary way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou that makest thy boast in law, through thy transgression of the Law dishonourest thou God?</span> (or, <span class="accented">thou dishonourest God</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, as it is written</span>. The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>, where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>. The passage is not quoted as a prophecy now fulfilled, or as in its original reference exactly applicable, but only as serving to express well how the character of the Jews had brought their very religion into disrepute (el. Tacitus, 'Hist..' 5:4, etc.). The remainder of the chapter is devoted to a clear and final exposition of the principle, involved throughout all the previous verses, that Jewish privileges were of no profit in themselves, or without their meaning and purpose being understood and acted on. The thought now passes exclusively to circumcision, as being the original token of the covenant, and the Jew's rite of initiation into his whole privileged position (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>.). When <span class="accented">Jew</span> had come to be the peculiar designation of the children of the covenant, persons were said to become <span class="accented">Jews</span> by circumcision. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>, "And many of the people of the land became Jews," where the LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It may be here observed that the known fact of other races as well as the Jews having practised, and still practising, circumcision is not subversive of the scriptural view of its being a peculiarly Jewish rite. For to the Jew alone it had a peculiar significance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-24 The apostle directs his discourse to the Jews, and shows of what sins they were guilty, notwithstanding their profession and vain pretensions. A believing, humble, thankful glorying in God, is the root and sum of all religion. But proud, vain-glorious boasting in God, and in the outward profession of his name, is the root and sum of all hypocrisy. Spiritual pride is the most dangerous of all kinds of pride. A great evil of the sins professors is, the dishonour done to God and religion, by their not living according to their profession. Many despise their more ignorant neighbours who rest in a dead form of godliness; yet themselves trust in a form of knowledge, equally void of life and power, while some glory in the gospel, whose unholy lives dishonour God, and cause his name to be blasphemed.</body></html>
