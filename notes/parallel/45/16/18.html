It is not, however, quite clear that the class of persons intended is precisely the same. There the Apostle is condemning Antinomian extravagances which professed to be based on his own teaching; here he would seem to have in view some more radical divergence of doctrine, "contrary to" that which they had learned. Selfish indulgence is unfortunately a common goal, to which many diverse ways of error will be found to lead.<p><span class= "bld">By good words and fair speeches.</span>--The difference, perhaps, is between "insinuating" or "specious" address, and "fine phrases" in a rhetorical sense.<p><span class= "bld">Simple.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">guileless.</span> Those who have no evil intentions themselves, and do not readily suspect others of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-18.htm">Philippians 3:18, 19</a>). Had St. Paul thought these people sincere though mistaken, he would doubtless have treated them with the tenderness he shows towards the weak brethren. But he regards them as self-interested, and of the flesh; and against such disturbers of the Church's peace he is, here as elsewhere, indignant (el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11, 12</a>). In speaking of them as serving, or being slaves to, their own belly, it cannot be concluded certainly that he attributed to them habits of sensuality. He may only mean that it is the gratification of the lower part of their nature that they have in view; and there may be allusion to the motive of such persons being the desire of eating and drinking at the cost of the Churches. In 'The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles' (alluded to under Romans 12:6, <span class="accented">seq</span>.) the desire to live without working at the cost of the Church is set down as one of the marks of a false apostle or a false prophet. <span class="cmt_word">And by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple</span> (rather, <span class="accented">innocent</span>, or <span class="accented">harmless.</span> So the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>.

This is apparently adduced as a reason for his exhorting them to beware of those seducers, with a confidence that they will not be seduced by them, ver. 19 being thus dependent on ver. 17. <span class="cmt_word">I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, but simple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">concerning evil.

Amen.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:17-20 How earnest, how endearing are these exhortations! Whatever differs from the sound doctrine of the Scriptures, opens a door to divisions and offences. If truth be forsaken, unity and peace will not last long. Many call Christ, Master and Lord, who are far from serving him. But they serve their carnal, sensual, worldly interests. They corrupt the head by deceiving the heart; perverting the judgments by winding themselves into the affections. We have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. It has been the common policy of seducers to set upon those who are softened by convictions. A pliable temper is good when under good guidance, otherwise it may be easily led astray. Be so wise as not to be deceived, yet so simple as not to be deceivers. The blessing the apostle expects from God, is victory over Satan. This includes all designs and devices of Satan against souls, to defile, disturb, and destroy them; all his attempts to keep us from the peace of heaven here, and the possession of heaven hereafter. When Satan seems to prevail, and we are ready to give up all as lost, then will the God of peace interpose in our behalf. Hold out therefore, faith and patience, yet a little while. If the grace of Christ be with us, who can prevail against us?</body></html>
