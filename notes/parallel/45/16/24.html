This will readily be seen when the parallel expressions are placed side by side.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25-27</a>.--"To Him that is of power."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-20.htm" title="Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,">Ephesians 3:20</a>.--"Unto Him that is able" (precisely the same words in the Greek).<p>"According to my gospel."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:">2Timothy 2:8</a>.--"According to my gospel" (the same phrase is, however, found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>).<p>"The preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5-6</a>.--"By revelation He made known unto us the mystery. . . . which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles should be," &c.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9-10</a>.--"The mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid. . . . to the intent that now. . . . might be known."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/1-2.htm" title="In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;">Titus 1:2-3</a>.--"Which God. . . . before the world began" (peculiar and identical phrase); "but hath in due times manifested His word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment" (same word) "of God our Saviour."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2Timothy 1:9-10</a>.--"Which was given us. . . . before the world began, but is now made manifest," &c.<p>"To God only wise, be glory, through Jesus Christ for ever" (Greek, "for ever and ever"). "Amen."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1Timothy 1:17</a>.--"Now unto the King eternal" (similar to "everlasting God" above), "the only wise God" (but "wise" is a doubtful reading), "be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."<p>(25) <span class= "bld">Stablish</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to confirm and strengthen in all the elements of a Christian character.<p><span class= "bld">According to my gospel.</span>--By those means of grace which the gospel that I preach indicates and enjoins you to use.<p><span class= "bld">My gospel.</span>--The gospel preached by me; the gospel preached as I preach it.<p><span class= "bld">And the preaching of Jesus Christ.</span>--And in accordance with that preaching, the subject matter of which is Christ. The establishment of the Roman Christians was to take place through those appointed ways and means that are laid down in the gospel, and form the main topic of Christian preaching. All means of grace centre in Christ, and it is only in accordance with the due proclamation of Him that the Christian can hope to become confirmed and strengthened.<p><span class= "bld">According to the revelation.</span>--An involved and difficult sentence. The two clauses which began with "according to" are co-ordinate together, and are both dependent upon the word "stablish" above. "May God establish and confirm you in all those ways that the gospel of Christ lays down; that gospel the introduction of which it has been reserved for these latter days to see; a secret long hidden, but now revealed, and corroborated as it is by the prophetic writings, and preached by the Apostles at God's express command; the great instrument of bringing over the Gentiles to the faith."<p><span class= "bld">Of the mystery.</span>--The word "mystery" is used elsewhere in the New Testament precisely in the sense which is so clearly defined in this passage of something which up to the time of the Apostles had remained secret, but had then been made known by divine intervention. The "mystery" thus revealed is the same as that described in the two preceding clauses--in one word, Christianity. All through the Old Testament dispensation, the Christian scheme, which was then future, had remained hidden; now, with Christ's coming, the veil has been taken away.<p><span class= "bld">Since the world began.</span>--The English phrase here is paraphrastic. Literally, the Greek is <span class= "ital">in eternal times</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from this present moment, stretching backwards throughout eternity--an emphatic way of saying, "never before." "The Old Testament is the hand of a clock, proceeding silently round the dial--the New Testament is the striking of the hour" (Bengel).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:21-24 The apostle adds affectionate remembrances from persons with him, known to the Roman Christians. It is a great comfort to see the holiness and usefulness of our kindred. Not many mighty, not many noble are called, but some are. It is lawful for believers to bear civil offices; and it were to be wished that all offices in Christian states, and in the church, were bestowed upon prudent and steady Christians.</body></html>
