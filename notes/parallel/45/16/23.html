The Gaius of the Epistle would probably be identical with the first of these. The name was a common one.<p><span class= "bld">Mine host, and of the whole church.</span>--St. Paul was now lodging in the house of Gaius, as on his previous visit, first in that of Aquila and then in that of Justus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-7.htm" title="And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.">Acts 18:7</a>). It would seem that Gaius lent his house for the meetings of the Church, or it is possible that St. Paul may be alluding, with graceful hyperbole, to the hospitality which he was always ready to exercise.<p><span class= "bld">Erastus.</span>--It is not quite easy to identify this Erastus with the one mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm" title="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.">Acts 19:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm" title="Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.">2Timothy 4:20</a>, who there appears as a travelling companion of the Apostle. The office of "treasurer" to an important city like Corinth would naturally, we should suppose, involve a fixed residence.<p><span class= "bld">Chamberlain.</span>--A better word would seem to be <span class= "ital">treasurer.</span> The officer hi question had charge of the revenues of the city. The title appears upon inscriptions.<p><span class= "bld">A brother.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the brother.</span> No special predicate seems to be needed, and therefore St. Paul (or Tertius) simply describes him as the Christian of that name.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gaius mine host, and of the whole Church, saluteth you</span>. Probably the person mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14</a> as baptized by St. Paul himself at Corinth. There is no reason for identifying him with those of the same name mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1.htm">3 John 1</a>. Gaius was a common name. He appears to have been one who exercised extensive hospitality to Christians, which the apostle was enjoying at the time of writing. <span class="cmt_word">Erastus the chamberlain</span> (rather, <span class="accented">treasurer</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the city</span> (not to be identified with the Erastus of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and Quartus the brother. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ he with you all. Amen</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:21-24 The apostle adds affectionate remembrances from persons with him, known to the Roman Christians. It is a great comfort to see the holiness and usefulness of our kindred. Not many mighty, not many noble are called, but some are. It is lawful for believers to bear civil offices; and it were to be wished that all offices in Christian states, and in the church, were bestowed upon prudent and steady Christians.</body></html>
