Salute Andrenicus and Junia (or <span class="accented">Junias:</span> it is uncertain whether this is masculine or feminine; if the latter, Junia might be the wife of Andronicus<span class="cmt_word">), my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles who also were in Christ before me.</span> It is a question whether by "my kinsmen" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) here and afterwards St. Paul means that the persons so called were his relations, or only that they were Jews (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, where he speaks of the Jews generally as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. There are in all five persons so designated in this chapter. The designation "fellow-prisoners" implies that these two had been, like himself, at some time imprisoned for the faith, but it does not fellow that he and they had been in prison together. If, in speaking of them as "of note among the apostles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)," he means to designate them as themselves apostles, this is an instance of a wider use of the term "apostle" than is generally understood (see note under Romans 12:6, etc.). The phrase, however, will bear the interpretation that they were persons held in honour in the circle of the original twelve. The term, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, is certainly often used distinctively of them, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, by St. Paul himself, the reference in both texts being to his own relations to them; and so here, speaking of two persons, who he also says had been in Christ before himself, he may only mean to point to their having been, as they still were, distinguished in association with the original apostles even before his own conversion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-16 Paul recommends Phebe to the Christians at Rome. It becomes Christians to help one another in their affairs, especially strangers; we know not what help we may need ourselves. Paul asks help for one that had been helpful to many; he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Though the care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remember many persons, and send salutations to each, with particular characters of them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselves hurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to the rest, as brethren and saints, though not named. He adds, in the close, a general salutation to them all, in the name of the churches of Christ.</body></html>
