All the Churches of Christ salute you.</span> For allusions to the <span class="accented">kiss of peace</span> among Christians, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-20.htm">1 Corinthians 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-14.htm">1 Peter 5:14</a>. Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 85) speaks of it as exchanged before the Eucharist, and it is alluded to by many Fathers, directed in the 'Apostolical Constitutions,' and has its place in ancient liturgies (see Bingham, 15. 3:3). St. Paul, of course, in enjoining it here and in other Epistles, has in view the concord which it expressed. In sending salutations from "all the Churches of Christ" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, omitted in the Textus Receptus, having authority decidedly in its favour), he may be understood as conveying to the Roman Christians the feeling towards them that had been expressed generally by the Churches he had visited. He may have spoken wherever he went of his intention of visiting Rome, and perhaps of meanwhile sending a letter thither; and the several Churches may have charged him with kind messages. Before authenticating these salutations with his usual autographic benediction, he feels bound to add one additional warning. The thought occurs to him, and he cannot but give expression to it. The warning is against a class of persons whose mischievous activity he had had experience of elsewhere, and attempts by some of whom to disturb the peace of the Roman Church he may possibly have heard cf. They may have been Judaists, or others who taught views contrary to the received faith, and so caused divisions and offences in the Churches. For allusions to such elsewhere, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; Galatians 3:1, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>. For proof of such having been at work afterwards at Rome, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; Philippians 3:2, 17, <span class="accented">seq.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-16 Paul recommends Phebe to the Christians at Rome. It becomes Christians to help one another in their affairs, especially strangers; we know not what help we may need ourselves. Paul asks help for one that had been helpful to many; he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Though the care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remember many persons, and send salutations to each, with particular characters of them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselves hurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to the rest, as brethren and saints, though not named. He adds, in the close, a general salutation to them all, in the name of the churches of Christ.</body></html>
