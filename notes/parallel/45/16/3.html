It is rather remarkable that the wife should be mentioned first. Perhaps it may be inferred that she was the more active and conspicuous of the two.<p>Aquila was a Jew of Pontus, whom St. Paul had found with his wife at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm" title="After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;">Acts 18:1</a>). They had there been converted by him, and afterwards appear in his company at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1Corinthians 16:19</a>). At the time when this Epistle was written they were at Rome, but later they seem to have returned to Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-19.htm" title="Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.">2Timothy 4:19</a>).<p>The Jew Aquila, who rather more than a century later made a translation of the Old Testament, critically compared with the LXX. in the <span class= "ital">Hexapla</span> of Origen, also came from Pontus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Greet Priscilla</span> (al. <span class="accented">Prisca</span>, which is but another form of the same name) <span class="cmt_word">and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus: who have for my life laid down their own neck: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the Churches of the Gentiles. And greet the Church that is in their house.</span> For other notices of them, el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2, 18, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>; whence we learn that Aquila was a Jew of Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had been settled at Rome, whence, when the Jews were expelled by Claudius, they had gone to Corinth, where St. Paul found them on his first visit to that city; that St. Paul abode with them there, working with Aquila at tent-making, which was the croft of both; that they left Corinth with St. Paul for Syria, and were for a time left by him at Ephesus, where they instructed Apollos on his arrival there; that, when St. Paul wrote from Ephesus his First Epistle to the Corinthians, they sent greetings by it, having then a congregation of Christians which assembled at their house; that, having returned to Rome when the Epistle to the Romans was written, their house there also was made available for the same purpose; and that, when St. Paul was for the last time a prisoner at Rome before his martyrdom, they were once more living at Ephesus. They were probably in good circumstances, having had both at Rome and Ephesus houses large enough to be used as churches; and they were evidently leading and active members of the Christian community. It would seem that Priscilla, the wife, was especially so, and she may have been, like Phoebe, officially employed; for though, when they are first mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2</a>) as having lately come to Corinth, and when they themselves send greetings to Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>), Aquila's name naturally comes first, yet St. Paul in all other mention of them reverses the order. The occasion of their having apparently risked their own lives in defence of St. Paul is unknown. It may have been at Corinth at the time of the Jewish insurrection against him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>), or at Ephesus at the time of the tumult raised by Demetrius the silversmith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23</a>, etc.), when St. Paul had been in imminent danger. The phrase, "laid down their neck" (not, as in the Authorized Version, "necks"), seems only to denote, figuratively, . "exposed their lives to danger." It appears, from the large number of greetings which follow, that there were now many Christians at Rome known to, or any rate known of by, the apostle. It does not follow that he was acquainted with all of them personally. He may have heard of them in the frequent inquiries he had doubtless made about the Roman Church (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). Many of them, however, he evidently knew, and with some had been associated. It was likely that many known to him in various quarters might have had occasion to resort to Rome. There are in all twenty-six individuals to whom greetings are sent, together with two households of slaves, and probably three congregations, as will appear below. <span class="cmt_word">Salute</span> (or, as before, <span class="accented">greet</span>. The verb is the same as before, and so throughout the chapter) <span class="cmt_word">my beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Asia</span> (certainly so, rather than <span class="accented">Achaia</span>, probably introduced into the text from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>) <span class="cmt_word">unto Christ</span>. <span class="accented">Asia</span> means the proconsular province so called, being the western part of Asia Minor, of which the capital was Ephesus. Epaenetus may have been St. Paul's own first convert there during his second missionary journey (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>). The fact of the apostle having been then "forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the Word in Asia" does not preclude there having been converts thence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-16 Paul recommends Phebe to the Christians at Rome. It becomes Christians to help one another in their affairs, especially strangers; we know not what help we may need ourselves. Paul asks help for one that had been helpful to many; he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Though the care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remember many persons, and send salutations to each, with particular characters of them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselves hurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to the rest, as brethren and saints, though not named. He adds, in the close, a general salutation to them all, in the name of the churches of Christ.</body></html>
