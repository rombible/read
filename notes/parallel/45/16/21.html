He would seem to have gone on into Greece and to Corinth itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>). He had thence rejoined St. Paul on his way through Macedonia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>), and he was now with him again in Greece.<p>In the other Epistles (2 Cor., Phil., Colossians , 1 and 2 Thess., and Philem.), when Timothy was present with St. Paul at the time of his writing, he is joined with him in the salutation at the outset. Why his name does not appear in the heading of the present letter we can hardly say. Perhaps he happened to be away at the time when it was begun; or, St. Paul may have thought it well that a church which was entirely strange to him, and to which Timothy too was a stranger, should be addressed in his own name alone.<p><span class= "bld">Lucius.</span>--This may, perhaps, be the Lucius of Cyrene mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>; but the name is too common for anything to be asserted positively.<p><span class= "bld">Jason.</span>--A Jason is mentioned as having received St. Paul and his companions on their first visit to Thessalonica, and getting himself into trouble in consequence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5-9</a>). It would be some slight argument for this identification if the word "kinsmen" were taken in its narrower sense; there would then be a reason why St. Paul should have found hospitality in the house of Jason.<p><span class= "bld">Sosipater.</span>--Possibly "Sopater, the son of Pyrrhus, of Ber?a," mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a> (corrected reading).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-24.</span> - L. <span class="accented">Greetings from Corinth.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Timotheus my workfellow</span> (Timothy may have joined St. Paul at Corinth before the letter was finally sent, not having been with him when it was begun.

Here the amanuensis interposes his own greeting in his own person. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:21-24 The apostle adds affectionate remembrances from persons with him, known to the Roman Christians. It is a great comfort to see the holiness and usefulness of our kindred. Not many mighty, not many noble are called, but some are. It is lawful for believers to bear civil offices; and it were to be wished that all offices in Christian states, and in the church, were bestowed upon prudent and steady Christians.</body></html>
