It probably means members of the same nation--Jew like myself.<p><span class= "bld">Fellow-prisoners.</span>--It is not at all known to what this refers. The only imprisonment of St. Paul recorded in the Acts after this date would be that at Philippi, but allusions such as those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;">2Corinthians 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.">2Corinthians 11:23</a>, at once show the defectiveness of the narrative, and point to occasions when the persons mentioned might easily have shared imprisonment with him.<p><span class= "bld">Of note among the apostles.</span>--An ambiguous expression, which <span class= "ital">might</span> mean, and, judging by the word alone, would perhaps more naturally be taken to mean, "distinguished <span class= "ital">as</span> Apostles themselves." This sense is not to be disregarded as absolutely impossible, for the title "Apostles" does not appear to have been limited to the Twelve. It is decidedly more probable that James, the Lord's brother, who is called an Apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a>, and elsewhere, was not identical with James the son of Alphaeus. And, however this may be, there can be no question about Barnabas, who is called an Apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-14.htm" title="Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,">Acts 14:14</a>. St. Paul himself seems to draw a distinction between "the Twelve" and "all the Apostles," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-7.htm" title="After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.">1Corinthians 15:7</a>. Still, on the whole, it seems best to suppose that the phrase "of note among the Apostles" means, "highly esteemed by the apostolic circle."<p><span class= "bld">Were in Christ. . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> became Christians.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-16 Paul recommends Phebe to the Christians at Rome. It becomes Christians to help one another in their affairs, especially strangers; we know not what help we may need ourselves. Paul asks help for one that had been helpful to many; he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Though the care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remember many persons, and send salutations to each, with particular characters of them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselves hurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to the rest, as brethren and saints, though not named. He adds, in the close, a general salutation to them all, in the name of the churches of Christ.</body></html>
