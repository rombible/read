The greetings at the end are naturally introduced by a few words of explanation as to the way in which the more general exhortations that preceded are to be received by the Roman Christians, and a somewhat longer statement on the part of the Apostle of his own relations to the Church at Rome. This might seem to be the more necessary as the Church was not one of his own founding, and he might seem to be both going out of his way and acting in contradiction to his own principles in writing to them at all.<p>I write thus to you though you do not really need all these exhortations. Not only do others tell me, but I am convinced myself that you possess all the qualifications which would fit you to teach others instead of receiving instruction yourselves.<p><span class= "bld">Ye also.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">even yourselves,</span> as you are, and without any stimulus or incitement given to you from without.<p><span class= "bld">Goodness</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> goodness of disposition, readiness to practise all the Christian virtues, especially those to which the last section had been exhorting.<p><span class= "bld">Knowledge</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of the doctrinal aspects of Christianity as they had been set forth in the earlier portion of the Epistle. No doubt the Apostle had really much to teach his readers--he does not say that he had not--but he courteously gives them credit for all they knew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-33.</span> - I. <span class="accented">Expression of confidence in the general disposition of the Roman Christians, and of the writer's desire to visit them, and his intentions in accordance with that desire.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another</span>. It is St. Paul's courteous as well as kindly way to compliment those to whom he writes on what he believes to be good in them, and to cling to a good opinion of them, even where he has some misgivings, or has had reason to find fault (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-7.htm">2 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 7:3, <span class="accented">seq</span>.). Here "I myself also" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>) may have tacit reference to the general good report of the Roman Church (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a> and Romans 16:19), which he means to say he himself by no means doubts the truth of, notwithstanding his previous warnings. "Ye yourselves also" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) implies his trust that even without such warnings they would of themselves be as he would wish them to be; "full of goodness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), so as to be kind to one another, as they were enlightened and replete with knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.</body></html>
