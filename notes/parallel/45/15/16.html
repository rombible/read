Both refer originally to the liturgical service of the Temple; the first to the whole of the functions both of the priests and Levites, the second to the special function of the priests in the offering of sacrifice. St. Paul is a "minister of Jesus Christ;" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> his sacred office was given to him by Christ; it was Christ who appointed and ordained him to it; and his special duty as a priest of the gospel was to see that the Church of the Gentiles, whom it fell to him to present as a sacrifice to God, should be fit for such a sacrifice, made holy by the indwelling Spirit, and therefore acceptable to Him to whom it was offered.<p><span class= "bld">To the Gentiles.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">in reference to the Gentiles.</span> The branch, or department of the Christian ministry specially allotted to St. Paul was the evangelisation of the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">Ministering the gospel of God.</span>--Serving the gospel of God as a priest stands at the altar in the service of the tabernacle.

Here they are evidently used in their sacrificial meaning, but applied metaphorically; the "acceptable offering" which Paul offers to God is that of the Gentiles whom he brings to the faith. "The preaching of the gospel he calls a sacrificial service (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>), and genuine faith an acceptable offering" (Theodoret). "This is my priesthood, to preach and to proclaim" (Chrysostom); cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.</body></html>
