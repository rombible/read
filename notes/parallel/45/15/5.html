The Apostle prays that along with the spirit of steadfast endurance God will also give them that spirit of unanimity which proceeds from singleness of aim. There seems, at first sight, to be little or no connection between the God of "patience and consolation" and the being "likeminded." They are connected, however, through the idea of singleness of purpose. He who is wholly self-dedicated to Christ, and who in the strength of that self-dedication is able to endure persecution, will also have a close bond of union with all who set before themselves the same object.<p><span class= "bld">Consolation. . . .</span>--The same word as "comfort" in the previous verse.<p><span class= "bld">To be likeminded. . . .</span>--To have the same thoughts, feelings, sentiments, hopes, and aims.<p><span class= "bld">According to Christ Jesus.</span>--The conforming to that "spirit of Christ" which it is to be assumed that all who call themselves Christians have put on.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the God of patience and comfort</span> (the same word as before, though here in the Authorized Version rendered <span class="accented">consolation</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>grant</span> <span class="cmt_word">you to be like-minded</span> (see on Romans 12:16<span class="cmt_word">), one with another according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one accord with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> (so certainly, rather than, as in the Authorized Version, "God, even the Father of," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore receive ye one another</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-1.htm">Romans 14:1</a>, and note<span class="cmt_word">), even as Christ also received us</span> (or <span class="accented">you</span>, which is better supported, and, for a reason to be given below, more likely) <span class="cmt_word">to the glory of God.</span> As in ver. 3, the example of Christ is again adduced. The connection of thought becomes plain if we take the admonition, "Receive ye one another," to be mainly addressed to "the strong," and these to consist principally of Gentile believers, the "weak brethren" being (as above supposed) prejudiced Jewish Christians. To the former the apostle says, "Receive to yourselves with full sympathy those Jewish weak ones, even as Christ, though sent primarily to fulfil the ancient promises to the house of Israel only (see ver. 8), embraced you Gentiles (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>) also within the arms of mercy" Thus the sequence of thought in ver. 8, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, appears. "Unto the glory of God" means "so as to redound to his glory." Christ's receiving the Gentiles was unto his glory; and it is implied that the mutual receiving of each other by believers would be so too. The idea of God's glory being the end of all runs through the whole passage (cf. vers. 6, 9, 11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-7 Christian liberty was allowed, not for our pleasure, but for the glory of God, and the good of others. We must please our neighbour, for the good of his soul; not by serving his wicked will, and humouring him in a sinful way; if we thus seek to please men, we are not the servants of Christ. Christ's whole life was a self-denying, self-displeasing life. And he is the most advanced Christian, who is the most conformed to Christ. Considering his spotless purity and holiness, nothing could be more contrary to him, than to be made sin and a curse for us, and to have the reproaches of God fall upon him; the just for the unjust. He bore the guilt of sin, and the curse for it; we are only called to bear a little of the trouble of it. He bore the presumptuous sins of the wicked; we are called only to bear the failings of the weak. And should not we be humble, self-denying, and ready to consider one another, who are members one of another? The Scriptures are written for our use and benefit, as much as for those to whom they were first given. Those are most learned who are most mighty in the Scriptures. That comfort which springs from the word of God, is the surest and sweetest, and the greatest stay to hope. The Spirit as a Comforter, is the earnest of our inheritance. This like-mindedness must be according to the precept of Christ, according to his pattern and example. It is the gift of God; and a precious gift it is, for which we must earnestly seek unto him. Our Divine Master invites his disciples, and encourages them by showing himself as meek and lowly in spirit. The same disposition ought to mark the conduct of his servants, especially of the strong towards the weak. The great end in all our actions must be, that God may be glorified; nothing more forwards this, than the mutual love and kindness of those who profess religion. Those that agree in Christ may well agree among themselves.</body></html>
