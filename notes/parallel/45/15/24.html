Whether he ever succeeded in carrying out his purpose we cannot say positively, but it is, perhaps, rather more probable than not. A tradition which dates back to the Epistle of Clement of Rome (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> A.D. 95) says that he visited "the extreme limit of the West," a phrase which seems hardly satisfied by being interpreted simply of Rome. The author of the Muratorian Fragment (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> A.D. 170) speaks expressly of a journey to Spain, though his language looks as if it might be an inference from this Epistle. The Acts, it is true, do not carry the Apostle beyond Rome, but the phenomena of the Pastoral Epistles and tradition together seem to justify us in assuming the probability of a later journey or journeys not recorded in that volume, and the argument from silence, as the book in any case stops short of the death of the Apostle, counts for but little. This is just a case in which it cannot be wrong to accept the balance of the argument as it stands. At the same time it is impossible not to feel the grievous blank which lies over the later years of the life of St. Paul, and few things would be more deeply interesting, or would throw more light on the principles of criticism, than the discovery, if only it were possible, of the merest fragment bearing upon it. It is to be feared, however, that there is no reasonable hope of such a discovery being ever made.<p><span class= "bld">I will come to you . . .</span>--These words are wanting in the true text, and have to be supplied. The sentence is left unfinished.<p><span class= "bld">To be brought on my way.</span>--A graphic description of this "bringing upon the way," is given in the account of the departure of St. Paul after his seven days' sojourn at Tyre, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-5.htm" title="And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.">Acts 21:5</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-36.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.">Acts 20:36-38</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Somewhat filled.</span>--Another characteristic touch. The Apostle will not allow it to be supposed that he could have <span class= "ital">enough</span> of the society of the Roman Church. He therefore qualifies his expression, "somewhat filled," or "satisfied," "satisfied if only in part."<p><span class= "bld">If first I be somewhat filled</span> is practically equivalent to "when I have been filled."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:22-29 The apostle sought the things of Christ more than his own will, and would not leave his work of planting churches to go to Rome. It concerns all to do that first which is most needful. We must not take it ill if our friends prefer work which is pleasing to God, before visits and compliments, which may please us. It is justly expected from all Christians, that they should promote every good work, especially that blessed work, the conversion of souls. Christian society is a heaven upon earth, an earnest of our gathering together unto Christ at the great day. Yet it is but partial, compared with our communion with Christ; for that only will satisfy the soul. The apostle was going to Jerusalem, as the messenger of charity. God loves a cheerful giver. Every thing that passes between Christians should be a proof and instance of the union they have in Jesus Christ. The Gentiles received the gospel of salvation from the Jews; therefore were bound to minister to them in what was needed for the body. Concerning what he expected from them he speaks doubtfully; but concerning what he expected from God he speaks confidently. We cannot expect too little from man, nor too much from God. And how delightful and advantageous it is to have the gospel with the fulness of its blessings! What wonderful and happy effects does it produce, when attended with the power of the Spirit!</body></html>
