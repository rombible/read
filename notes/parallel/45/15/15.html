In some passages the Apostle feels that he had gone beyond the modest limits which he might have seemed to mark out for himself by what he had just been saying. He had taken a liberty, but not too great a liberty. He had spoken to them rather pointedly at times, but he had been careful not to go too far. The reference may be supposed to be to exhortations such as those in Romans 13, 14, and in other parts of the Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">As putting you in mind.</span>--Another delicate expression. The Apostle has not been telling them of something that they did not know before, but merely reminding them of what they knew. And he claims the right to do this because of the special grace given to him as an Apostle. The Judaising section in the Church at Rome did not go so far as that in Galatia. It recognised the apostleship of St. Paul, and he knew that he could safely appeal to this recognition.<p><span class= "bld">Because of the grace.</span>--Comp. "grace and apostleship" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>. "Grace" is here that special endowment with divine gifts by which the Apostles were distinguished from other Christians.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- But I have written unto you the more boldly, brethren, in some measure</span> (so, as in the Revised Version, or, in part (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c2;</span>), rather than <span class="accented">in</span> some sort, as in the Authorized Version. The allusion seems to be to the passages in the Epistle in which he has been bold to admonish urgently; such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; Romans 12:3; and especially ch. Romans 14.), <span class="cmt_word">as putting yon in mind</span> (reminding you only of what you doubtless know), <span class="cmt_word">because of the grace given me of God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as appears from what follows, of apostleship to the Gentiles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5, 14</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>). Though the Church of Rome was not one of his own foundation, and he had no desire, there or elsewhere, to build on another man's foundation (ver. 20), yet his peculiar mission as apostle to the Gentiles gave him a claim to admonish them. The reason thus given is, it will be observed, a confirmation of the view, otherwise apparent, that the Roman Church consisted principally of Gentile believers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.</body></html>
