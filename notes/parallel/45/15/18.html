He had, in fact, preached first at Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20</a>), and afterwards at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-29.htm">Acts 9:29</a>); but he mentions Jerusalem first, as being the original home of the gospel in the East, and, indeed, the first scene of his own preaching in fellowship with the original apostles. Thence he had extended it in various quarters (for the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> - trans. "round about" - cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12</a>), and carried it into Europe, Illyricum being the western limit so far reached. It is true that there is no mention in the Acts of his having actually visited Illyria. In the journey of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>. he plainly got no further west than Betted, which is, however, not far off; and he might possibly mean here only to say that he had extended the gospel to the borders of Illyricum, but for the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and his seeming to imply afterwards (ver. 23) that he had gone as far as he could in those regions, and consequently contemplated a journey to Spain. Hence, the narrative of Acts not being an exhaustive history, it may be supposed that he had on some occasion extended his operations from Macedonia to Illyricum, as he may well have done on his visit to the latter mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-1.htm">Acts 20:1-3</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> allows for a visit into Illyricum. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.</body></html>
