The original has reference to the servant of Jehovah, first suffering and then glorified, so that <span class= "ital">kings</span> should be dumb with astonishment at the change. Here it is applied to the evangelisation of distant heathen nations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-15.htm">Isaiah 52:15</a>, as in the LXX. The passage is Messianic; but St. Paul need be understood to be quoting it as predictive or directive of the rule he follows. Enough if it expresses his meaning well). <span class="cmt_word">For which cause also I have been much hindered</span> (or, <span class="accented">was for the most part</span>, or <span class="accented">many times hindered</span>) from coming to you. The hindrance had been, mainly at least, as is evident from <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f7c;</span> (ver. 22), the obligation he was under of completing his ministry in the first place in other quarters (see on Romans 1:13). <span class="cmt_word">But now having no longer place in these regions</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the context, there being no additional sphere for my activity there. He had now planted the gospel in all the principal centres, leaving disciples and converts, and probably an ordained ministry, to carry on the work and extend it in the regions round. In this his proper apostolic work consisted; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14-17</a><span class="cmt_word">), and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I hope to see you on my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company</span>. The sense of this verse is no way affected by the omission of "I will come unto you," which authorities are against retaining. If "for," after this omission, be retained, the sentence is incomplete, as St. Paul's sometimes are. The omission of "for" (for which there is some little authority) leaves the sentence improved. The apostle's selection of Spain as his next intended sphere of labour might be due to the notoriety of that Roman province, and the facility of communication with it by sea. His omission of Italy, except for a passing visit, is accounted for by his principle, already enunciated, of not building on other men's foundation, there being already a flourishing Church at any rate at Rome. He hoped, as appears from this verse, that some of the members of it might join him in his mission to Spain. For the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> would imply their going all the way in the case of a sea-voyage. For the use of the word, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-38.htm">Acts 20:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-16.htm">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>. Observe the characteristic courtesy of the concluding clause, which is literally, "should I be first <span class="accented">in part"</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> not as much as I should wish, but to such extent as my short stay with you will allow) "filled with you," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enjoy you. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.</body></html>
