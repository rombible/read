Christ's primary <span class="accented">ministry</span> was to "the house of Israel" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>), in vindication of God's <span class="accented">truth</span>, or faithfulness to his promises made through the patriarchs to the chosen race: his taking in of the Gentiles was an extension of the Divine <span class="accented">mercy</span>, to his greater glory. The infinitive <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in ver. 9, seems best taken in the same construction with <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 8, both being dependent on <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span>. As it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy Name. This quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-50.htm">2 Samuel 22:50</a>, with those that follow, are for scriptural confirmation of God's purpose, which has just been spoken of, to include the Gentiles in his covenanted mercies to Israel, so that they too might glorify him. St. Paul, after a manner usual with him; follows cut a thought suggested in the course of his argument, so as to interrupt the latter for a while, but to return to it in ver. 13. All, in fact, from the beginning of ver. 8 to the end of ver. 12, is parenthetical, suggested by "even as Christ received you,." at the end of ver. 7. All this, it may be observed, is confirmatory of Pauline authorship. The first quotation introduces David, the theocratic king, confessing and praising God, not apart from the Gentiles, but among them. The second, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, calls on the Gentiles themselves to join in Israel's rejoicing; the third, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, does the same; the last, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, foretells definitely the reign of the Messiah over Gentiles as well as Jews, and the hope also of the Gentiles in him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:8-13 Christ fulfilled the prophecies and promises relating to the Jews, and the Gentile converts could have no excuse for despising them. The Gentiles, being brought into the church, are companions in patience and tribulation. They should praise God. Calling upon all the nations to praise the Lord, shows that they shall have knowledge of him. We shall never seek to Christ till we trust in him. And the whole plan of redemption is suited to reconcile us to one another, as well as to our gracious God, so that an abiding hope of eternal life, through the sanctifying and comforting power of the Holy Spirit, may be attained. Our own power will never reach this; therefore where this hope is, and is abounding, the blessed Spirit must have all the glory. All joy and peace; all sorts of true joy and peace, so as to suppress doubts and fears, through the powerful working of the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
