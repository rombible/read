SUPPLEMENTARY. (See summary of contents, p. 16.) Questions have been raised and much discussed as to the connection of the last two chapters, 15. and 16, with the rest of the Epistle. The facts and the opinions founded on them may be summarized as follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> There is sufficient proof that in early times copies of the Epistle existed without these two chapters. The evidence is this - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Origen (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>) speaks of some copies in his time being without the concluding doxology, and also without any part of these two chapters, attributing the omission to Marcion, for his own purposes, having mutilated the Epistle. His words are, "Caput hoc (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>) Marcion, a quo scripturae evangelicae et apostolicae interpolatae sunt, de hac Epistola penitus abstulit; et non solum hoe, sod ab hoc loco ubi scriptum est, Omne autem quod non ex fide est peccatum est (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>) usque ad finem cuncta dissecuit." Tertullian also ('Contra Marcion') speaks of Marcion having mutilated this Epistle, though not specifying these two chapters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> In Codex Amiatinus (a manuscript of the Latin Bible of the sixth century) there is a prefixed table of contents, referring by numbers to the sections into which the Epistle was divided, and describing the subject of each section. In this table the fiftieth section is thus described: "On the peril of one who grieves his brother by his meat," plainly denoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15-23</a>; and the next and concluding section is described thus: "On the mystery of the Lord kept secret before his Passion, but after his Passion revealed," which description can only refer to the doxology of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>. Hence it would seem that in some Latin copy of the Epistle to which the table of contents referred, the doxology followed <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a> with nothing between. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Cyprian. who quote largely from the Epistle, have no references to ch. 15. and 16. It may be observed, however, that mere omission to quote is not in itself conclusive, though it may be corroborative of other evidence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The concluding doxology (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>), though placed, as in the Textus Receptus, at the end of ch. 16. in the uncials generally and by the Latin Fathers, is found at the end of ch. 14. in the uncial L, in most cursives, in the Greek Lectionaries, and is so referred to by the Greek commentators. Some few manuscripts have it in both places, and some few omit it altogether. Origen also (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) says that in some copies of the Epistle which contained ch. 15. and 16, the doxology was placed at the end of ch. 16, and in others at the end of ch. 14. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In one manuscript (G) all mention of Rome in the Epistle is omitted; and in one cursive (47) there is a marginal note to the effect that "some one" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably, some commentator) makes no mention of the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span> either in the interpretation or the text. In view of these facts, it may be held that the Epistle, as first written, ended at ch. 14. with the doxology appended, ch. 15. and 16. (ending at ver. 24 with the usual concluding benediction, "The grace," etc.) having been an addition. Baur, after his manner - and this partly on supposed internal evidence - disputes the two last chapters having been written by St. Paul at all, regarding them as an addition by a later hand. But his reasons are too arbitrary to stand against the authority of existing manuscripts, to say nothing of the internal evidence itself, which really appears to us to tell the other way. Such internal evidence will appear in the course of the Exposition. One view, put forth by Ruckert, and recently supported by Bishop Lightfoot (<span class="accented">Journal of Philology</span>, 1871, No. 6), is that St. Paul, having originally written the whole Epistle, including the two chapters, but without the doxology, reissued it at a later period of his life in a shortened form for general circulation, having then appended the doxology. This theory, however, is but a conjecture, put forward as best accounting for all the facts of the case, including that of all mention of Rome having been apparently absent from some copies. This, however, might be accounted for by the Epistle having been issued, after St. Paul's time, in a form suited for general circulation. On the whole, we may take it as probable that the apostle, having first concluded his Epistle with ch. 14. and the doxology, felt himself urged to resume a subject which lay so near his heart, and so appended ch. 15, and then the salutations, etc., in ch. 16, before the letter was sent. This supposition would in itself account for copies of the Epistle having got into circulation without the additions to it. Possibly Marcion took advantage of finding some such copies to deny the genuineness of the two final chapters altogether; and his doing so would be likely to promote circulation of the shorter copies. It will be observed that the Epistle, as a doctrinal treatise practically applied, is complete without the last two chapters; and also that ch. 15, though connected in thought with the end of ch. 14, might be, and indeed reads like, a resumption and further enforce-merit of its ideas. It seems, indeed, as if three appendices, or postscripts, had been added by the apostle; the first ending with the benediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-33.htm">Romans 15:33</a>; the second (commending Phoebe, who was to be the bearer of the letter, and sending salutations to persons at Rome) with the benediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>; and the third (which might be added at the last moment) with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-24.htm">Romans 16:24</a>. All the benedictions are thus accounted for, being the apostle's usual concluding authentications (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>). As to the proper position of the doxology, if the view last given be correct, its original one would be most naturally at the end of ch. 14; since otherwise the Epistle, as first completed, would have nothing answering to the usual benedictions in conclusion. And though this is not a benediction, but a doxology, embodying in solemn terms the main idea of the preceding treatise, such a conclusion is in keeping with the peculiar character of the Epistle to the Romans. Finally, though uncial authority is decidedly in favour of the position of the doxology at the end of ch. 16, this does not seem to be a sufficient reason for con-eluding it to have been originally there. If there existed anciently two editions, one with, and the other without, the two chapters appended, transcribers of the longer edition would be likely to place the doxology at the end of what they believed to be the true conclusion of the original Epistle. After all, the question cannot be considered as settled. It has been deemed sufficient here to state the main arguments for or against the various views that have been taken. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - H. <span class="accented">Renewed admonition to bear with the weak, enforced by Scripture and the example of Christ.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We then</span> (rather, <span class="accented">but we</span>, or <span class="accented">now we.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> here certainly seems to link this chapter to the preceding section; but it is not inconsistent with the chapter being an addition to a completed letter, of which it takes up the concluding thought) <span class="cmt_word">that are strong</span> (St. Paul, here as elsewhere, identifies himself with the more enlightened party) <span class="cmt_word">ought</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> expresses <span class="accented">obligation of duty</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to bear the infirmities of the weak</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and not to please ourselves.

The quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>; one in which a righteous sufferer under persecution calls on God for deliverance, and to some parts of which even the details of Christ's Passion strikingly correspond. The first part of the verse here quoted, "The zeal of thine house," etc., is applied to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-7 Christian liberty was allowed, not for our pleasure, but for the glory of God, and the good of others. We must please our neighbour, for the good of his soul; not by serving his wicked will, and humouring him in a sinful way; if we thus seek to please men, we are not the servants of Christ. Christ's whole life was a self-denying, self-displeasing life. And he is the most advanced Christian, who is the most conformed to Christ. Considering his spotless purity and holiness, nothing could be more contrary to him, than to be made sin and a curse for us, and to have the reproaches of God fall upon him; the just for the unjust. He bore the guilt of sin, and the curse for it; we are only called to bear a little of the trouble of it. He bore the presumptuous sins of the wicked; we are called only to bear the failings of the weak. And should not we be humble, self-denying, and ready to consider one another, who are members one of another? The Scriptures are written for our use and benefit, as much as for those to whom they were first given. Those are most learned who are most mighty in the Scriptures. That comfort which springs from the word of God, is the surest and sweetest, and the greatest stay to hope. The Spirit as a Comforter, is the earnest of our inheritance. This like-mindedness must be according to the precept of Christ, according to his pattern and example. It is the gift of God; and a precious gift it is, for which we must earnestly seek unto him. Our Divine Master invites his disciples, and encourages them by showing himself as meek and lowly in spirit. The same disposition ought to mark the conduct of his servants, especially of the strong towards the weak. The great end in all our actions must be, that God may be glorified; nothing more forwards this, than the mutual love and kindness of those who profess religion. Those that agree in Christ may well agree among themselves.</body></html>
