All this scheme of God's dealings, apparently so severe, is really most merciful. To those who really deserved His wrath, He showed longsuffering. While for us who now believe, Gentiles as well as Jews, He had mercy and glory in store. But in both cases the final result was strictly in accordance with prophecy. Hosea had foretold the admission of the Gentiles. Isaiah the exclusion of the greater part of the Jews.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">What if</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The sentence in the original is incomplete. In its full form it would run, "If God willing to show His wrath" . . . (what can man reply?) This latter clause is dropped or lost in the course of the argument. The best and simplest expedient to supply its place is that adopted in the Authorised version, inserting "what" in italics at the beginning: "What if," &c. There is a second suppression later in the sentence. At the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm" title="And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared to glory,">Romans 9:23</a> we should have to insert some such clause as "He reserved His glory for them," in order to make the sentence strictly grammatical. These irregularities are due to the Apostle's habit of dictating, and to the lively flow of his thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">Willing.</span>--While His will was (ultimately) to execute His wrath and display His sovereign judicial power, nevertheless He bore with evildoers, and gave them time for repentance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What if</span> (literally, <span class="accented">but if</span>, involving an anacoluthon<span class="cmt_word">) God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels</span> (not, as in the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">the vessels</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of wrath fitted to destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy which he afore prepared unto glory; whom he also called, even us, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles</span>. "And" at the beginning of ver. 23 is omitted in the uncial B, and there is considerable authority of versions and Fathers for rejecting it. Without it the sentence runs better, and its drift becomes more apparent. The purpose expressed in ver. 23 thus comes out distinctly as the grand ultimate Divine purpose, to which the display of wrath and power spoken of in the previous verse is but subsidiary; and this drift becomes the more apparent, if we supply in English, as we may do, "while" before "willing" in ver. 22. Thus the drift would be, "What If God, while willing to exhibit his wrath and manifest his power, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath that had become fitted for destruction, in order that he might manifest the riches of his glory," etc. The idea expressed by "endured," etc., seems suggested by Pharaoh's case (see on ver. 17 with regard to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX., which the apostle appears here to retain the idea of, though he varied from it); but it is the Jewish nation of his own day that he has now in view. They were rejected from inheritance of the promises, and under Divine wrath; as he says in another place, "The wrath had come upon them to the uttermost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>). But they were still borne with; they were not finally cut off; and what if their present rejection were but subservient to the great purpose of mercy to the true Israel? The thought, hinted here, is carried out in ch. 11, where even the idea is further entertained of Israel itself as a nation, after judgment endured, coming into God's true fold at last, according to the design of God, through ways inscrutable by us, to "have mercy upon all." The forms of expression used in the passage before us are to be noted in support of the view we have taken of St. Paul's general meaning. "The vessels of wrath" are said to be "fitted to destruction" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); of the "vessels of mercy" it is said that God "afore prepared" them unto glory. Predestination to salvation is certainly a doctrine of St. Paul, but he nowhere intimates predestination to reprobation. Further, "Non dicit quae <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, sod <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>: praescinditur a causa efficiente: tantum dicitur quales inveniat Deus quibus tram infert" (Bengel). Lastly, it may be observed that, though <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> carries with it the idea of individual salvation, yet this only comes in as the outcome and ultimate purpose of the calling of nations or races of men. The drift of the preceding argument remains still what it has been stated to be. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:14-24 Whatever God does, must be just. Wherein the holy, happy people of God differ from others, God's grace alone makes them differ. In this preventing, effectual, distinguishing grace, he acts as a benefactor, whose grace is his own. None have deserved it; so that those who are saved, must thank God only; and those who perish, must blame themselves only, Hos 13:9. God is bound no further than he has been pleased to bind himself by his own covenant and promise, which is his revealed will. And this is, that he will receive, and not cast out, those that come to Christ; but the drawing of souls in order to that coming, is an anticipating, distinguishing favour to whom he will. Why does he yet find fault? This is not an objection to be made by the creature against his Creator, by man against God. The truth, as it is in Jesus, abases man as nothing, as less than nothing, and advances God as sovereign Lord of all. Who art thou that art so foolish, so feeble, so unable to judge the Divine counsels? It becomes us to submit to him, not to reply against him. Would not men allow the infinite God the same sovereign right to manage the affairs of the creation, as the potter exercises in disposing of his clay, when of the same lump he makes one vessel to a more honourable, and one to a meaner use? God could do no wrong, however it might appear to men. God will make it appear that he hates sin. Also, he formed vessels filled with mercy. Sanctification is the preparation of the soul for glory. This is God's work. Sinners fit themselves for hell, but it is God who prepares saints for heaven; and all whom God designs for heaven hereafter, he fits for heaven now. Would we know who these vessels of mercy are? Those whom God has called; and these not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles. Surely there can be no unrighteousness in any of these Divine dispensations. Nor in God's exercising long-suffering, patience, and forbearance towards sinners under increasing guilt, before he brings utter destruction upon them. The fault is in the hardened sinner himself. As to all who love and fear God, however such truths appear beyond their reason to fathom, yet they should keep silence before him. It is the Lord alone who made us to differ; we should adore his pardoning mercy and new-creating grace, and give diligence to make our calling and election sure.</body></html>
