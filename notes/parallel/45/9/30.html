He now takes up a point of view which is the direct opposite of this, and in explaining the <span class= "ital">causes</span> which led to the rejection of Israel, those which he puts forward are all such as depend for their validity on the freedom of the will. It is needless to say that this is abundantly recognised in other parts of St. Paul's writings, especially in the earnest practical exhortations which he addresses to his readers. This, then, must be taken to qualify the argument that has preceded. The freedom of the will and the absolute sovereignty of God are two propositions which, though apparently contradictory, are both really true at one and the same time. When stated singly, each is apt to appear one-sided. They are reconciled, as it were, beneath the surface, in some way inscrutable to us. Both rest on evidence that in itself is incontrovertible.<p>The great reason for the rejection of Israel and for the admission of the Gentiles is that the Gentiles did, and that they did not, base their attempts at righteousness upon faith. Righteousness is the middle term which leads to salvation. The Gentiles, without seeking, found; the Jews, seeking in a wrong way, failed to find it.<p>(30) <span class= "bld">Which followed not after righteousness.</span>--Not having a special revelation, and being inattentive to the law of conscience.<p><span class= "bld">Attained</span> <span class= "bld">to</span> <span class= "bld">righteousness.</span>--By accepting the offer of Christianity, and especially the Christian doctrine of justification by faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm">Romans 10:21</a>. - (3) The cause <span class="accented">is in the fault of the Jews themselves.</span> Hitherto the apostle has viewed his subject from the side of the Divine will and purpose (see note on ver. 19). He now views it from the side of human responsibility. The rejection of the Jews is now attributed, not to God's purpose to reject them, but to their own fault, in that they would not accept God's terms. "Hic expresse ponit causam reprobationis, quia scilicet nolint credere Evangelio. Ideo supra dixi, similitudinem de luto non ira accipiendam esse quasi non sit in ipsa voluntate hominis causa reprobationis" (Melancthon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall we say then! That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. But Israel, following after a law of righteousness, attained not to</span> (or, <span class="accented">arrived not at, so</span> as to distinguish <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, used here, from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>, previously used of the Gentiles. It expresses the idea of failing to reach what is being pursued) <span class="cmt_word">a law of righteousness</span>. The Gentiles are here said to have attained <span class="accented">righteousness</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the righteousness of God, appropriated by faith, as previously explained); but Israel to have pursued, without reaching <span class="accented">it, a law</span> (not, as in the Authorized Version, the <span class="accented">Law</span>) of righteousness; because in the Law of Hoses they sought a <span class="accented">justifying</span> law, which in itself it could not be. The idea is resumed in ch. 10:3. The concluding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 31, which may have been introduced into the text to make the meaning plain, is ill supported; but the sense requires it to be understood. So far we have a state-merit of the facts of the case. The reason follows. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:30-33 The Gentiles knew not their guilt and misery, therefore were not careful to procure a remedy. Yet they attained to righteousness by faith. Not by becoming proselytes to the Jewish religion, and submitting to the ceremonial law; but by embracing Christ, and believing in him, and submitting to the gospel. The Jews talked much of justification and holiness, and seemed very ambitious to be the favourites of God. They sought, but not in the right way, not in the humbling way, not in the appointed way. Not by faith, not by embracing Christ, depending upon Christ, and submitting to the gospel. They expected justification by observing the precepts and ceremonies of the law of Moses. The unbelieving Jews had a fair offer of righteousness, life, and salvation, made them upon gospel terms, which they did not like, and would not accept. Have we sought to know how we may be justified before God, seeking that blessing in the way here pointed out, by faith in Christ, as the Lord our Righteousness? Then we shall not be ashamed in that awful day, when all refuges of lies shall be swept away, and the Divine wrath shall overflow every hiding-place but that which God hath prepared in his own Son.</body></html>
