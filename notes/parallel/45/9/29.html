The point of the quotation is, that but for this remnant the rejection of Israel would have been utter and complete.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as Esaias hath said before</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in an earlier chapter), <span class="cmt_word">Except the Lord of sabaoth had left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrah</span>. This quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>, and, though it seems to have no obvious reference to the Messianic age, it expresses the same idea as the other, of a remnant only being saved; and it is quoted suitably, occurring as it does at the beginning of the Book of Isaiah, and being a sort of key-note of the prevailing purport of his prophecies. The force of all the above quotations is much enhanced, if we remember that they are not mere isolated texts, but suggestive specimens of many prophetic utterances to the same effect. All familiar with the prophetic writings are aware that main ideas constantly recurring are: First, judgments to come upon the chosen people, painted often in many consecutive verses without relief; but secondly, after such denunciations, a dawn of hope and comfort appearing, and culminating in unutterable blessing under the Messiah's kingdom; and thirdly, this dawn of hope being for a remnant only of the race, compared in one place to a gleaning of the grapes when the vintage is done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>); and fourthly, the association with this remnant, not only of the "outcasts of Israel" gathered from all lands, but also of a multitude of Gentiles, who should be gathered into the Messiah's kingdom (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:25-29 The rejecting of the Jews, and the taking in the Gentiles, were foretold in the Old Testament. It tends very much to the clearing of a truth, to observe how the Scripture is fulfilled in it. It is a wonder of Divine power and mercy that there are any saved: for even those left to be a seed, if God had dealt with them according to their sins, had perished with the rest. This great truth this Scripture teaches us. Even among the vast number of professing Christians it is to be feared that only a remnant will be saved.</body></html>
