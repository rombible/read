It is here typically and prophetically applied to the Gentiles. Those who had ceased to belong to the chosen people, and those who had never belonged to it, were to all intents and purposes in the same position.<p><span class= "bld">Osee.</span>--"It may be questioned whether this word should be pronounced as a dissyllable, the double <span class= "ital">e</span> being regarded as an English termination, as in Zebedee, Pharisee, &c., or as a tri-syllable, the word being considered as a reproduction of the Greek form of the name." (Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">On Revision,</span> p. 156, n.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-29.</span> - (<span class="accented">c</span>) The <span class="accented">inheritance of the promises by the Gentiles, with a remnant only of the Jews, shown to be in accordance with prophecy.</span> This is really a new section of the argument, though the writer, in a way usual with him, does not mark it as such, ver. 25 being in logical connection with the preceding one, suggested by the concluding expression, "Not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles." So far nothing has been adduced to support the idea of <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, to whom no original promises had been made, superseding the Jewish nation in the inheritance, though it had been shown generally that God may have mercy on whom he will; and in the earlier part of the argument (vers. 6-13) all that appeared plainly from the Old Testament was <span class="accented">selection</span> out of the total seed of Abraham - not the calling of a new one apart from his stock. Hence this section is necessary for completing the whole argument. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he saith also in Osee, I will call my people that which was not my people, and beloved her who was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God</span>. The quotation in ver. 26 is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, and is correctly cited; that in ver. 25 is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>, and varies from both the Hebrew and the LXX., but not so as to affect the meaning. Both refer to the same subject. The prophet had been directed to "take unto him a wife of wheredoms." He had so taken "Gomer the daughter of Diblaim," who had borne him a daughter, to whom was given the symbolical name Lo-ruhamah ("Not beloved;" or, as it is interpreted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, "Hath not obtained mercy." "<span class="accented">Love</span> and <span class="accented">mercy</span> are both contained in the full meaning of the intensive form of the Hebrew word," Pusey on 'Hosea '); and afterwards a son, who received the name Lo-ammi ("Not my people"). Both are symbols of the ten tribes of Israel as distinct from Judah; the two names denoting (as Pusey explains) successive stages of God's repudiation of the people, and the last implying entire rejection. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, after the naming of Lo-ammi, it is said, "Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are Lo-ammi, it shall be said unto them, Ye are the children of the living God." The subject is pursued through <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>, at the end of which (ver. 23) comes the other passage quoted: "And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy on Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo-ammi, Ammi ['My people'], and they shall say, My God." It might seem that these quotations are not apposite, since they referred originally, not to the Gentiles, but to the ten tribes of Israel. It is to be observed, however, that the words were spoken after these tribes had been declared to be cut off from being God's people at all, so that a principle of Divine dealing is ex- pressed which is applicable to the Gentile world. "This, which was true of Israel in its dispersion, was much more true of the Gentiles. These, too, the descendants of righteous Noah, God had cast off for the time, that they should be no more his people, when he chose Israel out of them, to make known to them his Being, and his will, and his laws, and (although in shadow and mystery) Christ who was to come. He had threatened to Israel that he should be <span class="accented">unpitied</span>, and no more his people; in reversing his sentence, he embraces in the arms of his mercy all who were not his people, and says to them all, that they should be <span class="accented">my people</span> and <span class="accented">beloved"</span> (Pusey on 'Hosea,' 2:23). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a> the same text from Hosea is quoted as applying to those who were addressed in the Epistle, and then with more obvious applicability; for it appears to have been written, mainly at least, to Israelites of the <span class="accented">dispersion</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>). Still, Gentile converts may be concluded to have been included (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). It is to be observed that in ver. 25 the feminine <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> has reference to the <span class="accented">daughter</span> of the prophet, Lo-ruhamah; and that in ver. 26 "in the place where" must be understood, both in the original prophecy and the application, as meaning any region where those who were to be called <span class="accented">my people</span> might be. "And so St. Peter says that this Scripture, was fulfilled in them, while still <span class="accented">scattered abroad through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.</span> The place, then, where they should be called <span class="accented">the sons of the living God</span> is wheresoever they should believe in Christ" (Pusey). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"'Tis Zion, wheresoe'er they dwell,<br />Who, with his own true Israel,<br />Shall own him strong to save."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Christian Year: Fifth Sunday in Lent.'</span>) The texts from Isaiah which follow are intended to show that, according to prophetic utterance, while those who were not God's people, in large numbers, would be called his people, a <span class="accented">remnant</span> only of the Jews would be so. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:25-29 The rejecting of the Jews, and the taking in the Gentiles, were foretold in the Old Testament. It tends very much to the clearing of a truth, to observe how the Scripture is fulfilled in it. It is a wonder of Divine power and mercy that there are any saved: for even those left to be a seed, if God had dealt with them according to their sins, had perished with the rest. This great truth this Scripture teaches us. Even among the vast number of professing Christians it is to be feared that only a remnant will be saved.</body></html>
