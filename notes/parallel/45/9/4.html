Amen.</span> Here "the adoption" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) means the selection of Israel to be God's peculiar people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>, "Israel is my son, even my firstborn;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>, "Ye are the children of the Lord your God;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>, "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>.

It is, of course, a different idea from that of the spiritual <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of believers (at present as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, or to come as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>), though it might be typical of it. "The glory" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>) seems best explained by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-18</a>, where the visible glory, said to have rested on the mercy-seat and to have illuminated for a time the face of Moses, is regarded as expressing the glory, in a higher sense, of the old dispensation, which, however, was destined to fade away in the greater glory of the revelation of God in Christ. The word may be thus taken to denote, not simply the <span class="accented">Sheehinab</span>, or the glory on Mount Sinai, but rather what was signified by these manifestations. It was probably a recognized term in use with reference to the giving of the Law. "The covenants" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and "the promises" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), both in the plural, include those made with and given to Abraham and the other patriarchs, as well as the Mosaic ones. The former word is wrongly taken by some as denoting the <span class="accented">tables</span> of the covenant. <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is obviously the divinely appointed ceremonial worship, the typical significance of which is explained at length in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the same word is used. "The fathers" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) are the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the original recipients of the promises, descent from whom was made such account of by the Jews, as being the foundation of their privileges (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>; and, for the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in this sense, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). The last and crowning distinction of the Jewish race is mentioned last, viz. the fleshly descent therefrom of Christ, even of him who in his higher nature is "over all, God blessed for ever." This is certainly the most obvious meaning of the conclusion of ver. 5, as far as the language is concerned, and the one understood by all ancient commentators. Some moderns, however, as is well known, have raised objections to this interpretation of the clause, based solely on the supposed improbability that St. Paul would have so designated Christ. Some would, therefore, get over this imagined difficulty by putting a full stop after <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, and taking what follows as a doxology to God the Father, thus: "God, who is over all, be blessed for ever." The apostle is supposed, according to this interpretation, to have been moved to this parenthetical utterance by his contemplation of the Divine favours to Israel, which he had been recounting. Some have suggested the full stop being put after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, so as to refer <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> to Christ, and take only what follows as a doxology, or, as some would have it, as a statement. But, in either case, the idea of so unlikely a breaking up of the sentence may be dismissed as untenable. Others, without thus breaking up the sentence, take the whole of it, beginning with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>, to be, not a doxology, but a statement, thus at- tempting to meet the objection to its being a doxology (to be noticed presently), arising from the collocation of the words. But a mere assertion that God <span class="accented">is</span> blessed for ever would seem peculiarly uncalled for and purposeless here. Meyer, being a critic of deserved repute, and an upholder of the modern interpretation of the clause, taking the whole of it together as a doxology to the Father, it may suffice to state his arguments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That St. Paul, though regarding the Son of God as the image of God, of the essence of God, the agent in creation and preservation, the judge of all, the object of prayer, and the possessor of Divine glory and fulness of grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a>; Philippians it. 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, etc.; Colossians 2:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>), never expressly calls him <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, but always clearly distinguishes him as the <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; and that the passages in which <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> has been supposed by some to apply to him (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>) are wrongly so understood; <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, being also undoubtedly the original reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. (Of St. Paul's usual distinction between <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, when he is referring to the economy of redemption, other instances are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4, 5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4, 5, 6</a>.

Meyer adds in a note, "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a> certainly refers to Christ; but this is just one of the traces of post-apostolic composition. Now, to these arguments it may be replied as follows: To (1) that, though it may be true that St. Paul in no other passage expressly calls Christ <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, yet his doctrine with respect to his Divine nature is in accordance with the expression; for surely the term <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is applicable to him who is spoken of, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, etc.; that his usual distinction between the supreme God and Christ as Mediator by no means precludes his declaring in express terms Christ's essential Deity in a passage where such a declaration is suitable and called for; that even St. John, who is acknowledged by all to have peculiarly set forth the Divine essence of Christ, only once uses the expression, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or any exactly equivalent to it. To argument (2) it may be replied that the language used does <span class="accented">not</span> identify Christ with the Father as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, especially if we suppose a comma after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, so that the meaning would he, "Christ who is over all, God blessed for ever." That Christ is "over all" is what is distinctly declared elsewhere by St. Paul, and <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., may be appended predicatively to denote his Divine essence. As to argument (3), it is necessary to exclude not only 2 Peter and Hebrews, but also 2 Timothy from the list of apostolical writings in order to give it any force. But even so it would be irrelevant; for the sentence before us is not a doxology, but an assertion: it is, according to the ancient interpretation, not "Blessed <span class="accented">be</span> Christ as God for ever;" but" Christ, who is God blessed for ever." The positive reasons for retaining the ancient interpretations may be stated as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Not one of the Greek or other Fathers, or any interpreter before Erasmus, is known to have understood it otherwise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It gives the most obvious sense of the words themselves. It may well be contended that no other would have been thought of, but for the supposed discrepance with the apostle's usual way of speaking of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Whereas a doxology to God the Father does not seem called for here, or to have any very obvious bearing on the writer's train of thought, some assertion of the Divine greatness of Christ seems wanted to complete the representation of the final and crowning privilege of the race of Israel. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would indeed suffice for this purpose, if it could be dissevered from what follows. But, as has been said above, it is not allowable so to break up the sentence. Cf also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, where the statement that Christ had been born of the seed of David, <span class="accented">according to the flesh</span>, is followed by an assertion also of his Divine Sonship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> If the sentence had been intended as a doxology, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> ought properly to have preceded <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>, where the same expression occurs); whereas in every other passage where <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> follows the subject of the sentence, it is an assertion, and not a doxology (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The whole objection to the ancient interpretation rests solely on the views of modern critics as to what they think St. Paul was <span class="accented">likely</span> to mean - not on what his language most obviously intimates that he <span class="accented">did</span> mean - a very unsafe principle of interpretation. Our safe conclusion seems to be that modern criticism has not made out a sufficient case for departing from the unanimous ancient interpretation of this passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 Being about to discuss the rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, and to show that the whole agrees with the sovereign electing love of God, the apostle expresses strongly his affection for his people. He solemnly appeals to Christ; and his conscience, enlightened and directed by the Holy Spirit, bore witness to his sincerity. He would submit to be treated as accursed, to be disgraced, crucified; and even for a time be in the deepest horror and distress; if he could rescue his nation from the destruction about to come upon them for their obstinate unbelief. To be insensible to the eternal condition of our fellow-creatures, is contrary both to the love required by the law, and the mercy of the gospel. They had long been professed worshippers of Jehovah. The law, and the national covenant which was grounded thereon, belonged to them. The temple worship was typical of salvation by the Messiah, and the means of communion with God. All the promises concerning Christ and his salvation were given to them. He is not only over all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed for ever.</body></html>
