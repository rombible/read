It is here to be carefully observed that, though Jacob and Esau were individuals, yet it is not as such, but as the progenitors and representatives of races, that they are here spoken cf. So it was, too, in both the passages quoted from the Old Testament. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a> the words are, "Two <span class="accented">nations</span> are in thy womb, and two <span class="accented">manner of people</span> shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one <span class="accented">people</span> shall be stronger than the other <span class="accented">people</span>; and the elder shall serve the younger." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2</a> the prophet's entire drift is to set forth the Divine favour shown, from the first and still, to the race of Israel as compared with the race of Edom. Hence, as well as from the purport of the chapter as announced at its beginning, it is evident that the subject <span class="accented">of individual</span> predestination does not really come in, as it did in ch. 8, but only that of nations or races of men to a position of privilege as inheritors of promises. It will be seen, also, as we go on, that the introduction in illustration of the case of the individual Pharaoh does not really affect the drift of the chapter as above explained. The strong expression, "Esau I hated" (applicable, as shown above, not to the individual Esau, but to the race of Edom) is capable of being explained as meaning, "I excluded him from the love I showed to Israel." The evidence of such alleged hatred the prophet expresses thus: "and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness;" whereas Israel, it is implied, had been protected from such desolation. As to the necessary force of the word in the Hebrew (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span>), we may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-30.htm">Genesis 29:30, 31</a>, where in ver. 30 it is said that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah, and in ver. 31, as meaning the same thing, that Leah was hated; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15</a>, "If a man have two wives, one beloved and another hated." In both these passages the same verb is used as in Malachi, and need not, in either case, mean more than disregarding one in comparison with another who is loved. For the use, in the New Testament, of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in a sense for the expression of which our English "to hate," in its usual acceptation, is evidently too strong, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a> (to be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>; so also, though not so distinctly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>. It is, moreover, not improbable that the Prophet Malachi, in his patriotic ardour, had in his mind the idea of wrath against the race of Edom on the part of the LORD, as "the people," as he afterwards says, "against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever." But even so, the glowing language of prophets need not be taken as dogmatic assertion; and certainly not as binding us to believe that any race of men is, in the literal sense of the expression, hated of Cod. Such a view is in evident contradiction to the general teaching of Scripture, and notably so to that of St. Paul, who has so emphatically declared that God "made of one blood all nations of men," and is One to all. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-13 The rejection of the Jews by the gospel dispensation, did not break God's promise to the patriarchs. The promises and threatenings shall be fulfilled. Grace does not run in the blood; nor are saving benefits always found with outward church privileges. Not only some of Abraham's seed were chosen, and others not, but God therein wrought according to the counsel of his own will. God foresaw both Esau and Jacob as born in sin, by nature children of wrath even as others. If left to themselves they would have continued in sin through life; but for wise and holy reasons, not made known to us, he purposed to change Jacob's heart, and to leave Esau to his perverseness. This instance of Esau and Jacob throws light upon the Divine conduct to the fallen race of man. The whole Scripture shows the difference between the professed Christian and the real believer. Outward privileges are bestowed on many who are not the children of God. There is, however, full encouragement to diligent use of the means of grace which God has appointed.</body></html>
