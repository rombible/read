The genuineness of the concluding <span class="accented">word</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> here is doubtful. Its omission does not affect the sense. If retained, it must, according to the rule observed in this Exposition, be translated <span class="accented">law</span>, not <span class="accented">the Law.</span> For they stumbled at the stone of stumbling; as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, expressed in the Authorized Version by "whosoever," has no good support, having probably been supplied from ch. 10:11) believeth on him shall not be ashamed. Here, as throughout the Epistle, the apostle's position is supported by an Old Testament reference. In this instance it is to two passages of Isaiah intermingled (Isaiah 28:16 and Isaiah 8:14). The way in which they are fused is illustrative of St. Paul's way, elsewhere apparent, of referring to Scripture. As a rule, he quotes the LXX., but often varies from it, and sometimes so as to be closer to the Hebrew. Sometimes he seems to be quoting from memory, as one who is familiar with the general drift of prophecy on the subject in hand, and satisfied if the form of his quotation expresses such general drift. In the ease before us, he follows the Hebrew in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>:14, and the LXX. 2:28:16, where for the Hebrew expression rendered "shall not make haste," the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, apparently with the same essential meaning; for "make haste" seems to signify "haste away in terror and confusion." The two texts combined express the idea of a stone being laid by the Lord in Zion, which should be the support of the faithful, but a stumbling-block to others. It is not necessary to inquire whether the texts themselves have in the original any obvious Messianic reference. Enough that they denote God's plan of dealing with his people. But to understand the full idea in the apostle's mind, when he speaks of "the stone of stumbling," we must take into account also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, and our Lord's language, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42, 44</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-17.htm">Luke 20:17, 18</a>. In the Psalms we find the figure of "the stone" used thus: "The stone which the builders refused is become the head <span class="accented">stone</span> of the corner;" and in the Gospels our Lord refers to this text as de. noting himself, and subjoins, with reference to Isaiah, the idea of the same stone being one on which some should fall and be broken, with the additional conception of its crushing those on whom itself should fall. The same view essentially is expressed in Simeon's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>), that "this Child" should be for the fall as well as for the rising again of many in Israel; and it is repeated definitely in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:30-33 The Gentiles knew not their guilt and misery, therefore were not careful to procure a remedy. Yet they attained to righteousness by faith. Not by becoming proselytes to the Jewish religion, and submitting to the ceremonial law; but by embracing Christ, and believing in him, and submitting to the gospel. The Jews talked much of justification and holiness, and seemed very ambitious to be the favourites of God. They sought, but not in the right way, not in the humbling way, not in the appointed way. Not by faith, not by embracing Christ, depending upon Christ, and submitting to the gospel. They expected justification by observing the precepts and ceremonies of the law of Moses. The unbelieving Jews had a fair offer of righteousness, life, and salvation, made them upon gospel terms, which they did not like, and would not accept. Have we sought to know how we may be justified before God, seeking that blessing in the way here pointed out, by faith in Christ, as the Lord our Righteousness? Then we shall not be ashamed in that awful day, when all refuges of lies shall be swept away, and the Divine wrath shall overflow every hiding-place but that which God hath prepared in his own Son.</body></html>
