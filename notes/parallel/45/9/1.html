But it was a subject too deeply fixed in St. Paul's mind to be left unnoticed. And besides, what he had said at the beginning of his treatise, and afterwards implied, seemed to call for some explanation in the face of existing facts. For he had said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>), that the gospel "was the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; <span class="accented">to the Jew first</span>, and also to the Gentile;" and throughout he has regarded it as the fulfilment of the peculiar promises made to the Jews themselves, who were to have precedence, though not monopoly, in the inheritance of its blessings. How, then, was this view consistent with the fact that the Jews in general, even more than any others, were now <span class="accented">excluded</span> from this inheritance? The apostle has already, even in the course of his argument, paused to meet certain supposed difficulties of this kind in the short section, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1-8</a>; but now he takes up the whole subject formally, and considers it in all its bearings. First, in ch. 9, he expresses his deep sorrow for the fact; but shows it to be not inconsistent either with God's faithfulness to his promise, or with his justice, or with the Word of prophecy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing witness with me in the Holy Ghost</span>. For similar solemn asseverations by St. Paul of the truth of what was known to himself alone, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>. The peculiar solemnity of this may be due to the peculiar depth of his feelings on the subject. It is not <span class="accented">necessary</span> to suppose him to be moved by a fear of his patriotic enthusiasm being doubted, now that he had turned Christian, and argued so strongly against Jewish monopoly of privilege But it may have been so. For the force of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; ch. 12:19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>. It is not an adjuration, but denotes the element in which he moves and speaks. Similarly, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span> following (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>), which, of course, could not be on oath. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 Being about to discuss the rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, and to show that the whole agrees with the sovereign electing love of God, the apostle expresses strongly his affection for his people. He solemnly appeals to Christ; and his conscience, enlightened and directed by the Holy Spirit, bore witness to his sincerity. He would submit to be treated as accursed, to be disgraced, crucified; and even for a time be in the deepest horror and distress; if he could rescue his nation from the destruction about to come upon them for their obstinate unbelief. To be insensible to the eternal condition of our fellow-creatures, is contrary both to the love required by the law, and the mercy of the gospel. They had long been professed worshippers of Jehovah. The law, and the national covenant which was grounded thereon, belonged to them. The temple worship was typical of salvation by the Messiah, and the means of communion with God. All the promises concerning Christ and his salvation were given to them. He is not only over all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed for ever.</body></html>
