And this is divided into three parts. Part 1 extends to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-13.htm" title="As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.">Romans 9:13</a>, and the object of it is to clear the way by defining the true limits of the promise. It was not really to <span class= "ital">all</span> Israel that the promise was given, but only to a particular section of Israel.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Not as though.</span>--The scholar will observe that there appears to be here a mixture of two constructions, "the case is not such that," and "I do not mean to say that," "I do not intend to say that the case is such as that."<p><span class= "bld">Taken none effect.</span>--"Fallen through," or "failed of its accomplishment."<p><span class= "bld">Of Israel</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> descended from Jacob. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm" title="And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.">Genesis 32:28</a>.) The promise of God was indeed given to Israel, but that did not mean roundly all who could claim descent from Jacob without further limitation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - (2) (<span class="accented">a</span>) After this avowal of his deep sorrow, and his reasons for feeling it, the apostle now proceeds to deal with the subject. First (as has been said above) he shows (vers. 6-13) that the present exclusion of the great majority of the Jews from Christian privileges does not imply any <span class="accented">unfaithfulness</span> on God's part to his ancient promises; and thus it follows that the fact of their exclusion is no proof of the gospel not being the true fulfilment of those promises. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it is not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect</span> (or, <span class="accented">hath come to naught</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For they are not all Israel who are of Israel: neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called</span>. The promises to the patriarchs never, from the first, implied the inheritance of them by all the physical descendants of those patriarchs; even in Israel there is a recognized distinction between being of the race of Israel and being the true Israel of God; in the original promise to Abraham the descendants of Ishmael (though equally with those of Isaac, his physical seed) were excluded. And so even the race of Israel is but a part of the whole seed of Abraham, to whom the promise was made. Hence it follows that the present exclusion of the majority of even the race of Israel from the inheritance of the promises is not inconsistent with the original purport of those promises. The quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>, "In Isaac," etc., is properly (as in the original Hebrew) "In Isaac shall a seed be named to thee;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "In Isaac it shall come to pass that posterity of thine shall have the name and position of <span class="accented">the seed of Abraham</span>, and be recognized as the inheritors of the promise" (Meyer). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:6-13 The rejection of the Jews by the gospel dispensation, did not break God's promise to the patriarchs. The promises and threatenings shall be fulfilled. Grace does not run in the blood; nor are saving benefits always found with outward church privileges. Not only some of Abraham's seed were chosen, and others not, but God therein wrought according to the counsel of his own will. God foresaw both Esau and Jacob as born in sin, by nature children of wrath even as others. If left to themselves they would have continued in sin through life; but for wise and holy reasons, not made known to us, he purposed to change Jacob's heart, and to leave Esau to his perverseness. This instance of Esau and Jacob throws light upon the Divine conduct to the fallen race of man. The whole Scripture shows the difference between the professed Christian and the real believer. Outward privileges are bestowed on many who are not the children of God. There is, however, full encouragement to diligent use of the means of grace which God has appointed.</body></html>
