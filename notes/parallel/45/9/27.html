St. Paul has followed the LXX. in putting the consequences of such conversion for the conversion itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - Esaias also crieth (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, denoting loud and earnest utterance; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm">Acts 24:21</a>) concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant (not, as in the Authorized Version, "a remnant." The idea seems to be, as it is in the original, that <span class="accented">it is the remnant only that</span>) <span class="accented">shall</span> be saved: for he will finish a word (not <span class="accented">the work</span>, as in the Authorized Version) and cut it short: because a short (rather, <span class="accented">cut-short</span>) word (again, not <span class="accented">work</span>) <span class="accented">will</span> the Lord make (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> accomplish) upon the earth. The Greek of ver. 28, according to the Textus Receptus, is difficult, so as to have compelled our translators to render the participles <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> by futures, "will finish," etc. But we have the high and early authority of the uncials <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, for omitting part of the sentence, so as to make it read more intelligibly, thus: <span class="accented">The Lord will make</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> accomplish) <span class="accented">a word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.</span> The longer form, however, agrees, though not quite exactly, with the LXX., which differs itself greatly from the Hebrew, though not so as to affect the main drift of the passage as a whole. The passage is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, which had primary reference to the remnant of the house of Israel that should "return unto the mighty God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>) after the then predicted devastation of the nation by the Assyrian king. The series of prophecies with which this is connected begins at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, which gives an account of Isaiah's memorable visit to Ahaz King of Judah, on the occasion of the combination of Pekah King of Israel, and Rezin King of Syria, against Jerusalem, in the course of which visit he predicts the birth of Immanuel. He took with him his son, who bore the symbolical name of Shear-jashub ("A remnant shall return"). Subsequently another son was born to the prophet, to whom was given the name Maher-shalal-hash-baz ("Swift of spoil, hasty of prey," as Ewald renders; or, "The spoil speedeth, the prey hasteth," as in margin of the Revised Version); the latter name having been previously written on a great roll (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>). The primary drift of the prophecies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>. and the following chapters is that the confederacy of Pekah and Reziu against Jerusalem shall fail, that their own lands would ere long be devastated by the Assyrian king, who would sweep irresistibly over Judah too; but that God's people may still trust in the LORD'S protection, who would preserve and bring back a remnant, though a remnant only. The three names, Maher-shalal-hash-baz, Shear-jashub, and Immanuel ("God with us"), are throughout significant of the leading ideas of the whole series of predictions; the first expressing the certainty of coming judgment, the second the return of the remnant, and the third God's own presence with his people. Now, without pausing to consider what primary historical fulfilment of the prophecy about Immanuel there might be in the way of type, we cannot but perceive, in the language and tone of much in this series of prophecies, a distinct Messianic reference. We cannot, for instance, otherwise understand <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>. there succeeds an ideal picture of peace and blessing under the "rod out of the stem of Jesse," which is undoubtedly Messianic. Hence the relevance of the passage, not only as showing God's way of dealing with his people in times of old, but also as an intimation of how it should be when the Messiah should come. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:25-29 The rejecting of the Jews, and the taking in the Gentiles, were foretold in the Old Testament. It tends very much to the clearing of a truth, to observe how the Scripture is fulfilled in it. It is a wonder of Divine power and mercy that there are any saved: for even those left to be a seed, if God had dealt with them according to their sins, had perished with the rest. This great truth this Scripture teaches us. Even among the vast number of professing Christians it is to be feared that only a remnant will be saved.</body></html>
