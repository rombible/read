Trinitarian and English interpreters, as a rule, take them with the punctuation of the Authorised version, as referring to Christ. Socinian interpreters, with some of the most eminent among the Germans, put a full stop after "came," and make the remainder of the verse a doxology addressed to God, "Blessed for ever be God, who is over all." Both ways are possible. The question is, Which is the most natural and probable? and this is to be considered, putting altogether on one side prepossessions of every kind. We are not to read meaning <span class= "ital">into</span> Scripture, but to elicit meaning <span class= "ital">from</span> it. The balance of the argument stands thus:--(1) The order of the words is somewhat in favour of the application to Christ. If the clause had really been a formal doxology, the ascription of blessing would more naturally have come at the beginning in Greek as in English, "Blessed be God," &c. (2) The context is also somewhat in favour of this application. The break in the form of the sentence becomes rather abrupt on the other hypothesis, and is not to be quite paralleled. Intruded doxologies, caused by a sudden access of pious feeling, are not uncommon in the writings of St. Paul, but they are either worked into the regular order of the sentence, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm" title="To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Galatians 1:5</a>, or else they are formally introduced as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1Timothy 1:17</a>. (3) But on the other hand, to set somewhat decidedly against this application, is the fact that the words used by the Apostle, "Who is over all," and the ascription of blessing in all other places where they occur, are referred, not to Christ, but to God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-6.htm" title="One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.">Ephesians 4:6</a>.) There is, indeed, a doxology addressed to Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm" title="And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">2Timothy 4:18</a>; it should, however, be remembered that the Pauline origin of that Epistle has been doubted by some, though it is also right to add that these doubts do not appear to have any real validity. The title "God" does not appear to be elsewhere applied to our Lord by St. Paul, though all the attributes of Godhead are ascribed to Him: <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, which would be an apparent exception, the true reading is, * Who was manifested," and not "God was manifested." On the other hand, St. John certainly makes use of this title, not only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>, but also in the reading, adopted by many, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>, "God only begotten" for "Only begotten Son." Weighing the whole of the arguments against each other, the <span class= "ital">data</span> do not seem to be sufficient to warrant a positive and dogmatic conclusion either way. The application to our Lord appears perhaps a little the more probable of the two. More than this cannot be said. Nor is a stronger affirmation warranted by any considerations resting on the division of authorities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 Being about to discuss the rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, and to show that the whole agrees with the sovereign electing love of God, the apostle expresses strongly his affection for his people. He solemnly appeals to Christ; and his conscience, enlightened and directed by the Holy Spirit, bore witness to his sincerity. He would submit to be treated as accursed, to be disgraced, crucified; and even for a time be in the deepest horror and distress; if he could rescue his nation from the destruction about to come upon them for their obstinate unbelief. To be insensible to the eternal condition of our fellow-creatures, is contrary both to the love required by the law, and the mercy of the gospel. They had long been professed worshippers of Jehovah. The law, and the national covenant which was grounded thereon, belonged to them. The temple worship was typical of salvation by the Messiah, and the means of communion with God. All the promises concerning Christ and his salvation were given to them. He is not only over all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed for ever.</body></html>
