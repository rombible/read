Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same</span>. It is the theory of the laws of all civilized governments to uphold justice, and only to punish what is wrong; and in the main they do so. The principles of the Roman law were just, and Paul himself found protection from its officers and tribunals, whose fairness he had, and had reason to have, more confidence in than in the tender mercy of either Gentile or Jewish zealots (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 21:31, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 22:30; 24:10; 25:10, 11; 26:30, <span class="accented">seq.</span>). As has been observed already, the Neronian persecutions had not yet begun. <span class="cmt_word">For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain</span> (though "the sword" might possibly be understood as only the familiar symbol of power, yet the mention of it may be taken to imply the apostle's recognition of the legitimacy of capital punishment, such as he also expressed distinctly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>): <span class="cmt_word">for he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</span> <span class="accented">Wrath</span> here expresses the familiar idea of the Divine wrath against evil-doing, for the execution of which, in the sphere of human law, the magistrate is the appointed instrument (see note on Romans 12:19). <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake</span>. Not only for fear of penal consequences, but because it is your duty, whatever might ensue, to submit to the ordinance of God. Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>, submission to every ordinance of man is enjoined "for the Lord's sake (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 The grace of the gospel teaches us submission and quiet, where pride and the carnal mind only see causes for murmuring and discontent. Whatever the persons in authority over us themselves may be, yet the just power they have, must be submitted to and obeyed. In the general course of human affairs, rulers are not a terror to honest, quiet, and good subjects, but to evil-doers. Such is the power of sin and corruption, that many will be kept back from crimes only by the fear of punishment. Thou hast the benefit of the government, therefore do what thou canst to preserve it, and nothing to disturb it. This directs private persons to behave quietly and peaceably where God has set them, 1Ti 2:1,2. Christians must not use any trick or fraud. All smuggling, dealing in contraband goods, withholding or evading duties, is rebellion against the express command of God. Thus honest neighbours are robbed, who will have to pay the more; and the crimes of smugglers, and others who join with them, are abetted. It is painful that some professors of the gospel should countenance such dishonest practices. The lesson here taught it becomes all Christians to learn and practise, that the godly in the land will always be found the quiet and the peaceable in the land, whatever others are.</body></html>
