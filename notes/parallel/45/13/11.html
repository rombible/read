The end of the world itself is near.<p>St. Paul, like the other Apostles (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm" title="But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch to prayer.">1Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly.

This was in strict accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>, and resulted naturally from the peculiar form of the Jewish Messianic expectation. A great shock had been given to the disciples by the crucifixion of Him whom they thought to be the Messiah, and though they began to recover from this as soon as they were convinced of His resurrection, they yet could not reconcile themselves to it entirely. The humiliation of the cross was still a stumbling-block to them <span class= "ital">taken alone,</span> but falling back upon another portion of their beliefs, they looked to see it supplemented, and its shameful side cancelled, by a second coming "in power and great glory." Their previous expectations, vague as they were, led them to regard this as part of the one manifestation of the Messiah, and they did not expect to see a long interval of time interposed.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">And that, knowing the time.</span>--And that there is all the more urgent motive for you to do--this law of love it is the more incumbent on you to practise--because you know what a critical moment it is in which you are living.

The true, the genuine Christian life is like the state of a man whose eyes are open and whose faculties are all alert and vigorous. All besides, whatever it be, the state of heathenism or of imperfect and lukewarm Christianity, is like the torpor of sleep.<p><span class= "bld">Our salvation.</span>--That blissful participation in His kingdom which the Messiah at His Second Coming should inaugurate for His people.

There can be little, if any, doubt that the apostle had in view the second coming of Christ, which he with others supposed might be close at hand, Our Lord had said that of that day none knew but the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), and that it would come unexpectedly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27, 37-44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-36.htm">Mark 13:36</a>). Further, in the same addresses to the disciples before his death in which these things were said, he seems to have disclosed a vista of the future, after the manner of the ancient prophets, in which more immediate and more distant fulfilments of the prophetic vision were not clearly distinguished; so that words which we now perceive to have pointed to the destruction of Jerusalem, which was typical of the final judgments, might easily have been understood as referring to the latter. Such are, "This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-30.htm">Mark 13:30</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-22.htm">John 21:22, 23</a>). Hence it was natural that the apostolic Church should regard the second advent as probably imminent. We find in the apostolic Epistles several intimations of this expectation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-2.htm">2 Corinthians 5:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-5.htm">Philippians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>); and though it was not realized in the event, the authority of the apostles as inspired teachers is not thus disparaged, this being the very thing which Christ had said must remain unknown to all. Nor does their teaching, enforced by this expectation, lose its force to us; for, though "the Lord delayeth his coming," and may still delay it, yet to each of us at least this present world is fast passing away, and the Lord may be close at hand to call us out of it. The duty of watchfulness and preparedness remains unchanged. The <span class="accented">Parousia</span> or, as it is called in the pastoral Epistles, the <span class="accented">Epiphany</span> (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) of Christ is here, as elsewhere, presented under the figure of the day appearing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>; l Thessalonians 5:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>), the previous ages of the world being regarded as the time of night. The figure is found in the prophets with reference to <span class="accented">that day - the</span> coming <span class="accented">day of the Lord</span> (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>), But though the <span class="accented">day</span> has not yet come, Christians are viewed as already in the radiance of its dawn, in which they can walk as children of the day, and be on the watch, and not be surprised asleep, or doing the deeds of darkness, when the full daylight bursts upon them. For in the first advent of Christ the day dawned, though, to those who loved darkness rather than light, but as a light that shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, seq.; John 3:19, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-8.htm">1 John 2:8</a>; and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>, seq.; Luke 2:32). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that</span> (for a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-8.htm">1 Corinthians 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-28.htm">Philippians 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a><span class="cmt_word">), knowing that it is high time for you to awake out of sleep</span> (more literally, <span class="accented">that it is the hour for you to be already roused out of sleep</span>); <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for now is our salvation nearer</span> (or, <span class="accented">now is salvation nearer to</span> us.

Time has been gradually advancing since then, bringing the consummation we look for ever nearer). <span class="cmt_word">The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light</span>. Former habits of life are here, as elsewhere, regarded as clothing once worn - a man's habitual investment, though not part of his real self - which is to be <span class="accented">put off</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8, 9</a>); instead whereof are to he <span class="accented">put</span> on, as a new investment, the graces and virtues, supplied to us from the region of light, which constitute the Christian character (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, seq.). In all these passages the new clothing to be put on is designated as armour, the idea being carried out in detail in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, etc.; and thus the further conception is introduced of Christians being as soldiers on the watch during the watches of the night, awaiting daybreak, equipped with arms of heavenly proof, careful not to sleep on their post, or to allow themselves in revelry or any deeds of shame, such as are done in the night under the cover of darkness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:11-14 Four things are here taught, as a Christian's directory for his day's work. When to awake; Now; and to awake out of the sleep of carnal security, sloth, and negligence; out of the sleep of spiritual death, and out of the sleep of spiritual deadness. Considering the time; a busy time; a perilous time. Also the salvation nigh at hand. Let us mind our way, and mend our pace, we are nearer our journey's end. Also to make ourselves ready. The night is far spent, the day is at hand; therefore it is time to dress ourselves. Observe what we must put off; clothes worn in the night. Cast off the sinful works of darkness. Observe what we must put on; how we should dress our souls. Put on the armour of light. A Christian must reckon himself undressed, if unarmed. The graces of the Spirit are this armour, to secure the soul from Satan's temptations, and the assaults of this present evil world. Put on Christ; that includes all. Put on righteousness of Christ, for justification. Put on the Spirit and grace of Christ, for sanctification. The Lord Jesus Christ must be put on as Lord to rule you as Jesus to save you; and in both, as Christ anointed and appointed by the Father to this ruling, saving work. And how to walk. When we are up and ready, we are not to sit still, but to appear abroad; let us walk. Christianity teaches us how to walk so as to please God, who ever sees us. Walk honestly as in the day; avoiding the works of darkness. Where there are riot and drunkenness, there usually are chambering and wantonness, and strife and envy. Solomon puts these all together, Pr 23:29-35. See what provision to make. Our great care must be to provide for our souls: but must we take no care about our bodies? Yes; but two things are forbidden. Perplexing ourselves with anxious, encumbering care; and indulging ourselves in irregular desires. Natural wants are to be answered, but evil appetites must be checked and denied. To ask meat for our necessities, is our duty, we are taught to pray for daily bread; but to ask meat for our lusts, is provoking God, Ps 78:18.</body></html>
