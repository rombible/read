"Nam mortem pro salute nostra obeundo dominium sibi acquisivit quod nec morte solveretur; resurgendo autem totam vitam nostram in peculium accepit; morte igitur et resurrectione sua promeritus est ut tam in morte quam in vita gloriae nominis ejus serviamus" (Calvin). For the idea of this whole passage (vers. 7-9), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-15.htm">2 Corinthians 5:15</a>. The apostle now returns to his immediate subject, warning (as in ver. 3) the one party against <span class="accented">judging</span> and the other against <span class="accented">despising</span>, on the ground of all alike having to abide hereafter the Divine judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3, 5</a>).

No one who has given up his name to Christ, is allowedly a self-seeker; that is against true Christianity. The business of our lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God. That is true Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. Though Christians are of different strength, capacities, and practices in lesser things, yet they are all the Lord's; all are looking and serving, and approving themselves to Christ. He is Lord of those that are living, to rule them; of those that are dead, to revive them, and raise them up. Christians should not judge or despise one another, because both the one and the other must shortly give an account. A believing regard to the judgment of the great day, would silence rash judgings. Let every man search his own heart and life; he that is strict in judging and humbling himself, will not be apt to judge and despise his brother. We must take heed of saying or doing things which may cause others to stumble or to fall. The one signifies a lesser, the other a greater degree of offence; that which may be an occasion of grief or of guilt to our brother.</body></html>
