These are crowned in the confirmed Christian by that feeling of subdued and chastened exultation which is wrought in Him by the presence in his heart or constant influence of the Holy Spirit.<p>It is remarkable how, with all the wide difference in terminology between the writings of St. Paul and the Gospels, they yet come round to the very same point. The "kingdom of God," as here described, is exactly what we should gather from the fuller and more detailed sayings of our Lord. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man;" "The kingdom of God is within you;" "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation;" "If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light;" "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness;" "Blessed are the peacemakers;" "Rejoice and be exceeding glad."<p>It has not been beyond the power of heathen or even Christian philosophers, such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as Marcus Aurelius, to arrive at the conception of righteousness and peaceableness as duties to be observed and striven after. The peculiarity of Christianity consists in the unity which it gives to these attributes as naturally flowing from a spring of deep religious emotion, and from the finish and perfection which it adds to them by the introduction of that third term, "joy in the Holy Ghost." Many individuals have shown, and still show, with greater or less approximation, what the Christian type should be, but the great and only perfect Exemplar is Jesus Himself, and that less, perhaps, in the later portion of His career, when He was fulfilling that other side of His mission, to "bear the sins of many" as the Saviour of mankind, than in the earlier untroubled phase which finds expression in the Sermon on the Mount. This is in closest contact with the normal life of men.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.

It is the practical fruits of faith that commend it to men, as well as being the test of its genuineness before God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:14-18 Christ deals gently with those who have true grace, though they are weak in it. Consider the design of Christ's death: also that drawing a soul to sin, threatens the destruction of that soul. Did Christ deny himself for our brethren, so as to die for them, and shall not we deny ourselves for them, so as to keep from any indulgence? We cannot hinder ungoverned tongues from speaking evil; but we must not give them any occasion. We must deny ourselves in many cases what we may lawfully do, when our doing it may hurt our good name. Our good often comes to be evil spoken of, because we use lawful things in an uncharitable and selfish manner. As we value the reputation of the good we profess and practise, let us seek that it may not be evil-spoken of. Righteousness, peace, and joy, are words that mean a great deal. As to God, our great concern is to appear before him justified by Christ's death, sanctified by the Spirit of his grace; for the righteous Lord loveth righteousness. As to our brethren, it is to live in peace, and love, and charity with them; following peace with all men. As to ourselves, it is joy in the Holy Ghost; that spiritual joy wrought by the blessed Spirit in the hearts of believers, which respects God as their reconciled Father, and heaven as their expected home. Regard to Christ in doing our duties, alone can make them acceptable. Those are most pleasing to God that are best pleased with him; and they abound most in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. They are approved by wise and good men; and the opinion of others is not to be regarded.</body></html>
