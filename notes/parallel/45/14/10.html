For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God</span> (so, rather than <span class="accented">of Christ</span>, as in the Textus Receptus). <span class="cmt_word">For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, quoted very freely from the LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

In all that follows St. Paul returns exclusively to the more enlightened ones, whose feelings were in accordance with his own; and he now presses a further thought upon them, namely of the harm they might be doing to the very souls of the weak ones by tempting them, either by word or example, to disobey their own consciences. <span class="cmt_word">But judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumbling-block in his brother's way, or an occasion of falling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).

No one who has given up his name to Christ, is allowedly a self-seeker; that is against true Christianity. The business of our lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God. That is true Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. Though Christians are of different strength, capacities, and practices in lesser things, yet they are all the Lord's; all are looking and serving, and approving themselves to Christ. He is Lord of those that are living, to rule them; of those that are dead, to revive them, and raise them up. Christians should not judge or despise one another, because both the one and the other must shortly give an account. A believing regard to the judgment of the great day, would silence rash judgings. Let every man search his own heart and life; he that is strict in judging and humbling himself, will not be apt to judge and despise his brother. We must take heed of saying or doing things which may cause others to stumble or to fall. The one signifies a lesser, the other a greater degree of offence; that which may be an occasion of grief or of guilt to our brother.</body></html>
