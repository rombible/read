If any judgment is to be formed at all, let it be rather as a principle to guide our own action, and not in the shape of a criticism upon others. This principle, in the case of those who are themselves liberal and large-minded, should be not to put temptation in the way of their weaker brethren.<p><span class= "bld">Stumblingblock or an occasion to fall.</span>--The same words that occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>. That translated "occasion to fall," is the origin of our word "scandal." It is properly a trap or snare. Both the idea and the word are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-6.htm" title="But whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.">Matthew 18:6</a> (= <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-42.htm" title="And whoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.">Mark 9:42</a>), where it is disguised by the translation "offend," in the sense of "cause to stumble." The same translation appears frequently elsewhere. One of the special characteristics of Christianity is its tenderness for the weak<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:7-13 Though some are weak, and others are strong, yet all must agree not to live to themselves. No one who has given up his name to Christ, is allowedly a self-seeker; that is against true Christianity. The business of our lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God. That is true Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. Though Christians are of different strength, capacities, and practices in lesser things, yet they are all the Lord's; all are looking and serving, and approving themselves to Christ. He is Lord of those that are living, to rule them; of those that are dead, to revive them, and raise them up. Christians should not judge or despise one another, because both the one and the other must shortly give an account. A believing regard to the judgment of the great day, would silence rash judgings. Let every man search his own heart and life; he that is strict in judging and humbling himself, will not be apt to judge and despise his brother. We must take heed of saying or doing things which may cause others to stumble or to fall. The one signifies a lesser, the other a greater degree of offence; that which may be an occasion of grief or of guilt to our brother.</body></html>
