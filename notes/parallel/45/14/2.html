Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him</span>. "He that eateth" is the one that has faith to eat all things; and it is against <span class="accented">contempt</span> on his part of the weak in faith that the admonition is mainly directed throughout the chapter (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>). But the weak require an admonition too. Their temptation was <span class="accented">to judge</span> those who indulged in freedom which to themselves appeared unlawful; and here, in ver. 5, the apostle gives such as did so a sharp reproof. There is a tone of indignation in his <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; reminding us of his tone towards the Judaists in Galatia, who would have crippled Christian liberty. "God hath received him" refers evidently, as appears from its position and from the following verse, to <span class="accented">him that eateth.</span> God hath received him to himself in Christ, whosoever may sit in judgment on him. We observe that the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is the same as in ver. 1 and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 Differences of opinion prevailed even among the immediate followers of Christ and their disciples. Nor did St. Paul attempt to end them. Compelled assent to any doctrine, or conformity to outward observances without being convinced, would be hypocritical and of no avail. Attempts for producing absolute oneness of mind among Christians would be useless. Let not Christian fellowship be disturbed with strifes of words. It will be good for us to ask ourselves, when tempted to disdain and blame our brethren; Has not God owned them? and if he has, dare I disown them? Let not the Christian who uses his liberty, despise his weak brother as ignorant and superstitious. Let not the scrupulous believer find fault with his brother, for God accepted him, without regarding the distinctions of meats. We usurp the place of God, when we take upon us thus to judge the thoughts and intentions of others, which are out of our view. The case as to the observance of days was much the same. Those who knew that all these things were done away by Christ's coming, took no notice of the festivals of the Jews. But it is not enough that our consciences consent to what we do; it is necessary that it be certified from the word of God. Take heed of acting against a doubting conscience. We are all apt to make our own views the standard of truth, to deem things certain which to others appear doubtful. Thus Christians often despise or condemn each other, about doubtful matters of no moment. A thankful regard to God, the Author and Giver of all our mercies, sanctifies and sweetens them.</body></html>
