From these passages, taken together, it is clear that the observance of special days has no absolute sanction, but is purely a question of religious expediency. That, however, is sufficient ground on which to rest it, and experience seems in favour of some such system as that adopted by our own Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike</span> (literally, <span class="accented">one judgeth day beyond -</span> or, <span class="accented">in comparison with - day: another judgeth every day.</span> For <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "estimate," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-8.htm">Acts 26:8</a>. For sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> with accusative, cf. 1:25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-2.htm">Luke 13:2</a>. <span class="accented">Days</span> being here only briefly referred to in a chapter the main subject of which is <span class="accented">meats</span>, some have supposed <span class="accented">fast-days</span> only to be meant; in which case the sense might be that some make it a necessary point of conscience to abstain from food, or from certain kinds of food, on particular days, while others make no such distinction between days as a matter of essential import. But a comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm">Galatians 4:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a> suggests rather a general reference to days of observance under the Jewish Law. The same class of weak brethren with Jewish prejudices that was scrupulous about meats would be likely to be also scrupulous about days and seasons and if scruples on the latter head seem to be mentioned only incidentally in this chapter, it may be because the others were at that time mainly conspicuous, and threatening to disturb the peace of the Church. One view that has been taken is that this short allusion to observance of days is introduced only in the way of illustration and argument; it being supposed that difference of practice with regard to days <span class="accented">was</span> allowed without dispute, and that what St. Paul means to say is, "You do exercise mutual tolerance in this matter extend the same principle to the matter of meats, to which it is equally applicable. This view of the meaning of the passage would derive support from the reading of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> at the beginning of ver. 5, which rests on fair authority. The supposed reference to Jewish days of obligation in general is.. not inconsistent with the apparent condemnation of the observance of such days by Christians in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4.htm">Galatians 4</a>. and Colossians it. For see what has been said above about the drift of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a> and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>, etc. When the observances came to be insisted on as obligatory on principle, it was a different thing from mere conscientious scrupulosity. <span class="cmt_word">Let every man be fully persuaded</span> (for the verb in this sense, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>) <span class="cmt_word">in his own mind</span>. To St. Paul himself the observance or non-observance of the days referred to was a matter in itself of no importance. He was content that each person should act up to his own conscientious convictions on the subject. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 Differences of opinion prevailed even among the immediate followers of Christ and their disciples. Nor did St. Paul attempt to end them. Compelled assent to any doctrine, or conformity to outward observances without being convinced, would be hypocritical and of no avail. Attempts for producing absolute oneness of mind among Christians would be useless. Let not Christian fellowship be disturbed with strifes of words. It will be good for us to ask ourselves, when tempted to disdain and blame our brethren; Has not God owned them? and if he has, dare I disown them? Let not the Christian who uses his liberty, despise his weak brother as ignorant and superstitious. Let not the scrupulous believer find fault with his brother, for God accepted him, without regarding the distinctions of meats. We usurp the place of God, when we take upon us thus to judge the thoughts and intentions of others, which are out of our view. The case as to the observance of days was much the same. Those who knew that all these things were done away by Christ's coming, took no notice of the festivals of the Jews. But it is not enough that our consciences consent to what we do; it is necessary that it be certified from the word of God. Take heed of acting against a doubting conscience. We are all apt to make our own views the standard of truth, to deem things certain which to others appear doubtful. Thus Christians often despise or condemn each other, about doubtful matters of no moment. A thankful regard to God, the Author and Giver of all our mercies, sanctifies and sweetens them.</body></html>
