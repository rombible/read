For one of his intense penetration and grasp on the realities of things, any other position was impossible. But while these essential features in the Apostle's character find the noblest expression, we cannot but note his attitude of gentle forbearance towards those whose faith is less deep and less robust than his own. This comes out especially in that pathetic and pregnant appeal, "Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died."<p><span class= "bld">By the Lord Jesus.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in the Lord Jesus.</span> A solemn form of asseveration. The Apostle is speaking from the very depths of his Christian consciousness as one who knows that he has himself put on the Spirit of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">To him that esteemeth.</span>--This would mean, in philosophical language, that the quality of uncleanness was not an objective property in the thing itself, but a subjective quality in the mind of the person regarding it as such. Still, this subjective quality is for the individual a real one, and should be treated as real. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-15.htm" title="There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.">Mark 7:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus</span> (I myself know it; my very faith in Jesus carries to me the conviction of it; I do not hesitate to declare my own decided view, that the scruples of these weak brethren are unfounded) <span class="cmt_word">that there is nothing unclean of itself</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>); <span class="cmt_word">save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean</span>. To him it becomes defiling, because partaking of it defiles his conscience (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:14-18 Christ deals gently with those who have true grace, though they are weak in it. Consider the design of Christ's death: also that drawing a soul to sin, threatens the destruction of that soul. Did Christ deny himself for our brethren, so as to die for them, and shall not we deny ourselves for them, so as to keep from any indulgence? We cannot hinder ungoverned tongues from speaking evil; but we must not give them any occasion. We must deny ourselves in many cases what we may lawfully do, when our doing it may hurt our good name. Our good often comes to be evil spoken of, because we use lawful things in an uncharitable and selfish manner. As we value the reputation of the good we profess and practise, let us seek that it may not be evil-spoken of. Righteousness, peace, and joy, are words that mean a great deal. As to God, our great concern is to appear before him justified by Christ's death, sanctified by the Spirit of his grace; for the righteous Lord loveth righteousness. As to our brethren, it is to live in peace, and love, and charity with them; following peace with all men. As to ourselves, it is joy in the Holy Ghost; that spiritual joy wrought by the blessed Spirit in the hearts of believers, which respects God as their reconciled Father, and heaven as their expected home. Regard to Christ in doing our duties, alone can make them acceptable. Those are most pleasing to God that are best pleased with him; and they abound most in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. They are approved by wise and good men; and the opinion of others is not to be regarded.</body></html>
