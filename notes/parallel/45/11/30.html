The substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which follows twice, should be translated "disobedience" rather than "unbelief," if <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is translated "disobeyed." Properly and usually <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> conveys a different idea from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, denoting "disobedience" or "contumacy," and not merely want of faith. But it appears to be sometimes used in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. For instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> is opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>.

But the sense of the passage, as well as the parallalism of the preceding clause, favours the connection of the Authorized Version, as given above. (For a similar position of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-32 Of all judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest; of these the apostle is here speaking. The restoration of the Jews is, in the course of things, far less improbable than the call of the Gentiles to be the children of Abraham; and though others now possess these privileges, it will not hinder their being admitted again. By rejecting the gospel, and by their indignation at its being preached to the Gentiles, the Jews were become enemies to God; yet they are still to be favoured for the sake of their pious fathers. Though at present they are enemies to the gospel, for their hatred to the Gentiles; yet, when God's time is come, that will no longer exist, and God's love to their fathers will be remembered. True grace seeks not to confine God's favour. Those who find mercy themselves, should endeavour that through their mercy others also may obtain mercy. Not that the Jews will be restored to have their priesthood, and temple, and ceremonies again; an end is put to all these; but they are to be brought to believe in Christ, the true become one sheep-fold with the Gentiles, under Christ the Great Shepherd. The captivities of Israel, their dispersion, and their being shut out from the church, are emblems of the believer's corrections for doing wrong; and the continued care of the Lord towards that people, and the final mercy and blessed restoration intended for them, show the patience and love of God.</body></html>
