It is held conditionally on the tenure of faith. He ought, therefore, anxiously to guard against any failure in faith. For the moment God has turned towards him the gracious side of His providence, as towards the Jew He has turned the severe side. But this relation may easily be reversed, and the Jew received back into the favour which he once enjoyed.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">And.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">but.</span><p><span class= "bld">Among them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> among the branches of the olive-tree generally, both those which are broken off and those which are suffered to remain. This seems on the whole the more probable view; it would be possible to translate the words, <span class= "ital">in place of them</span> (the branches broken off).<p><span class= "bld">Partakest of the root and fatness</span>.--The meaning of this is sufficiently obvious as it stands. If, as perhaps is probable, we ought to drop the second "and," reading, "of the root of the fatness," the sense is that the rich flow of sap in which the wild olive par-takes does not belong to the wild olive itself, but is all drawn from the root.<p>The evidence for the omission of the second "and" is that of the Vatican, Sinaitic, and rescript Paris manuscript--a strong combination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the stock of a wild olive tree; cf. ch. Romans 11:24) <span class="cmt_word">wast grafted in among them, and wast made partaker with them of the root and the fatness of the olive tree, boast not against the branches. But if thou boastest, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee</span>. In thus addressing the Gentile in the second person singular, the apostle brings his warning home to any individual Gentile Christian who might be inclined to boast; though regarding him still as representing Gentile believers generally. They are compared to slips of the wild olive tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">oleaster</span>), which was unproductive (cf. "Infelix superat foliis oleaster amaris"), acquiring richness and fertility by being grafted into the cultivated tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">oleo</span>). Whether or not such a reversal of the usual system of grafting would have the imagined effect does not matter, as long as the illustration serves St. Paul's purpose well, and helps us to grasp, his conception. The common process is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"... to marry<br />A gentle scion to the wildest stock,<br />And make conceive a bark of baser kind,<br />By bud of nobler race."</span> In the illustration before us a scion of wildest stock is supposed to be made to conceive through the stock of nobler race to which it is united. The selecting the olive tree for illustration is happy, inasmuch as it was not only a characteristic produce of Palestine, but also regarded as symbolical of a plant of grace; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, "I am a green olive tree in the house of God;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>. See also the parable of Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8, 9</a>), where the trees apply first to the olive tree to be their king; and observe also there the word "fatness," used here also by St. Paul: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; (LXX.). The "branches" against which the ingrafted scion is warned not to boast are not exclusively either the broken-off or the remaining ones, but, as the sequel shows, the natural branches of the tree generally. The Gentile Christian is not to contemn the race of Israel because so large a portion of it is at present apart from the Church and under judgment; for it is, after all, from the stock of Israel, into which he has been engrafted, that he derives all his own fertility. As to the Christian Church being ever regarded as derived from that of Israel, the fulfilment and outcome of the ancient covenant, see note on Romans 1:2; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>, "For salvation is of the Jews." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:11-21 The gospel is the greatest riches of every place where it is. As therefore the righteous rejection of the unbelieving Jews, was the occasion of so large a multitude of the Gentiles being reconciled to God, and at peace with him; the future receiving of the Jews into the church would be such a change, as would resemble a general resurrection of the dead in sin to a life of righteousness. Abraham was as the root of the church. The Jews continued branches of this tree till, as a nation, they rejected the Messiah; after that, their relation to Abraham and to God was, as it were, cut off. The Gentiles were grafted into this tree in their room; being admitted into the church of God. Multitudes were made heirs of Abraham's faith, holiness and blessedness. It is the natural state of every one of us, to be wild by nature. Conversion is as the grafting in of wild branches into the good olive. The wild olive was often ingrafted into the fruitful one when it began to decay, and this not only brought forth fruit, but caused the decaying olive to revive and flourish. The Gentiles, of free grace, had been grafted in to share advantages. They ought therefore to beware of self-confidence, and every kind of pride or ambition; lest, having only a dead faith, and an empty profession, they should turn from God, and forfeit their privileges. If we stand at all, it is by faith; we are guilty and helpless in ourselves, and are to be humble, watchful, afraid of self-deception, or of being overcome by temptation. Not only are we at first justified by faith, but kept to the end in that justified state by faith only; yet, by a faith which is not alone, but which worketh by love to God and man.</body></html>
