It brought salvation to the Gentiles, and it did this only to react as an incentive upon the Jews.<p><span class= "bld">For to provoke them to jealousy.</span>--The reason why salvation had been extended to the Gentiles was to stir up them (the Jews) to emulation. Their privileges had made them negligent and apathetic. The sight of others stepping into those privileges was to rouse them from their apathy<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?</span> <span class="accented">i.e. in such wise as to fall</span>, rightly given in the Vulgate <span class="accented">as sic ut caderent.</span> There is no need here to press the <span class="accented">telic</span> use of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, so as to require the translation, "that they might fall." It is rather the use of <span class="accented">contemplated result.</span> God forbid. But by their fall (rather, <span class="accented">trip, or false step</span>). The word is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, suitably used here in view of the figure of stumbling. The idea is that they had stumbled over the "stumbling-block" above spoken of, but not so as to lie hopelessly prostrate. Calvin translates well, "Num impegerunt ut corruerent?" and "eoram lapsu." Alford adopts "lapse" for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. But the word, as used in English, is not equivalent. If we retain the rendering "fall," we must understand a partial or temporary fall, not prostration from which there is no recovery. <span class="cmt_word">Salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</span> (The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> with the idea conveyed by it, is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, which see.) <span class="cmt_word">Now if the fall</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, as above) <span class="cmt_word">of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness?</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, rendered in the Authorized Version "<span class="accented">diminishing"</span> and "<span class="accented">fulness</span>," have been variously understood. They are in contrast with each other, and must evidently be understood with reference to the same idea. Now, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, as used afterwards in ver. 25 <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>), seems plainly to mean the <span class="accented">full complement</span> of the Gentiles; and so here must surely be meant the <span class="accented">full complement</span> of the Jews, pointing to the same idea as as <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span> in ver. 26. If so, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> must mean the defect from such full complement - not. indeed (as some have explained), the small number (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of believers) now opposed to the full number in the future, but abstractedly, <span class="accented">defect</span>, or <span class="accented">fewness</span>, as opposed to <span class="accented">fulness.</span> This interpretation agrees with the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in the only other place where it occurs in the New Testament, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>, where it seems to signify "defect," though used in that passage with a moral reference. The reason why the present <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of the Jews is the riches of the Gentiles is that the refusal of the Jews to accept the gospel had been the occasion of its being offered to the Gentiles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-9.htm">Matthew 22:9</a>). It is not, of course, meant that the gospel was not originally intended for all the world, but only that the present and immediate promulgation of it to the Gentiles had been due to the Jews' refusal. Otherwise, we may conceive, it would have been after the fulness of the Jews had come in that it would have been extended through them to the Gentiles (el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>, where, as in other prophetic passages, the vision presented is that of the scattered <span class="accented">sons</span> of Israel being first brought into the glorified holy city, and the Gentiles gathering round them through the ever-open gates. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:11-21 The gospel is the greatest riches of every place where it is. As therefore the righteous rejection of the unbelieving Jews, was the occasion of so large a multitude of the Gentiles being reconciled to God, and at peace with him; the future receiving of the Jews into the church would be such a change, as would resemble a general resurrection of the dead in sin to a life of righteousness. Abraham was as the root of the church. The Jews continued branches of this tree till, as a nation, they rejected the Messiah; after that, their relation to Abraham and to God was, as it were, cut off. The Gentiles were grafted into this tree in their room; being admitted into the church of God. Multitudes were made heirs of Abraham's faith, holiness and blessedness. It is the natural state of every one of us, to be wild by nature. Conversion is as the grafting in of wild branches into the good olive. The wild olive was often ingrafted into the fruitful one when it began to decay, and this not only brought forth fruit, but caused the decaying olive to revive and flourish. The Gentiles, of free grace, had been grafted in to share advantages. They ought therefore to beware of self-confidence, and every kind of pride or ambition; lest, having only a dead faith, and an empty profession, they should turn from God, and forfeit their privileges. If we stand at all, it is by faith; we are guilty and helpless in ourselves, and are to be humble, watchful, afraid of self-deception, or of being overcome by temptation. Not only are we at first justified by faith, but kept to the end in that justified state by faith only; yet, by a faith which is not alone, but which worketh by love to God and man.</body></html>
