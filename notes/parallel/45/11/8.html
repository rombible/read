Etymologically, the word translated "slumber" would seem to agree better with the marginal rendering, "remorse." It comes from a root meaning to "prick or cut with a sharp instrument." There happens to be another root somewhat similar, but certainly not connected, which means "drowsiness," "slumber." Hence, where the word in the text has been used to render the Hebrew word for "slumber," it has been thought that there was a confusion between the two. It appears, however, from the LXX. usage, that the sense of "slumber" had certainly come to attach to the word here used by St. Paul. From the notion of a sharp wound or blow came to be derived that of the bewilderment or stupefaction consequent upon such a blow, and hence it came to signify stupor in general.<p>The quotation is a free combination of two passages of the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm" title="For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.">Isaiah 29:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-4.htm" title="Yet the LORD has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>), no doubt put together by the Apostle from memory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According as it is written, God gave them a spirit of slumber</span> (rather, <span class="accented">stupor.</span> The word is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, cited from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a> in the LXX.

And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompense unto them.

The references in ver. 8 are a combination of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-3.htm">Deuteronomy 29:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, quoted freely from the LXX.; that in ver. 9 is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23, 24</a>, also quoted freely. (For similar combination and free quotation of texts, so as to bring out Old Testament ideas, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32, 33</a>.) It is not necessary that the passages here referred to should be regarded as directly prophetic of the time of Christ. It is enough for the purpose of the argument that God's people should be shown to be liable to the state of stupefaction described, without ceasing to be his people. And so the thought, which has been in view all along, is now taken up, of the present hardening of Israel as a nation not being intended to be permanent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-10 There was a chosen remnant of believing Jews, who had righteousness and life by faith in Jesus Christ. These were kept according to the election of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not be of works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition in a fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause, of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to the last must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directly contrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. God glorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of the rebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewish nation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, or concern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or of their being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews, foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of David against his enemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressions of his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyes darkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.</body></html>
