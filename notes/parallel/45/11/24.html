St. Paul announces it as a "mystery," which his readers may be ignorant of, but which he wishes them to know. By the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as used by St. Paul, is meant something hidden from man in the Divine counsels till made known by revelation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; and, in this Epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a> - a passage which expresses clearly the apostle's meaning in his use of the word). In the LXX. it denotes any Divine secret, which may or may not be made known to man (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18, 19</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-6.htm">Job 11:6</a>; Wisd. 2:22; Ecclus. 22:22 Ecclus. 27:16). So also in the Gospels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>) it is said to be given to the disciples to know the <span class="accented">mysteries</span> of the kingdom of heaven, but to others in parables. In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> were Divine secrets (as in the Eleusinian Mysteries) which were revealed to the initiated alone. St. Paul uses the word with the same essential meaning; only he speaks of <span class="accented">mysteries</span> which had already been revealed to himself and others by the Spirit, and has ever in view the Divine purposes, previously unknown, for the salvation of mankind. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; and Ephesians 3:3, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, he speaks of the Divine purpose to "gather in one all things in Christ," and that "the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs," etc., as a <span class="accented">mystery</span>, "not made known in other ages unto the sons of men," but now revealed to the "holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit." (The other passages in which St. Paul uses the word are <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>.) Here he announces the Divine purpose to save "all Israel" at last through the calling of the Gentiles as a <span class="accented">mystery</span> which has been revealed to himself and others, and which he desires the Gentile Christians to be aware of, lest they should be "wise in their own conceits," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> presume on their present position of privilege through ignorance of what is in store for Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-32 Of all judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest; of these the apostle is here speaking. The restoration of the Jews is, in the course of things, far less improbable than the call of the Gentiles to be the children of Abraham; and though others now possess these privileges, it will not hinder their being admitted again. By rejecting the gospel, and by their indignation at its being preached to the Gentiles, the Jews were become enemies to God; yet they are still to be favoured for the sake of their pious fathers. Though at present they are enemies to the gospel, for their hatred to the Gentiles; yet, when God's time is come, that will no longer exist, and God's love to their fathers will be remembered. True grace seeks not to confine God's favour. Those who find mercy themselves, should endeavour that through their mercy others also may obtain mercy. Not that the Jews will be restored to have their priesthood, and temple, and ceremonies again; an end is put to all these; but they are to be brought to believe in Christ, the true become one sheep-fold with the Gentiles, under Christ the Great Shepherd. The captivities of Israel, their dispersion, and their being shut out from the church, are emblems of the believer's corrections for doing wrong; and the continued care of the Lord towards that people, and the final mercy and blessed restoration intended for them, show the patience and love of God.</body></html>
