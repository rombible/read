This is the construction adopted in the Authorised version, and is expressed by the use of the word "both." Or all three substantives may be independent, <span class= "ital">O</span> <span class= "ital">the depth of the riches, and of the wisdom and knowledge of God!</span> In either case, "riches" means "inexhaustible resources," implying either that the wisdom and knowledge of God are inexhaustible, or that the materials at their command are inexhaustible. By means of these infinite resources God is able to bring good even out of evil.<p><span class= "bld">Judgments.</span>--<span class= "ital">Decisions,</span> such as that by which Israel was excluded and the Gentiles admitted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge</span> (or, <span class="accented">of the riches and wisdom and knowledge</span>) of God!

(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-10.htm">Job 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13</a>, quoted accurately from the LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-11.htm">Job 41:11</a>, where the Hebrew has (Revised Version), "Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?" The LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm">Job 41:2</a>) gives an entirely different sense of the passage; and it would thus appear, as may be seen also in other cases, that St. Paul, though usually quoting more or less freely from the LXX., was familiar also with the Hebrew text, and exercised judgment in his citations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:33-36 The apostle Paul knew the mysteries of the kingdom of God as well as ever any man; yet he confesses himself at a loss; and despairing to find the bottom, he humbly sits down at the brink, and adores the depth. Those who know most in this imperfect state, feel their own weakness most. There is not only depth in the Divine counsels, but riches; abundance of that which is precious and valuable. The Divine counsels are complete; they have not only depth and height, but breadth and length, Eph 3:18, and that passing knowledge. There is that vast distance and disproportion between God and man, between the Creator and the creature, which for ever shuts us from knowledge of his ways. What man shall teach God how to govern the world? The apostle adores the sovereignty of the Divine counsels. All things in heaven and earth, especially those which relate to our salvation, that belong to our peace, are all of him by way of creation, through him by way of providence, that they may be to him in their end. Of God, as the Spring and Fountain of all; through Christ, to God, as the end. These include all God's relations to his creatures; if all are of Him, and through Him, all should be to Him, and for Him. Whatever begins, let God's glory be the end: especially let us adore him when we talk of the Divine counsels and actings. The saints in heaven never dispute, but always praise.</body></html>
