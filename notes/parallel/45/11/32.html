It will lead to a happy and complete reunion, "one flock under one shepherd."<p><span class= "bld">For God hath concluded them all in unbelief.</span>--A weighty sentence embracing the whole course of human history, and summing up the divine philosophy of the whole matter. We might almost take these profound words of St. Paul as a motto for the theological side of the theory of evolution. Severe and rigorous as that doctrine may seem, its goal is <span class= "ital">perfection,</span> the absolute harmony of all things working in accordance with the divine will. And if an objection is taken on the ground of the waste of individual life, this may be subject to we know not what beneficent rectifications in a sphere removed from that of the senses. We are able to see only a "part of God's ways," and the drift and tendency of visible things makes it not difficult for us to believe that "all things work together for good," even where the process by which they do so is not to be traced by the human eye.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God hath concluded them all in</span> (literally, <span class="accented">shut them all up into</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unbelief</span> (or, <span class="accented">disobedience</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>that he might have mercy upon them all</span>. Chrysostom and other Greek Fathers understood <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> mean only <span class="accented">declared them to be</span> unbelieving (or, <span class="accented">disobedient</span>), or <span class="accented">convicted</span> them of being so. Thus Chrysostom, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. So, it may be said, must the verb he understood where St. Paul elsewhere uses it with a similar reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-22.htm">Galatians 3:22</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;</span> being there the nominative to the verb. But <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> being the nominative here, the more obvious meaning seems to be that the shutting up was God's doing. Some, understanding it so, would soften the expression by explaining that God allowed them to become so shut up. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (Diodorus), But we need not shrink from the plain meaning of the expression, viz. that it was God's own act. He is not thus represented as plunging men into inevitable infidelity, having given them no choice. As in the case of the <span class="accented">hardening</span> spoken of' above, his dealings are <span class="accented">judicial</span>; the state into which. they are now by him shut up has not been undeserved. And, further, his ultimate purpose is here distinctly declared to be one of mercy. The way in which the apostle regards such present judicial dealing as conducive to final mercy appears to be such as this. It is the doctrine of the whole Epistle that salvation is to be attained by man's renouncing his own imagined righteousness, and submitting himself to the righteousness of God. It conduces to this end that his <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> should have its course and consequences; so that, conscience being at length awakened, he may long for deliverance from his hopeless state, and appreciate the offered salvation (see ch. 7.). So the Gentile world was long shut up in its self-induced, but also judicial, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>); that, "the wrath of God" being at length revealed to it from heaven, the "righteousness of God" might also be revealed to it and laid hold cf. In like manner God deals now with the Jews, who still persist in going about to establish their own righteousness instead of submitting themselves to the righteousness of God. He shuts them up for the present in their <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, to the end that at length, after their long judgment, and stirred up by the fulness of the Gentiles coming in, they may feel their need, and accept salvation. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the concluding clause seems to mean generally all mankind, Jews as well as Gentiles; and <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> (as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> was understood above with respect to "all Israel," as suggested by the context and the general drift of the chapter) God's embracing all races of mankind at last in the arms of his mercy by calling them into the Church. Thus the latter expression is not in itself adducible in support of the doctrine of universalism. Certainly the prospect of a universal triumph of the gospel before the end rises here before the apostle in prophetic vision; and it may be that it carries with it to his mind further glories of eternal salvation for all, casting their rays backward over all past ages, so as to inspire an unbounded hope. Such a hope, which seems elsewhere intimated (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10, 20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, would justify the glowing rhapsody of admiration and thanksgiving that follows more fully than if we supposed the apostle to contemplate still the eternal perdition of the multitudes who in all the ages have not on earth found mercy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:22-32 Of all judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest; of these the apostle is here speaking. The restoration of the Jews is, in the course of things, far less improbable than the call of the Gentiles to be the children of Abraham; and though others now possess these privileges, it will not hinder their being admitted again. By rejecting the gospel, and by their indignation at its being preached to the Gentiles, the Jews were become enemies to God; yet they are still to be favoured for the sake of their pious fathers. Though at present they are enemies to the gospel, for their hatred to the Gentiles; yet, when God's time is come, that will no longer exist, and God's love to their fathers will be remembered. True grace seeks not to confine God's favour. Those who find mercy themselves, should endeavour that through their mercy others also may obtain mercy. Not that the Jews will be restored to have their priesthood, and temple, and ceremonies again; an end is put to all these; but they are to be brought to believe in Christ, the true become one sheep-fold with the Gentiles, under Christ the Great Shepherd. The captivities of Israel, their dispersion, and their being shut out from the church, are emblems of the believer's corrections for doing wrong; and the continued care of the Lord towards that people, and the final mercy and blessed restoration intended for them, show the patience and love of God.</body></html>
