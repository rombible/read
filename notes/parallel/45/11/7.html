The corresponding words in the Gospels are rightly translated. The term is one used in medicine for the forming of chalkstone, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then?</span> (What is the present state of things?) <span class="cmt_word">That which Israel seeketh for</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-30.htm">Romans 9:30, 31</a><span class="cmt_word">) he hath not obtained; but the election</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the elect of the Gentiles, with a remnant only of the Jews - <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> being abstr, pro concret., like <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, elsewhere) <span class="cmt_word">hath obtained it, and the rest were hardened</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The verb denotes callousness rather than blindness, usually in the New Testament referring to the <span class="accented">heart</span> (cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). And such hardening is no new and strange thing, or to be taken as implying failure of God's promises to his people; for it is but what Scripture tells us of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-10 There was a chosen remnant of believing Jews, who had righteousness and life by faith in Jesus Christ. These were kept according to the election of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not be of works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition in a fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause, of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to the last must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directly contrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. God glorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of the rebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewish nation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, or concern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or of their being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews, foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of David against his enemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressions of his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyes darkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.</body></html>
