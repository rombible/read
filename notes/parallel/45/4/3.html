Abraham was not justified by works, and therefore had nothing to boast of in God's sight. He was justified by faith. His righteousness was not real, but imputed. His faith was treated as if it had been equivalent to a righteousness of works. It met with the same acceptance in the sight of God that a righteousness of works would have done. But--the argument goes on--faith carries with it no such idea of merit or debt as works. It is met by a pure act of grace on the part of God.<p><span class= "bld">Abraham believed God.</span>--The quotation is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a>, where it appears as a comment upon Abraham's belief in the promise that he should have a numerous posterity. The same passage is elaborately commented upon by Philo and others, so that it would seem to have been a common topic in the Jewish schools. It should be noticed that the word "faith" is not used in quite the same sense in the original and in the application. In Abraham's case it was trust in the fulfilment of the divine promise, in St. Paul's sense it is rather enthusiastic adhesion to a person. This is part of the general enlargement and deepening of the Old Testament terminology by St. Paul. A writer of less profundity (though marked by striking and elevated qualities), the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, applies the word more strictly. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-8.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.">Hebrews 11:8</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">James 2:23</a> the word has the still thinner meaning of a merely intellectual assent. St Paul quotes the same passage in the same sense as here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus B: On the Meaning of the word Faith.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">It was counted unto him.</span>--It should be observed that the same words are translated by the Authorised version here, "it was <span class= "ital">counted unto</span> him;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9</a>, "faith was <span class= "ital">reckoned to</span> Abraham;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-22.htm" title="And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.">Romans 4:22</a>, "it was <span class= "ital">imputed unto</span> him;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>, "it was <span class= "ital">accounted to</span> him;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">James 2:23</a>, "it was <span class= "ital">imputed to</span> him." A defect in the translation, which, however, hardly obscures the true meaning.<p>The sense of imputation is not to be got rid of. It is distinctly a forensic act. The righteousness attributed to Abraham is not an actual righteousness, but something else that is considered and treated as if it were equivalent to such righteousness. It is so treated by God acting as the judge of men. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus E: On the Doctrine of Justification by Faith and Imputed Righteousness.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned Unto him for righteousness.</span> This notable text (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>), declaring the ground of Abraham's acceptance, is similarly quoted in the cognate passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6</a>. It has a peculiar cogency in the general argument from being in connection with, and with reference to, one of the Divine promises to Abraham of an unnumbered seed; so that it may be understood with an extended application to those who were to inherit the blessing, as well as to the "father of the faithful," and so declaring the principle of justification for all the "children of the promise." Further, it would be peculiarly telling as addressed to the Jews, who made such a point of their descent from Abraham as the root of all their position of privilege (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-6.htm">Psalm 105:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>). The two significant expressions in it are <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> (denoting faith, not works) and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> The whole phrase, the apostle proceeds to say, implies that the reward spoken of was not earned, but granted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 To meet the views of the Jews, the apostle first refers to the example of Abraham, in whom the Jews gloried as their most renowned forefather. However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in the presence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others. Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and the failures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it was expressly stated in Scripture that he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, Ge 15:6. From this example it is observed, that if any man could work the full measure required by the law, the reward must be reckoned as a debt, which evidently was not the case even of Abraham, seeing faith was reckoned to him for righteousness. When believers are justified by faith, their faith being counted for righteousness, their faith does not justify them as a part, small or great, of their righteousness; but as the appointed means of uniting them to Him who has chosen as the name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness. Pardoned people are the only blessed people. It clearly appears from the Scripture, that Abraham was justified several years before his circumcision. It is, therefore, plain that this rite was not necessary in order to justification. It was a sign of the original corruption of human nature. And it was such a sign as was also an outward seal, appointed not only to confirm God's promises to him and to his seed, and their obligation to be the Lord's, but likewise to assure him of his being already a real partaker of the righteousness of faith. Thus Abraham was the spiritual forefather of all believers, who walked after the example of his obedient faith. The seal of the Holy Spirit in our sanctification, making us new creatures, is the inward evidence of the righteousness of faith.</body></html>
