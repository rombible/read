The atoning efficacy lay in His death, but the proof of that efficacy--the proof that it was really the Messiah who died--was to be seen in the Resurrection. The Resurrection, therefore, gave the greatest impulse to faith in the atoning efficacy of the death upon the cross, and in this way helped to bring about justification. Comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm" title="And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.">1Corinthians 15:17</a>, "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> you have no guarantee that your sins have really been remitted; if the death of Christ had not been followed by His resurrection, the inference would have followed that it was merely the death of an ordinary man, and without any special saving efficacy.<p>The distinction should be carefully observed between the bearing of these two acts, the death and the resurrection of Christ, on the doctrines of justification and sanctification respectively. For the latter see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm" title="God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?">Romans 6:2</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span><p>In looking back over the argument of this fourth chapter, we feel that it is a keen and subtle <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem,</span> addressed to Jews, and based upon their own method of interpretation. Its permanent value is derived from its bearing upon the theological system of St. Paul himself--the doctrines of faith, grace, no boasting, the supreme disposing power of God, the saving efficacy of the death of Christ.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:23-25 The history of Abraham, and of his justification, was recorded to teach men of after-ages; those especially to whom the gospel was then made known. It is plain, that we are not justified by the merit of our own works, but by faith in Jesus Christ and his righteousness; which is the truth urged in this and the foregoing chapter, as the great spring and foundation of all comfort. Christ did meritoriously work our justification and salvation by his death and passion, but the power and perfection thereof, with respect to us, depend on his resurrection. By his death he paid our debt, in his resurrection he received our acquittance, Isa 53:8. When he was discharged, we, in Him and together with Him, received the discharge from the guilt and punishment of all our sins. This last verse is an abridgement or summary of the whole gospel.</body></html>
