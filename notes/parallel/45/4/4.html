It therefore carries with it no ground of boasting.<p>The proposition is put in a general form. Those who base their claim on works have a right to their reward. It is not conceded to them by any sort of imputation, but is their <span class= "ital">desert.</span> On the other hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-5.htm" title="But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.">Romans 4:5</a>), those who rely only upon faith, even though ungodly themselves, have righteousness imputed to them. This latter was Abraham's case, and not the former. (The specific application to Abraham is not expressed, but implied.)<p><span class= "bld">The reward.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">his wages.</span> The relation between what he receives and what he does is that of wages for work done. He can claim it, if need be, in a court of law. There is in it no element of grace, or favour, or concession.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt</span> (literally, <span class="accented">according to grace, but according to the debt, i.e.</span> according to what is due). <span class="cmt_word">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness</span>. The expression, "him that worketh" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), evidently means him that works with a view to a reward which he can claim; or, as Luther explains it, "one who deals in works;" or, as we might say with the same signification, "the worker." (For a like use of the present participle, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>.) So also in ver. 5, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> means one who does <span class="accented">not</span> so work. Thus there is here no denial of the necessity of good works. <span class="accented">It is the principle only of justification</span> that is in view. "Neque enim fideles vult esse ignavos; sed tantum mercenarias esse vetat, qui a Deo quicquam reposcant quasi jure debitum" (Calvin). One view of the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> is that it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>, being meant as an illustration, thus: The workman's wage is due to him, and not granted as a favour (so Afford). But this notion does not suit the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> in the following verse. The strong word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;</span> ("ungodly") is not to be understood as designating Abraham himself, the proposition being a general one. Nor does it imply that continued <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> is consistent with justification; only that even the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> are justified through faith on their repentance and amendment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 To meet the views of the Jews, the apostle first refers to the example of Abraham, in whom the Jews gloried as their most renowned forefather. However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in the presence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others. Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and the failures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it was expressly stated in Scripture that he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, Ge 15:6. From this example it is observed, that if any man could work the full measure required by the law, the reward must be reckoned as a debt, which evidently was not the case even of Abraham, seeing faith was reckoned to him for righteousness. When believers are justified by faith, their faith being counted for righteousness, their faith does not justify them as a part, small or great, of their righteousness; but as the appointed means of uniting them to Him who has chosen as the name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness. Pardoned people are the only blessed people. It clearly appears from the Scripture, that Abraham was justified several years before his circumcision. It is, therefore, plain that this rite was not necessary in order to justification. It was a sign of the original corruption of human nature. And it was such a sign as was also an outward seal, appointed not only to confirm God's promises to him and to his seed, and their obligation to be the Lord's, but likewise to assure him of his being already a real partaker of the righteousness of faith. Thus Abraham was the spiritual forefather of all believers, who walked after the example of his obedient faith. The seal of the Holy Spirit in our sanctification, making us new creatures, is the inward evidence of the righteousness of faith.</body></html>
