Three stages are indicated: (1) faith, (2) imputed righteousness, (3) access to the Messianic kingdom with all its privileges.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For not through law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith, For if they which are of law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect. For the Law worketh wrath: for where no law is, neither is there transgression</span>. The point of the argument is that the principle of law is essentially different from that on which Abraham was justified, and which is hence to be understood in the fulfilment of the promise to him and his seed. How this is so is shortly intimated in ver. 15, the idea being more fully expounded in ch. 7. The idea is (as has been already explained) that law simply <span class="accented">declares</span> what is right, and <span class="accented">requires</span> conformity to it; it does not give either <span class="accented">power</span> to obey, or <span class="accented">atonement</span> for not obeying. Hence, in itself, it worketh, not righteousness, but <span class="accented">wrath</span>; for man becomes fully liable to wrath when he comes to know, through law, the difference between right and wrong (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>, "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin"). Exactly the same view of the impossibility of the Mosaic Law being the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3.htm">Galatians 3</a>, where also the real purpose of the Law, intervening thus between the promise and its fulfilment, is further explained. The expression in ver. 13, "that he should be the heir of the world," has reference to the ultimate scope of the Abrahamic promises (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5, 6, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>). Now, it is true that in some of these promises the language used seems to denote no more than the temporal possession by Israel of the promised land, with dominion (actually realized under David and Solomon) over the whole country from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, etc. But their full scope transcends any such limited fulfilment, as where it is said that the promised seed should be as the stars of heaven, and as the dust of the earth that cannot be numbered, and that in it all the nations of the earth should be blessed. The prophets accordingly recognized a far larger ultimate fulfilment in their frequent pictures of the Messiah's universal dominion; and there was no need for the apostle to prove here what the Jews already understood. The only difference between the view current among them and his would be that they would mostly have in view a universal worldly sovereignty with its local centre on the throne of David at Jerusalem, while he interpreted spirttually, seeing beyond the outward framework of prophetic visions to the ideal they imply. "<span class="accented">Heres mundi</span> idem est quod <span class="accented">pater omnium gentium</span>, benedictionem accipientium. Totus <span class="accented">mundus</span> promissus est Abrahae et semini ejus per totum mundum conjunctim. Abrahamo obtigit terra Canaan, et sic aliis alia pars; atque <span class="accented">corporalia sunt specimen spiritualium.</span> Christus beres mundi, et omuium (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>), et qui in eum credunt Abrahae exemplo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>) (Bengel). It is to be observed that, though Abraham himself in ver. 13 is spoken of as "the heir of the world," yet the preceding expression, "to Abrabam or to his seed," sufficiently intimates that it is in his seed, identified with him, that he is conceived as so inheriting. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-22 The promise was made to Abraham long before the law. It points at Christ, and it refers to the promise, Ge 12:3. In Thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. The law worketh wrath, by showing that every transgressor is exposed to the Divine displeasure. As God intended to give men a title to the promised blessings, so he appointed it to be by faith, that it might be wholly of grace, to make it sure to all who were of the like precious faith with Abraham, whether Jews or Gentiles, in all ages. The justification and salvation of sinners, the taking to himself the Gentiles who had not been a people, were a gracious calling of things which are not, as though they were; and this giving a being to things that were not, proves the almighty power of God. The nature and power of Abraham's faith are shown. He believed God's testimony, and looked for the performance of his promise, firmly hoping when the case seemed hopeless. It is weakness of faith, that makes a man lie poring on the difficulties in the way of a promise. Abraham took it not for a point that would admit of argument or debate. Unbelief is at the bottom of all our staggerings at God's promises. The strength of faith appeared in its victory over fears. God honours faith; and great faith honours God. It was imputed to him for righteousness. Faith is a grace that of all others gives glory to God. Faith clearly is the instrument by which we receive the righteousness of God, the redemption which is by Christ; and that which is the instrument whereby we take or receive it, cannot be the thing itself, nor can it be the gift thereby taken and received. Abraham's faith did not justify him by its own merit or value, but as giving him a part in Christ.</body></html>
