Following out this the Apostle shows how even Abraham's case tells, not against, but for the doctrine of justification by faith. Indeed, Abraham himself came under it. And not only so, but those who act upon this doctrine are spiritually descendants of Abraham. It is entirely a mistake to suppose that they of the circumcision only are Abraham's seed. The true seed of Abraham are those who follow his example of faith. He put faith in the promise, they must put their faith in the fulfilment of the promise.<p>(1) To come back to the question of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?">Romans 3:1</a>, repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;">Romans 3:9</a>, in what did the superiority of Abraham, the great representative of the Jewish race, really consist?<p><span class= "bld">As pertaining to the flesh.</span>--The construction of these words appears to be determined by their position in the sentence. According to the best MSS. they are distinctly separated from "hath found" and joined with "our father." They would therefore mean simply "our father according to the flesh," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by natural descent, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Hath found.</span>--<span class= "ital">Hath got,</span> or <span class= "ital">gained,</span> by way of advantage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-25.</span> - (5) <span class="accented">Abraham himself shown to have been justified by faith, and not by works, believers being his true heirs.</span> The main points of the argument may be summarized thus: When Abraham obtained a blessing to himself and to his seed for ever, it was by faith, and not by works, that he is declared to have been justified so as to obtain it. Thus the promise to his seed, as well as to himself, rested on the principle of justification by faith only. The Law, of which the principle was essentially different, could not, and did not, in itself fulfil that promise; and that its fulfilment was not dependent on circumcision, or confined to the circumcised, is further shown by the fact that it was before his own circumcision that he received the blessing and the promise, Hence the seed intended in the promise was his spiritual seed, who are of faith such as his was; and in Christ, offering justification through faith to all, the promise is now fulfilled. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then shall we say that Abraham our father according to the flesh hath found?</span> The connection, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, with the preceding argument is rather with vers. 27, 28 of ch. 3, than with its concluding words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This appears, not only from the drift of ch. 4, but also from the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 2, connecting the thought with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>. The line of thought is, in the first place, this: We have said that all human glorying is shut out, and that no man can be justified except by faith: how, then (it is important to inquire), was it with Abraham our great progenitor? Did not he at least earn the blessing to his seed by the merit of his works? Had not he, on that ground, whereof to glory? No, not even he. Scripture, in what it says of him, distinctly asserts the contrary. There is uncertainty in this verse as to whether "according to the flesh" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) is to be connected with "our father" or with "hath found." Readings vary in their arrangement of the words. The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. But the great preponderance of authority is in favour of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. The first of these readings requires the connection of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; the second allows it, but suggests the other connection. Theodoret, among the ancients, connecting with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, explains <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> thus: "What righteousness, of Abraham's, wrought <span class="accented">before he believed God</span>, did we ever hear of?" Calvin suggests, as the meaning of the phrase (though himself inclining to the connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," naturaliter vel ex seipso." Bull, similarly ('Harmonic Apostolica,' 'Disputatio Posterior,' c. 12:14-17), "by his natural powers, without the grace of God." Alford, following Meyer, says that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> is in contrast to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that it "refers to that department of our being from which spring works, in contrast with that in which is the exercise of faith." Difficulty is avoided if (as is the most natural inference from the best authenticated reading) we take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense of our forefather in the way of natural descent, the question being put from the Jewish standpoint; and this in distinction from the other conception of descent from Abraham, according to which all the faithful are called his children (cl. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3, 5, 8</a>:<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>).

However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in the presence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others. Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and the failures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it was expressly stated in Scripture that he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, Ge 15:6. From this example it is observed, that if any man could work the full measure required by the law, the reward must be reckoned as a debt, which evidently was not the case even of Abraham, seeing faith was reckoned to him for righteousness. When believers are justified by faith, their faith being counted for righteousness, their faith does not justify them as a part, small or great, of their righteousness; but as the appointed means of uniting them to Him who has chosen as the name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness. Pardoned people are the only blessed people. It clearly appears from the Scripture, that Abraham was justified several years before his circumcision. It is, therefore, plain that this rite was not necessary in order to justification. It was a sign of the original corruption of human nature. And it was such a sign as was also an outward seal, appointed not only to confirm God's promises to him and to his seed, and their obligation to be the Lord's, but likewise to assure him of his being already a real partaker of the righteousness of faith. Thus Abraham was the spiritual forefather of all believers, who walked after the example of his obedient faith. The seal of the Holy Spirit in our sanctification, making us new creatures, is the inward evidence of the righteousness of faith.</body></html>
