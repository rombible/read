Now he returns to the topic, and in order to complete his historical view of the origin of sin through Adam, and its atonement through Christ, he considers what was its effect upon the former, and how that effect was met and neutralised by the latter. Mankind had already been led into sin by Adam. The Law came in to make matters still worse. It substituted conscious sin for unconscious, and so heightened its guilt. But all this is more than retrieved by grace.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">Entered.</span>--A graphic metaphorical expression: "Came in to the side of" the sin already existing; "took its place," as it were, "by the side of" sin, and joined forces with it, thus greatly adding to its extent and power.<p><span class= "bld">Abound.</span>--This word should be reserved for the last of the three places in this verse in which it appears in the Authorised version.

Here <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (though without the article; see under ver. 13) refers to the Mosaic Law, the purpose of which in the economy of redemption is thus intimated, so as to complete the view. It was God's purpose from the first that grace should in the end triumph over sin; but in the mean time law came in (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> in the cognate passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). For what end? Not in itself to accomplish the purpose, not to interfere with its accomplishment, but as an intervening dispensation to prepare for its accomplishment, by convincing of sin, and making it exceeding sinful, and so establishing the need of, and exciting a craving for, redemption. This intervening preparatory office of the Mosaic Law is set forth more at length in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19-26</a>; and the working of the principle of law to this end in the human consciousness is analyzed in ch. 7. of this Epistle. <span class="accented">Additional Note on ver.</span>12The significance of the words "life" and "death," as used in St. Paul's Epistles and elsewhere, demands peculiar attention. They evidently bear a sense in many places different from that of ordinary use; and this in accordance with our Lord's own recorded language, as, for instance, in his memorable words to Martha, given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>. The following considerations may aid our comprehension of what is meant. The mysterious principle or potency of life, even in the common acceptation of the term, varies not only in degree, but in kind; and the same living organism may be at the same time alive with respect to its own mode of vitality, and dead with respect to some higher one which vivifies others. The plant, while alive with respect to its own kind of life, is dead to the higher life of sentient beings. The brute beast, while alive with respect to mere animal life, is dead, as it were, to the higher life of intelligent man. A whole world of environing influences to which the mind of man responds, so as to live in them, are to the brute as nothing; it may be said to be dead to them. Now, Scripture teaches, and we believe, that there is a spiritual sphere of things above and beyond this visible sphere, which man is capable of apprehending, being influenced by, and living a still higher life than his natural life therein. He is thus capable through the higher and diviner part of his mysterious being, called by St. Paul his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), when in touch with the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. For man to be in vital correspondence with his spiritual environments is spiritual life; to be out of correspondence with them is spiritual death. And so, as the plant is dead to sentient life, though alive in its own life; or as the brute may be said to be dead to the higher life of man, though alive in mere animal life; so man may be dead as to <span class="accented">spiritual</span> life, though alive as to <span class="accented">psychical</span> life; and thus "dead while he liveth" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, "The natural man (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." In other words, he is dead to them). Further, this spiritual life, unlike the psychical life, is ever spoken of as <span class="accented">eternal.</span> For it consists in intercommunion of man's immortal part with the spiritual sphere of things which is eternal. Nor does natural death interrupt it; for it is not dependent for its continuance, as is psychical life, on environments from which we are severed by the body's death, but on such as are eternal. Thus, too, we see how it is that eternal life is regarded, not as one that will have its commencement after death, but as one to be enjoyed at present, and to which we are to rise in Christ even now. This idea is notably expressed in our Lord's words above referred to: "I am the Resurrection, and the Life: he that believeth in me, though he die, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). Doubtless we are bidden to look forward to a fulness and perfection of the eternal life, of which our present enjoyment of it is but an earnest, in the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>) in store for us hereafter - cf. "Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet manifested what we shall be," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>) - but still this is regarded as but the consummation of a life already begun. On the other hand, whatever penal consequences of a state of spiritual death may be spoken of as in store hereafter for the wicked, it is regarded as being itself but the continuance of a state of death in which they are before they pass away (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, etc., to which this note refers, the above view of what is often meant by "death" ought to be kept before us. For, though the apostle seems evidently to be speaking of the natural death that comes to all, he must be taken as regarding it as but the symbol and evidence of the sway of that spiritual death to which all men are now, in their fallen nature, liable. The thoughts embodied in the above note have been derived from, or suggested by, 'Natural Law in the Spiritual World,' by Henry Drummond, F.R.S.E., F.G.S. (Hodder and Stoughton: 1888). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:20,21 By Christ and his righteousness, we have more and greater privileges than we lost by the offence of Adam. The moral law showed that many thoughts, tempers, words, and actions, were sinful, thus transgressions were multiplied. Not making sin to abound the more, but discovering the sinfulness of it, even as the letting in a clearer light into a room, discovers the dust and filth which were there before, but were not seen. The sin of Adam, and the effect of corruption in us, are the abounding of that offence which appeared on the entrance of the law. And the terrors of the law make gospel comforts the more sweet. Thus God the Holy Spirit has, by the blessed apostle, delivered to us a most important truth, full of consolation, suited to our need as sinners. Whatever one may have above another, every man is a sinner against God, stands condemned by the law, and needs pardon. A righteousness that is to justify cannot be made up of a mixture of sin and holiness. There can be no title to an eternal reward without a pure and spotless righteousness: let us look for it, even to the righteousness of Christ.</body></html>
