The obedience of Christ was an element in the atonement. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Philippians 2:8</a>, where it is said that he "became obedient unto death;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.">Hebrews 10:7</a>, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God," specially in connection with the atonement.) But if we interpret St. Paul by himself, we must not see in it the sole element to the exclusion of the "propitiatory sacrifice" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the One shall the many be made righteous.</span> As to the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, see under ver. 15. The phrase, if taken as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, would seem here to imply even more than in ver. 15; for there it was only said that "the gift... abounded unto the many;" here an actual result is expressed by the future, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. But even so the universality of final salvation need not necessarily follow. The phrase is, "shall be constituted righteous," and might only mean that all will be put into the position of justified persons, capable as such of salvation, just as all had, through the first transgression, been put into the position of sinners, liable as such to condemnation; and the future tense might be taken to denote the continuance, through all future ages, of the availing effect of the accomplished atonement. Further, it may be remarked that if universal final salvation did seem to follow from the passage before us, it would still have to be understood consistently with the purport of ch. 6, 7, and 8, which follow. In them the practical result to the believer of his justification through Christ is treated; and renunciation of sin, "living after the Spirit," is postulated as the condition for attaining the life eternal. Hence, if the doctrine of "eternal hope" be sound (and who can fail to desire that it should be so?), it must be to some unknown reconciliation beyond the limits of the present life that we must look in the case of those who have not fulfilled the necessary conditions here. Thus, further, the doctrine cannot legitimately be allowed to affect our view of our responsibilities now. To us the only doctrine distinctly revealed on the subject of salvation is that it is in this present life that we are to make our "calling and election sure." Two ways are put before us - the way of life, and the way of death; the one leading to <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the other to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. In vers. 6-10 (as elsewhere, see note on Romans 3:25) it was through the <span class="accented">death</span>, the <span class="accented">blood</span>, of Christ that we were said to have been reconciled to God; here it is through his <span class="accented">obedience</span>, opposed to the <span class="accented">disobedience</span> of Adam. Though the doctrine of the atonement, in all its depth, is beyond our comprehension now (see above on ver. 9), yet it is important for us to observe the various aspects in which it is presented to us in Scripture. Here the idea suggested is that of Christ, as the Representative of humanity, satisfying Divine righteousness by perfect <span class="accented">obedience</span> to the Divine will, and thus offering to God for man what man had lest the power of offering (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>, "Lo, I come to fulfil thy will, O my God;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-9.htm">Hebrews 10:9</a>, <span class="accented">et seq</span>.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, "became <span class="accented">obedient</span> unto death, even the death of the cross"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-19 Through one man's offence, all mankind are exposed to eternal condemnation. But the grace and mercy of God, and the free gift of righteousness and salvation, are through Jesus Christ, as man: yet the Lord from heaven has brought the multitude of believers into a more safe and exalted state than that from which they fell in Adam. This free gift did not place them anew in a state of trial, but fixed them in a state of justification, as Adam would have been placed, had he stood. Notwithstanding the differences, there is a striking similarity. As by the offence of one, sin and death prevailed to the condemnation of all men, so by the righteousness of one, grace prevailed to the justification of all related to Christ by faith. Through the grace of God, the gift by grace has abounded to many through Christ; yet multitudes choose to remain under the dominion of sin and death, rather than to apply for the blessings of the reign of grace. But Christ will in nowise cast out any who are willing to come to him.</body></html>
