Faith brings justification; justification brings (let us see that it <span class= "ital">does</span> bring) peace--peace with God, through the mediation of Jesus. To that mediation it is that the Christian owes his state of grace or acceptance in the present, and his triumphant hope of glory in the future. Nay, the triumph begins now. It begins even with tribulation, for tribulation leads by gradual stages to that tried and approved constancy which is a virtue most nearly allied to hope. Such hope does not deceive. It is grounded upon the consciousness of justifying love assured to us by the wonderful sacrifice of the death of Christ. The one great and difficult step was that which reconciled sinful man to God; the completion of the process of his salvation follows by easy sequence. Knowing this our consciousness just spoken of takes a glow of triumph.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Being justified.</span>--The present chapter is thus linked on to the last. Christ was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification. "Being <span class= "ital">justified</span> then," &c. This opening has a wonderful beauty which centres in the Christian idea of peace. After all the gloomy retrospect which fills the preceding chapters, the clouds break, and light steals gently over the scene. Nor is it merely the subsidence of storm, but an ardent and eager hope that now awakens, and looks forward to a glorious future.<p><span class= "bld">We have.</span>--A decided preponderance of MSS. authority compels us to read here, "Let us have," though the older reading would seem to make the best sense. A hortatory element is introduced into the passage, which does not seem quite properly or naturally to belong to it. It is just possible that there may have been a very early error of the copyist, afterwards rightly corrected (in the two oldest MSS., Vat. and Sin., the reading of the Authorised version appears as a correction) by conjecture. On the other hand, it is too much always to assume that a writer really used the expression which it seems to us most natural that he should have used. "Let us have" would mean "Let us enter into and possess."<p><span class= "bld">Peace.</span>--The state of reconciliation with God, with all that blissful sense of composure and harmony which flows from such a condition. "Peace" is the special legacy bequeathed by Jesus to His disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm" title="These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.">John 16:33</a>); it is also the word used, with deep significance, after miracles of healing, attended with forgiveness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-34.htm" title="And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.">Mark 5:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-50.htm" title="And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.">Luke 7:50</a>). Boswell notes a remark of Johnson's upon this word. "He repeated to Mr. Langton, with great energy in the Greek, our Saviour's gracious expression concerning the forgiveness of Mary Magdalene: 'Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-50.htm" title="And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.">Luke 7:50</a>). He said, 'The manner of this dismission is exceedingly affecting'" (<span class= "ital">Life of Johnson,</span> ch. 4, under the date 1780). For other illustrations of this supreme and unique phase of the Christian life, we may turn to the hymns of Cowper, especially those stanzas commencing "Sometimes a light surprises," "So shall my walk be close with God," "Fierce passions discompose the mind," "There if Thy Spirit touch the soul"; or to some of the descriptions in the <span class= "ital">Pilgrim's Progress.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-21.</span> - (6) The <span class="accented">results of the revelation of the righteousness of God, as affecting</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the consciousness and hopes of believers; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the position of mankind before God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - (<span class="accented">a</span>) <span class="accented">As to the consciousness of individual believers.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ</span>. Instead of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of the Textus Receptus, an overwhelming preponderance of authority, including uncials, versions, and Fathers, supports <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> ("let us have"). If this be the true reading, the expression must be intended as hortatory, meaning, apparently, "Let us appreciate and realize our peace with God which we have in being justified by faith." But hortation here does not appear in keeping with what follows, in which the results of our being justified by faith are described in terms clearly, corresponding with the idea of our having peace with God. The passage as a whole is not hortatory, but descriptive, and "we have peace" comes in naturally as an initiatory statement of what is afterwards carried out. This being the case, it is a question whether an exception may not be allowed in this case to the usually sound rule of bowing to decided preponderance of authority with respect to readings. That <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> was an early and widely accepted reading there can be no doubt; but still it may not have been the original one, the other appearing more probable. Scrivener is of opinion that "the itacism of <span class="greek">&#x3c9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;</span>, so familiar to all collators of Greek manuscripts, crept into some very early copy, from which it was propagated among our most venerable codices, even those from which the earliest versions were made." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 A blessed change takes place in the sinner's state, when he becomes a true believer, whatever he has been. Being justified by faith he has peace with God. The holy, righteous God, cannot be at peace with a sinner, while under the guilt of sin. Justification takes away the guilt, and so makes way for peace. This is through our Lord Jesus Christ; through him as the great Peace-maker, the Mediator between God and man. The saints' happy state is a state of grace. Into this grace we are brought, which teaches that we were not born in this state. We could not have got into it of ourselves, but we are led into it, as pardoned offenders. Therein we stand, a posture that denotes perseverance; we stand firm and safe, upheld by the power of the enemy. And those who have hope for the glory of God hereafter, have enough to rejoice in now. Tribulation worketh patience, not in and of itself, but the powerful grace of God working in and with the tribulation. Patient sufferers have most of the Divine consolations, which abound as afflictions abound. It works needful experience of ourselves. This hope will not disappoint, because it is sealed with the Holy Spirit as a Spirit of love. It is the gracious work of the blessed Spirit to shed abroad the love of God in the hearts of all the saints. A right sense of God's love to us, will make us not ashamed, either of our hope, or of our sufferings for him.</body></html>
