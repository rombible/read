For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by</span> (literally, in) <span class="cmt_word">his life</span>. In these verses, the second being an amplification of the first, our relations to God are set forth, as before, by the analogy of such as may subsist between man and man. Men do not usually die for their enemies, but they do seek the good of their friends. If, then, God's superhuman love reconciled us to himself through the death of his Son when we were still his enemies, what assurance may we not now feel, being no longer at enmity, of being saved from the wrath (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 9) to which, as sinners and enemies, we were exposed! There is also a significance (ver. 10)in the words "death" and "life." Christ's death was for atonement, and in it we are conceived as having died with him to our former state of alienation from God. His resurrection was the inauguration of a new life to God, in which with him we live (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3</a>, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>). The words "enemies" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) and "reconciled" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) invite attention. Does the former word imply mutual enmity, or only that we were God's enemies? We may answer that, though we cannot attribute enmity in its proper human sense to God, or properly speak of him as under any circumstances the enemy of man, yet the expression might perhaps be used with regard to him in the way of accommodation to human ideas, as are anger, <span class="accented">jealousy</span>, and the like. There seems, however, to be no necessity for this conception here, the idea being rather that of man's alienation from God, and from peace with him, through sin; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>, "And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works." So Theoderet interprets: <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="accented">So too</span>, Clem.

With regard to reconciled," it may be first observed that, however orthodox and capable of a true sense it may be to speak of God being reconciled to man through Christ (as in Art. 2, "to reconcile his Father to us"), the expression is not scriptural. It is always man who is said to be reconciled to God; and it is God who, in Christ, reconciles the world unto himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>). Still, mere is evidently implied than that God reconciles men to himself by changing their hearts and converting them from sin by the manifestation of his love in Christ. The reconciliation is spoken of as effected once for all for all mankind in the atonement, independently of, and previously to, the conversion of believers. Faith only appropriates, and obedience testifies, the appropriation of an accomplished reconciliation available for all mankind. That such is the view in the passage before us is distinctly evident from all that follows after ver. 12. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-11 Christ died for sinners; not only such as were useless, but such as were guilty and hateful; such that their everlasting destruction would be to the glory of God's justice. Christ died to save us, not in our sins, but from our sins; and we were yet sinners when he died for us. Nay, the carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself, chap. 8:7; Col 1:21. But God designed to deliver from sin, and to work a great change. While the sinful state continues, God loathes the sinner, and the sinner loathes God, Zec 11:8. And that for such as these Christ should die, is a mystery; no other such an instance of love is known, so that it may well be the employment of eternity to adore and wonder at it. Again; what idea had the apostle when he supposed the case of some one dying for a righteous man? And yet he only put it as a thing that might be. Was it not the undergoing this suffering, that the person intended to be benefitted might be released therefrom? But from what are believers in Christ released by his death? Not from bodily death; for that they all do and must endure. The evil, from which the deliverance could be effected only in this astonishing manner, must be more dreadful than natural death. There is no evil, to which the argument can be applied, except that which the apostle actually affirms, sin, and wrath, the punishment of sin, determined by the unerring justice of God. And if, by Divine grace, they were thus brought to repent, and to believe in Christ, and thus were justified by the price of his bloodshedding, and by faith in that atonement, much more through Him who died for them and rose again, would they be kept from falling under the power of sin and Satan, or departing finally from him. The living Lord of all, will complete the purpose of his dying love, by saving all true believers to the uttermost. Having such a pledge of salvation in the love of God through Christ, the apostle declared that believers not only rejoiced in the hope of heaven, and even in their tribulations for Christ's sake, but they gloried in God also, as their unchangeable Friend and all-sufficient Portion, through Christ only.</body></html>
