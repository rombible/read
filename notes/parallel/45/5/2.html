Our translators seem in this verse to have departed from their usual rendering because of the substantive "glory," in a different sense, which follows) <span class="cmt_word">in hope of the glory of God</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> (translated "access") occurs in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a> and Ephesians 3:12; in both cases, as here, with the article, so as to denote some well-known access or approach. It means the access to the holy God, which had been barred by sin, but which has been opened to us through Christ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19</a>). It is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is properly taken (as in the Authorized Version) in immediate connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, as denoting that <span class="accented">into</span> which we have our access. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a> the word is followed by the more suitable preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, the phrase being, "access to the Father;" and this may be understood here, the sense being, "We have through Christ our access (<span class="accented">to the Father</span>) <span class="accented">unto</span> (ie. so as to result in) the state of grace and acceptance in which we now stand." As to "the glory of God," see above on Romans 3:23. Here our hoped-for <span class="accented">future</span> participation in the Divine glory is more distinctly intimated by the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>. This last phrase bears the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>, and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18</a> above. It does not mean that hope is that wherein we glory, but that, being in a state of hope, we glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 A blessed change takes place in the sinner's state, when he becomes a true believer, whatever he has been. Being justified by faith he has peace with God. The holy, righteous God, cannot be at peace with a sinner, while under the guilt of sin. Justification takes away the guilt, and so makes way for peace. This is through our Lord Jesus Christ; through him as the great Peace-maker, the Mediator between God and man. The saints' happy state is a state of grace. Into this grace we are brought, which teaches that we were not born in this state. We could not have got into it of ourselves, but we are led into it, as pardoned offenders. Therein we stand, a posture that denotes perseverance; we stand firm and safe, upheld by the power of the enemy. And those who have hope for the glory of God hereafter, have enough to rejoice in now. Tribulation worketh patience, not in and of itself, but the powerful grace of God working in and with the tribulation. Patient sufferers have most of the Divine consolations, which abound as afflictions abound. It works needful experience of ourselves. This hope will not disappoint, because it is sealed with the Holy Spirit as a Spirit of love. It is the gracious work of the blessed Spirit to shed abroad the love of God in the hearts of all the saints. A right sense of God's love to us, will make us not ashamed, either of our hope, or of our sufferings for him.</body></html>
