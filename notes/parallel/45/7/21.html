In any case "<span class= "ital">a</span> law" should be rather "<span class= "ital">the</span> law." This is taken by the majority of commentators, including Bishop Ellicott, in the sense of "rule," "habitually-repeated fact." "I find this law, or this rule, that when I would do good evil is present with me." Such is my constant and regular experience. The objection to this interpretation is that it gives to the word "law" an entirely different sense from that which it bears in the context, or in any other part of St. Paul's writings. The other view is that which is maintained by Dr. Vaughan. According to this we should have to assume an <span class= "ital">anacoluthon.</span> The Apostle begins the sentence as if he were going to say, "I find therefore the Law (the Mosaic law), when I desire to do good, <span class= "ital">unable to help me;"</span> but he changes somewhat the form of the sentence in the latter portion, and instead of saying "I find the Law unable to help me," he says, "I find that evil is at my side." "To me" is also repeated a second time, in the Greek superfluously, for the sake of greater clearness. Or perhaps a still simpler and better explanation would be that the Apostle had intended in the first instance to say, "I find the Law, when I wish to do good, <span class= "ital">putting evil before me</span>," and then shrank (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a>) from using so harsh an expression, and softened it by turning the latter half of the sentence into a passive instead of an active form--"I find the Law, when I wish to do good--that evil <span class= "ital">is put</span> before me."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:18-22 The more pure and holy the heart is, it will have the more quick feeling as to the sin that remains in it. The believer sees more of the beauty of holiness and the excellence of the law. His earnest desires to obey, increase as he grows in grace. But the whole good on which his will is fully bent, he does not do; sin ever springing up in him, through remaining corruption, he often does evil, though against the fixed determination of his will. The motions of sin within grieved the apostle. If by the striving of the flesh against the Spirit, was meant that he could not do or perform as the Spirit suggested, so also, by the effectual opposition of the Spirit, he could not do what the flesh prompted him to do. How different this case from that of those who make themselves easy with regard to the inward motions of the flesh prompting them to evil; who, against the light and warning of conscience, go on, even in outward practice, to do evil, and thus, with forethought, go on in the road to perdition! For as the believer is under grace, and his will is for the way of holiness, he sincerely delights in the law of God, and in the holiness which it demands, according to his inward man; that new man in him, which after God is created in true holiness.</body></html>
