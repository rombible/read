The true reading runs thus: "But as it is we were" (not "are") "delivered from the Law, having died to that wherein we were held." In the act of our baptism, which united us to Christ, we obtained a release from our old tyrant, the Law.<p><span class= "bld">Wherein we were held.</span>--Oppressed, held in bondage.<p><span class= "bld">That we should serve.</span>--Rather, perhaps, <span class= "ital">so that we serve;</span> result, not purpose. Our release from one master implied an engagement to another. Our new state is one in which we serve an active living Spirit; our old state was a bondage to the dead and formal letter.<p>The "Spirit" is here the Holy Spirit, as the animating principle of the new life, and as opposed to a system which proceeds merely by external precepts and requirements.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (meaning, as <span class="accented">things are</span>, not <span class="accented">at the present time</span>, as is shown by the aorist following) <span class="cmt_word">we have been</span> (properly, <span class="accented">we were</span>) delivered (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, the same verb as in ver. 2; see note on that verse) <span class="cmt_word">from the Law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in oldness of the letter</span>. In the word "serve" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) we observe a resumption of the idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, where we were regarded under the aspect of being still bond-servants, though to a new master. There the apostle intimated that he was but speaking humanly in describing our new allegiance to righteousness as bond-service, such as we had once been under. Here he intimates the true character of our new service by the addition of the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These are characteristic and significant expressions. "Spirit" and "letter" are similarly contrasted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>). "Spiritum literae opponit, quia antequam ad Dei voluntatem voluntas nostra per Spiritum sanctum formats sit, non habemus in Lege nisi externam literam; quae fraenum quidem externis nostris actionibus injicit, concupiscientiae autem nostrae furorem minime cohibet. Novitatem. vero Spiritui attribuit, quia in locum veteris hominis succedit; ut litera vetus dicitur quae interit per Spiritus regenerationem" (Calvin). Otherwise, with regard to <span class="accented">newness</span> and <span class="accented">old</span>ness, "Vetustatis et novitatis vocabulo Paulus spectat duo testamenta" (Bengel). That the latter idea may have suggested the expressions seems not unlikely from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-18</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>). For in both these passages the idea of the verse before us enters, and in both the old and new covenants are contrasted with regard to it. It may be enough here to say that the contrast in its essence is between exacted conformity to an external code (which was the characteristic of the old covenant) and inspired allegiance to the Law of God written on the heart (which is the characteristic of the new). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 So long as a man continues under the law as a covenant, and seeks justification by his own obedience, he continues the slave of sin in some form. Nothing but the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, can make any sinner free from the law of sin and death. Believers are delivered from that power of the law, which condemns for the sins committed by them. And they are delivered from that power of the law which stirs up and provokes the sin that dwells in them. Understand this not of the law as a rule, but as a covenant of works. In profession and privilege, we are under a covenant of grace, and not under a covenant of works; under the gospel of Christ, not under the law of Moses. The difference is spoken of under the similitude or figure of being married to a new husband. The second marriage is to Christ. By death we are freed from obligation to the law as a covenant, as the wife is from her vows to her husband. In our believing powerfully and effectually, we are dead to the law, and have no more to do with it than the dead servant, who is freed from his master, has to do with his master's yoke. The day of our believing, is the day of being united to the Lord Jesus. We enter upon a life of dependence on him, and duty to him. Good works are from union with Christ; as the fruitfulness of the vine is the product of its being united to its roots; there is no fruit to God, till we are united to Christ. The law, and the greatest efforts of one under the law, still in the flesh, under the power of corrupt principles, cannot set the heart right with regard to the love of God, overcome worldly lusts, or give truth and sincerity in the inward parts, or any thing that comes by the special sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit. Nothing more than a formal obedience to the outward letter of any precept, can be performed by us, without the renewing, new-creating grace of the new covenant.</body></html>
