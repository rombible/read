Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit unto God</span>. The general drift of the above verses is plain enough; namely, that, as in all cases death frees a man from the claims of human law, and, in particular, as death frees the wife from the claims of marital law, so that she may marry again, so the death of Christ, into which we were baptized, frees us from the claims of the law which formerly bound us, so that we may be married spiritually to the risen Saviour, apart from the old dominion of law, and consequently of sin. But it is not so easy to explain the intended analogy in precise terms, there being an apparent discrepance between the illustration and the application with regard to the parties supposed to die. Even before the application there is a seeming discrepance of this kind between the general statement of ver. 1 and the instance given in ver. 2. For in ver. 1 it is (according to the view we have taken of it) the death of the person who had been under law that frees him from it, whereas in ver. 2 it is the death of the husband (representing law) that frees the wife from the law she had been under. Hence the interpretation of ver. 1 above referred to, according to which <span class="accented">law</span>, and not a <span class="accented">man</span>, is the understood nominative to <span class="accented">liveth.</span> But, even if this interpretation were considered tenable, we should not thus get rid of the subsequent apparent discrepance between the illustration and the application. For in the former it is the death of the husband that frees the wife; whereas in the latter it seems to be the death of ourselves, who answer to the wife, in the death of Christ, that frees us. For that it is ourselves that are regarded as having died to the Law with Christ appears not only from other passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> vers. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, in ch. 6.), but also, in the passage before us, from <span class="greek">&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 4, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 6. (The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Textus Receptus rests on no authority, being apparently only a conjecture of Beza's.) There are various ways of explaining. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That (notwithstanding the reasons against the supposition that have just been given) it is the <span class="accented">Law</span>, and not the <span class="accented">man</span>, that is conceived as having died in the death of Christ. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a> may be referred to as supporting this conception. Thus the illustration and the application are made to hang together, the law of the husband being regarded as having died in the husband's death, as <span class="accented">the Law</span> generally to us in Christ's death; and we have already seen how ver. 1 may be forced into correspondence. This view of the Law itself being regarded as having died has the weighty support of Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Ambrose, and other Greek Fathers. Chrysostom accounts for the apostle introducing a different conception in ver. 4: by suggesting that he avoided saying explicitly that the Law had died, for fear of wounding the Jews: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f6c;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. This explanation hardly commends itself as satisfactory; and besides, in addition to what has been already said, it may be observed that throughout the whole passage there is no phrase to suggest in itself the idea of the <span class="accented">Law's</span> death, but only of <span class="accented">some</span> death which emancipates from law (ver. I being taken in its natural sense, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, in ver. 4, being accepted as the undoubtedly true reading). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That in the illustration the wife is really supposed to die when the husband dies. The death of either party to the marriage-bond cancels it; and when one dies, the other virtually dies to the law that both were under. Thus the statement of principle in ver. 1, the particular illustration in vers. 2, 3, and the application are made to hang together. Meyer takes this view decidedly, and cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm">Ephesians 5:28</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, to show that the husband's death may be considered as implying the wife's death also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That there is a discrepance between the illustration and the application, the husband being regarded as dying in the former, and ourselves, who represent the wife, in the latter; but that this is of no consequence; the idea, common to both, of <span class="accented">death</span> abrogating the claims of law being sufficient for the apostle's argument. Death, it may be said, however regarded in the application, is an ideal conception, and not an actual fact with respect to ourselves; and it is immaterial how it is regarded, as long as the idea comes out that through death, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ours in the death of Christ, we are freed from the dominion of law. (So, in effect, De Wette, and also Alford.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> That the former husband is not the law, but <span class="accented">the lust of sin</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 5); the wife, the <span class="accented">soul</span>; the new husband, <span class="accented">Christ.</span> Augustine, who is the author of this view, puts it thus: "Cum ergo tria sint, <span class="accented">anima</span>, tanquam <span class="accented">mulier</span>; <span class="accented">passiones peccatorum</span> tanquam <span class="accented">vir</span>; et <span class="accented">lex</span> tanquam <span class="accented">lex viri</span>; non ibi peccatis mortuis, tanquam viro mortuo liberari animam dicit, sed ipsam animam mort peccato, et liberari a lege, ut sit alterius viri, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christi, cum mortua fuerit peccato, quod fit, cum adhuc manentibus in nobis desideriis et incitamentis quibusdam ad peccandum, non obedi-mus tamen, nec consentimus, mente servientes legi Dei" (Aug., 'Prop.,' 33). Beza, taking up the view of Augustine, puts it somewhat differently, and more clearly, thus: "There are two marriages. In the first, the <span class="accented">old man</span> is the <span class="accented">wife</span>; <span class="accented">predominating sinful desires</span>, the <span class="accented">husband</span>; <span class="accented">transgressions</span> of every kind, the <span class="accented">offspring.</span> In the second, the <span class="accented">new man</span> is the <span class="accented">wife</span>; <span class="accented">Christ</span>, the <span class="accented">Husband</span>; and the <span class="accented">fruits of the Spirit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) are the <span class="accented">children."</span> This explanation being still apparently open to the objection that, in the illustration, the wife continues the same, but not so that which corresponds to her in the application, Olshausen explains thus: "In man the old man is distinguished from the new without prejudice to the unity of his personality, which Paul subsequently (ver. 20) signifies by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>. This true personality, the proper self of man, is the wife, who in the natural state appears in marriage with the old man, and, in intercourse with him, generates sins, the end of which is death (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21, 22</a>). But in the death of the mortal Christ this old man is dead with him; and, as the individual man is grafted by faith into Christ. his old man dies, by whose life he was holden under the Law." The commentator on the Epistle in the 'Speaker's Commentary' adopts this explanation, with the remark that "St. Paul's application of the figure is quite clear, if we follow his own guidance." The view rests mainly on, and certainly derives some support from, vers. 5 and 6, if regarded as carrying out the application of the figure. Others, however, in view of the difficulties of the whole passage, may prefer to content themselves with explanation (3), as conveying as precise an idea as may possibly have been even in the apostle's mind when he wrote. Commentators may sometimes go beyond their office in attributing to their author more exactness of thought than his words in themselves imply. It is to be observed that the con-eluding expression in ver. 4, "that we should bring forth fruit unto God," brings us back to the main purport of this whole section, which begins at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1</a>, viz. the obligation of a holy life on Christians. In vers. 5, 6, which follow, the hindrance to our living such a life "when we were in the flesh," and our power of doing so now, are briefly intimated in preparation for what follows. It does not seem necessary to conclude - as is done by those who adopt interpretation (4) of what precedes - that the illustration of the marriage bond is meant to be kept up in these two verses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 So long as a man continues under the law as a covenant, and seeks justification by his own obedience, he continues the slave of sin in some form. Nothing but the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, can make any sinner free from the law of sin and death. Believers are delivered from that power of the law, which condemns for the sins committed by them. And they are delivered from that power of the law which stirs up and provokes the sin that dwells in them. Understand this not of the law as a rule, but as a covenant of works. In profession and privilege, we are under a covenant of grace, and not under a covenant of works; under the gospel of Christ, not under the law of Moses. The difference is spoken of under the similitude or figure of being married to a new husband. The second marriage is to Christ. By death we are freed from obligation to the law as a covenant, as the wife is from her vows to her husband. In our believing powerfully and effectually, we are dead to the law, and have no more to do with it than the dead servant, who is freed from his master, has to do with his master's yoke. The day of our believing, is the day of being united to the Lord Jesus. We enter upon a life of dependence on him, and duty to him. Good works are from union with Christ; as the fruitfulness of the vine is the product of its being united to its roots; there is no fruit to God, till we are united to Christ. The law, and the greatest efforts of one under the law, still in the flesh, under the power of corrupt principles, cannot set the heart right with regard to the love of God, overcome worldly lusts, or give truth and sincerity in the inward parts, or any thing that comes by the special sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit. Nothing more than a formal obedience to the outward letter of any precept, can be performed by us, without the renewing, new-creating grace of the new covenant.</body></html>
