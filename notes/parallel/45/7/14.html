On the other hand, man, though capable of communion with God, is dominated by that part of his nature which is the direct opposite of divine, and is entirely earthly and sensual. This sensual part of his nature is the slave--and just as much the slave as if he had been sold in the auction mart--of Sin. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm" title="And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy?

The statement of ver. 12 is here in effect repeated as being one that cannot be gainsaid with respect to <span class="accented">the Law</span>, but with use now of the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; and this in opposition to <span class="accented">myself</span> being <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The new word, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, is obviously meant to express a further idea with respect to law, suitable to the line of thought now about to be pursued. Without lingering to mention varying suggestions of various commentators as to the sense in which the Law is here called <span class="accented">spiritual</span>, we may offer the following considerations in elucidation. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> are, as is well known, constantly contrasted in the New Testament. The former sometimes denotes the "Holy Spirit of God," and sometimes that highest part in ourselves which is in touch with the Divine Spirit. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, though it may, in accordance with its original meaning, sometimes denote our mere bodily organization, is usually used to express our whole present human constitution, mental as well as bodily, considered as apart from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. When St. Paul in one place distinguishes the constituent elements of human nature, he speaks of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). There <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> seems to denote the animal life or soul animating the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> for the purposes of mere human life, but distinguished from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, which associates him with the Divine life. Usually, however, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> alone are spoken of; so that the term <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> seems to include the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, expressing our whole weak human nature now, apart from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, which connects us with God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>, etc.). That in this and other passages <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> does not mean our mere bodily organization only, is further evident from sins not due to mere bodily lusts - such as want of affection, hatred, envy, pride - being called "works of the flesh" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>). What, then, is meant by the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>? Applied to man, it is, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2, 3</a>, opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, to <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm">Jude 1:19</a>); the latter word apparently meaning one in whom the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> (as above understood), and not the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, dominates. Further, St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>) speaks of a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> and a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, meaning by the former a tenement fitted for and adequate to the mere <span class="accented">psychic</span> life, and by the latter a new organism adapted for the higher life of the <span class="accented">spirit</span>, such as we hope to have hereafter; and in the same passage he uses the neuters, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, with reference to "the first Adam," who was made, or became (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and "the last Adam," who was made <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>. Thus <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, generally, denotes the <span class="accented">Divine</span>, which man apprehends and aspires to, nay, in which he has himself a part in virtue of the original breathing into him of the breath of life (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) directly from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>), whereby he became a living soul (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) for the purposes of his mundane life (itself above that of the brutes), but retained also a share of the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> connecting him with God,and capable of being quickened so as to be the dominant principle of his being through contact with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>. It would seem that the Law is here called <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, as belonging to the Divine sphere of things, and expressive of the Divine order. "The Law, both the moral law in the bosom of man, and the expression of that law in the Decalogue, is, as Augustine profoundly expresses it, a revelation of the higher order of things founded in the being of God. It is hence a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (Tholuck). But man (t<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>), though still able to admire, nay, to delight in and aspire to, this higher order, cannot yet conform himself to it because of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, infected with sin, which at present enthrals him: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. Thus is fitly introduced the analysis of human consciousness with reference to law which follows. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (which, rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, is the best-supported reading) may be used to express merely our present constitution &Ntilde; our being <span class="accented">of flesh -</span> so as to account for our inability, rather than our being <span class="accented">fleshly</span>, or carnally minded, as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> would imply. In two other passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm">Hebrews 7:16</a>) authority is also in favour of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> as in the Textus Receptus. Tholuck, however, doubts whether there was, in common usage, a distinction between the meaning of the two forms. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> significant. It denotes, not our having been originally slaves (<span class="accented">vernae</span>), but our having been sold into slavery (<span class="accented">capri</span>). Slavery to sin is not the rightful condition of our nature. We are as the Israelites in Egypt, or as the captives in Babylon who remembered Zion. Hence the possibility of deliverance, if we feel the burden of our slavery and long to be free, when the Deliverer comes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-17 Compared with the holy rule of conduct in the law of God, the apostle found himself so very far short of perfection, that he seemed to be carnal; like a man who is sold against his will to a hated master, from whom he cannot set himself at liberty. A real Christian unwillingly serves this hated master, yet cannot shake off the galling chain, till his powerful and gracious Friend above, rescues him. The remaining evil of his heart is a real and humbling hinderance to his serving God as angels do and the spirits of just made perfect. This strong language was the result of St. Paul's great advance in holiness, and the depth of his self-abasement and hatred of sin. If we do not understand this language, it is because we are so far beneath him in holiness, knowledge of the spirituality of God's law, and the evil of our own hearts, and hatred of moral evil. And many believers have adopted the apostle's language, showing that it is suitable to their deep feelings of abhorrence of sin, and self-abasement. The apostle enlarges on the conflict he daily maintained with the remainder of his original depravity. He was frequently led into tempers, words, or actions, which he did not approve or allow in his renewed judgement and affections. By distinguishing his real self, his spiritual part, from the self, or flesh, in which sin dwelt, and by observing that the evil actions were done, not by him, but by sin dwelling in him, the apostle did not mean that men are not accountable for their sins, but he teaches the evil of their sins, by showing that they are all done against reason and conscience. Sin dwelling in a man, does not prove its ruling, or having dominion over him. If a man dwells in a city, or in a country, still he may not rule there.</body></html>
