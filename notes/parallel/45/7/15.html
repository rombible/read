O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</span> (probably in the same sense as "the body of sin" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; see note thereon. Translate certainly as in the English Version; not <span class="accented">this body of death</span>, as if it meant <span class="accented">this mortal</span> body) <span class="cmt_word">Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the Law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</span> In the note introducing this whole section (vers. 7-25)its general drift has been intimated. The following additional comments may further explain the part of it which begins at ver. 15. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The initial <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> introduces proof of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> being in the condition spoken of in the preceding clause, viz. "sold under sin." For (the meaning is) am I not a bond-slave, when, as I feel is the case with me, I am not my own master? But, observe, the state that goes on to be described is that of an unwilling bond-slave; not of one who likes his bondage, and has no desire to be free. The conscience is supposed already, through the operation of law, to protest against sin; to hate its thraldom; not willingly to acquiesce in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The distinction between the verbs <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not observed in the English Version, but to which attention has been drawn in the above translation, has its meaning. Attention to the places where they occur will show their appropriateness in each case, denoting severally single acts, habitual practice, and general working, performance, or accomplishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The English Version is wrong in rendering, in ver. 15, "What I would, that I do not," so as to make the idea the same as that in ver. 19. There are really two different statements in the two verses - the first, of our doing what we wish not to do; the second, of our not doing what we wish to do; and after each the same conclusion is drawn in the same words, viz. that sin is the real worker (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> being here the word appropriately used). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The conflicting principles, or energies, of human nature, between which the individual <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, which wills and acts, is here regarded as being distracted, are the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> in which sin dwells (which has been explained above; see note under ver. 14) on the one hand, and the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 23) of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 22) on the other. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is identified with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rather than regarded as an intermediate personality between the two. For it is spoken of throughout as willing what is good; and,. though in ver. 14 it is said to be <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and though, in ver. 18, good dwells not in it, yet the first of these expressions only means that it is in the flesh at present, and therefore in bondage; and the latter is at once qualified by the addition, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; it does not identify the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> with the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. It is, we may remark in passing, this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> - that is regarded as rising to a new life with Christ, so as to become a <span class="accented">new man</span>, delivered from bondage; this last expression, of course, involving a different idea from that of the <span class="accented">inward man</span>). It is to be observed, further, that throughout this section beginning at ver. 7, there is no distinction drawn (as elsewhere by St. Paul) between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>; the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, in fact, does not come in at all, except with regard to the Law, which is called <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The reason is that the apostle is confining himself here to an examination of what man, even at his best, is in his mere human nature; of what thoughtful observers, though not theologians, may perceive him to be. It is a philosophical rather than a theological analysis. It is one that might commend itself to heathen philosophers, some of whom have, in fact, expressed themselves much to the same effect. Hence it is not till ch. 8, where man's regeneration by the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is portrayed, that the spiritual principle in himself, through which he is capable of such regeneration, comes into view. And it will be seen that it is this very idea of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> that pervades that whole chapter. This essential distinction between the two chapters is sufficient in itself to disprove the theory that the regenerate state is described in ch. 7. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The senses in which the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in this chapter require to be perceived and distinguished, its usual sense (see under Romans 2:13) not being uniformly retained. There is, however, always some appended expression to indicate any new application of the word. We find it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> in its usual sense, with the usual significance of the absence or the presence of the article, in vers. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16; and in ver. 22, still in the same sense, we have "the Law of God." We find also, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in ver. 23, "the law of my mind," whereby I delight in the "Law of God." Here "law" assumes a different sense from the other, but one in which the word is often used; as when we speak of the laws of nature, having in view, not so much a fiat external to nature which nature must obey, as the uniform rule according to which nature is found to work. The Latin word <span class="accented">norma</span> expresses the idea. Thus "the law of my mind" means the normal constitution of my higher and better self, whereby it cannot but assent to "the Law of God. Then <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> we have "the law of sin in my members;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in a similar sense, an antagonistic rule or constitution dominant in my <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. Lastly, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> in ver. 21, the general law (in like sense) of my complex human nature, which necessitates this antagonism: "the law, <span class="accented">that</span> when I would do good" (in accordance with the law of the mind), "evil is present with me" (in virtue of the other law). Ancient and other commentators have been much puzzled as to the meaning of ver. 21, from taking <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> at the beginning to denote the Mosaic Law, as <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> usually does when preceded by the article. But not so when there is something after it to denote a different meaning; as there is here in the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> at the end of the verse, meaning <span class="accented">that</span>, not (as some have understood it) <span class="accented">because.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Difficulty has been found in the concluding clause of ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, etc. It follows the expression of thanksgiving, "Thanks be to God," etc., which certainly introduced the thought of deliverance from the state that had been described; and hence it is supposed by some that this clause must be a continuance of that thought, and so to be taken as an introduction to ch. 8. rather than a summing up of the preceding argument. It is said also, in support of this view, that more entire association of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> with the Law of God than was before intimated is here expressed; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> being written instead of simply <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> being a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (ver. 22). Thus the meaning would be, "Though in my flesh I still serve the law of sin (the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> still remains in me, notwithstanding my regeneration), yet now <span class="accented">in my very real self</span> I not only <span class="accented">approve</span>, but <span class="accented">am in subjection to</span>, the Law of God." It is, however, at least a question whether these slight differences of expression come to much; and both the introductory <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> and the form of the clause suggest rather its being the summarized result of ch. 7. The additional emphasis added to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> (which had, indeed, already been emphatic), and the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, may serve only to bring out all the more strongly in the end what it had been the purpose of the whole passage to lead up to, viz. that man's real self, when conscience is fully aroused, yearns for and is ready for redemption. There is no difficulty in so understanding the clause (as we should surely understand it naturally but for the preceding thanksgiving), if we regard the thanksgiving as a parenthetical exclamation, anticipating for a moment the purport of ch. 8. Such an exclamation is characteristic of St. Paul, and it adds life to the passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-17 Compared with the holy rule of conduct in the law of God, the apostle found himself so very far short of perfection, that he seemed to be carnal; like a man who is sold against his will to a hated master, from whom he cannot set himself at liberty. A real Christian unwillingly serves this hated master, yet cannot shake off the galling chain, till his powerful and gracious Friend above, rescues him. The remaining evil of his heart is a real and humbling hinderance to his serving God as angels do and the spirits of just made perfect. This strong language was the result of St. Paul's great advance in holiness, and the depth of his self-abasement and hatred of sin. If we do not understand this language, it is because we are so far beneath him in holiness, knowledge of the spirituality of God's law, and the evil of our own hearts, and hatred of moral evil. And many believers have adopted the apostle's language, showing that it is suitable to their deep feelings of abhorrence of sin, and self-abasement. The apostle enlarges on the conflict he daily maintained with the remainder of his original depravity. He was frequently led into tempers, words, or actions, which he did not approve or allow in his renewed judgement and affections. By distinguishing his real self, his spiritual part, from the self, or flesh, in which sin dwelt, and by observing that the evil actions were done, not by him, but by sin dwelling in him, the apostle did not mean that men are not accountable for their sins, but he teaches the evil of their sins, by showing that they are all done against reason and conscience. Sin dwelling in a man, does not prove its ruling, or having dominion over him. If a man dwells in a city, or in a country, still he may not rule there.</body></html>
