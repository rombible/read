Sin is unable to. act upon man without the co-operation of law, without being able to hold up law before him, and so show itself in its true colours.<p>The words "by the commandment" may either go with "taking occasion" or with "wrought in me." The sense would, in either case, be very much the same, "taking advantage of the commandment," or "wrought in me by the help of the commandment." The first is the construction usually adopted, as in the Authorised version, but there seem to be reasons of some force for preferring the second. The phrase "wrought in me coveting by the commandment" would thus be parallel to "working death in me by that which is good," below.<p><span class= "bld">Concupiscence.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">coveting;</span> the same word which had been used above. Sin and the Commandment together--Sin, the evil principle in men, acting as the primary cause, and the Commandment as the secondary cause--led their unfortunate victim into all kinds of violation of the Law. This is done in two ways: (1) the perverseness of human nature is such that the mere prohibition of an act suggests the desire to do that which is prohibited; (2) the act, when done, is invested with the character of sin, which hitherto it did not possess. It becomes a distinct breach of law, where previously there had been no law to break. This is what the Apostle means by saying that "without the Law sin was dead." Until there was a written prohibition, Sin (the evil principle) was powerless to produce sinful actions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But sin, taking occasion, through the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence</span> (or, <span class="accented">of lust</span>): <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for without</span> (or, <span class="accented">apart from</span>) <span class="cmt_word">law sin is dead</span>. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>., sin is personified as a power, antagonistic to the Law of God, that has been introduced into the world of man, causing death. In ch. 5. its first introduction was found in the scriptural account of Adam's transgression. It has ever since been in the world, as is evidenced by the continuance of the reign of death as it comes to all men now (vers. 13, 14). But it is only when men, through law, know it to be sin, that it is imputed (ver. 13), and so slays them spiritually. Apart from law, it is as it were dead with respect to its power over the soul to kill. It is regarded here as an enemy on the watch, seizing its occasion to kill which is offered it when law comes in. It may be observed here that, though it is not easy to define exactly in all cases what St. Paul means by <span class="accented">death</span>, it is evident that he means in this place more than the <span class="accented">physical</span> death which seemed, at first sight at least, to be exclusively referred to in ch. 5. For <span class="accented">all</span> die in the latter sense of the word; but only those who sin with knowledge of law in the sense intended here (see also note on Romans 5:12). It is supposed by most commentators that the expression <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in this verse means, not only that "the commandment" brought out lust <span class="accented">as sin</span>, but further that it <span class="accented">provoked</span> it, according to the alleged tendency of human nature to long all the more for what is forbidden; <span class="accented">Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata.</span> Whether or not we have this tendency to the extent sometimes supposed, the <span class="accented">context</span> certainly neither requires nor suggests the conception, either here or in vers. 5 and 7. It is true, however, that the <span class="accented">language</span> of vers. 5 and 8 does in itself suggest it. Against it is the reason which follows; "for without law sin is dead," which can hardly mean (as the strong word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> would seem in such case to require) that lust itself is altogether dormant until prohibition excites it. Calvin interprets <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> thus: "Detexit in me omnem concupiscentiam; quae, dum lateret, quo-dammodo nulla esse videbatur;" and on <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> remarks, "Clarissime exprimit quem sensum habeant superiora. Perinde enim est ac si diceret, sepnltam esse sine Legs peccati <span class="accented">notitiam."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:7-13 There is no way of coming to that knowledge of sin, which is necessary to repentance, and therefore to peace and pardon, but by trying our hearts and lives by the law. In his own case the apostle would not have known the sinfulness of his thoughts, motives, and actions, but by the law. That perfect standard showed how wrong his heart and life were, proving his sins to be more numerous than he had before thought, but it did not contain any provision of mercy or grace for his relief. He is ignorant of human nature and the perverseness of his own heart, who does not perceive in himself a readiness to fancy there is something desirable in what is out of reach. We may perceive this in our children, though self-love makes us blind to it in ourselves. The more humble and spiritual any Christian is, the more clearly will he perceive that the apostle describes the true believer, from his first convictions of sin to his greatest progress in grace, during this present imperfect state. St. Paul was once a Pharisee, ignorant of the spirituality of the law, having some correctness of character, without knowing his inward depravity. When the commandment came to his conscience by the convictions of the Holy Spirit, and he saw what it demanded, he found his sinful mind rise against it. He felt at the same time the evil of sin, his own sinful state, that he was unable to fulfil the law, and was like a criminal when condemned. But though the evil principle in the human heart produces sinful motions, and the more by taking occasion of the commandment; yet the law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good. It is not favourable to sin, which it pursues into the heart, and discovers and reproves in the inward motions thereof. Nothing is so good but a corrupt and vicious nature will pervert it. The same heat that softens wax, hardens clay. Food or medicine when taken wrong, may cause death, though its nature is to nourish or to heal. The law may cause death through man's depravity, but sin is the poison that brings death. Not the law, but sin discovered by the law, was made death to the apostle. The ruinous nature of sin, and the sinfulness of the human heart, are here clearly shown.</body></html>
