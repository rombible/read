The same military metaphor is kept up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm" title="For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:23</a>, "the wages of sin" (your pay as soldiers of sin) "is death."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God</span>. By our <span class="accented">members</span> seem to be meant, not merely the several parts of our bodily frame - eye. tongue, hand, foot, etc. - but generally all the parts or constituents of our present human nature, which sin may use as its instruments, but which ought to be devoted to God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). Many commentators would translate <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> "weapons" rather than "instruments," on the ground that St. Paul usually uses the word in this sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11, 13</a>); and also that <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 22, taken in the sense of the pay of a soldier (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm">Luke 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>), is supposed to imply that the apostle has had all along the idea of <span class="accented">warfare</span> in view. The second of these reasons really proves nothing. Whatever the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23, it is too far removed from the passage before us to be taken in any connection with it. Neither is the first reason at all cogent. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> bears the sense of <span class="accented">instruments</span> as well as of <span class="accented">weapons</span>, and may more suitably bear it here. When St. Paul elsewhere speaks of armour, it is the armour of <span class="accented">light</span>, or of <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, which we are told to <span class="accented">take up</span>, and to <span class="accented">put on, in</span> order to fight against our spiritual enemies. Such a conception is inapplicable to our own <span class="accented">members</span>, which we have already, which we may use either for good or evil, and which require the protection of heavenly armour rather than being themselves armour; and we certainly could not be told to take them up or put them on. We may, in the next place, observe that the two clauses of this verse are differently expressed in two respects. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is our <span class="accented">members</span> only that we are forbidden to yield to sin; but <span class="accented">ourselves</span>, with our members, we are bidden to yield to God. For few of the persons addressed, if even any, could be supposed, deliberately and of choice, to offer their whole being to the service of sin as such; they were only liable to succumb to sin, in this or that way, through soliciting lusts. But the regenerate Christian offers and presents his whole serf to God, and desires to be his entirely. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In the first clause we find the present imperative, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; but in the second the aorist imperative, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The distinction between the two tenses in the imperative is thus expressed in Matthiae's 'Greek Grammar:' "that the aorist designates an action passing by, and considered abstractedly in its completion, but the present a continued and frequently repeated action." Our giving ourselves to God is something done once for all; our yielding our members as instruments of sin is a succession of acts of yielding. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-15 The strongest motives against sin, and to enforce holiness, are here stated. Being made free from the reign of sin, alive unto God, and having the prospect of eternal life, it becomes believers to be greatly concerned to advance thereto. But, as unholy lusts are not quite rooted out in this life, it must be the care of the Christian to resist their motions, earnestly striving, that, through Divine grace, they may not prevail in this mortal state. Let the thought that this state will soon be at an end, encourage the true Christian, as to the motions of lusts, which so often perplex and distress him. Let us present all our powers to God, as weapons or tools ready for the warfare, and work of righteousness, in his service. There is strength in the covenant of grace for us. Sin shall not have dominion. God's promises to us are more powerful and effectual for mortifying sin, than our promises to God. Sin may struggle in a real believer, and create him a great deal of trouble, but it shall not have dominion; it may vex him, but it shall not rule over him. Shall any take occasion from this encouraging doctrine to allow themselves in the practice of any sin? Far be such abominable thoughts, so contrary to the perfections of God, and the design of his gospel, so opposed to being under grace. What can be a stronger motive against sin than the love of Christ? Shall we sin against so much goodness, and such love?</body></html>
