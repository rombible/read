Therefore expel sin, and refuse to obey its evil promptings. Keep your bodies pure and clean. Let them no longer be weapons in the hands of wickedness; let them rather be weapons with which to fight the battle of righteousness and of God. You have every encouragement to do this. For sin shall no longer play the tyrant over you. The stern and gloomy Empire of Law (which only served to heighten the guilt of sin) is over, and in its stead the only power to which you are subject is that of free forgiveness.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Mortal.</span>--And therefore at variance with the immortal life just described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof</span>. (The reading of the Textus Receptus, "obey <span class="accented">it in</span> the lusts thereof," has but weak support.) Though our "old man" is conceived of as crucified with Christ - though this is theoretically and potentially our position - yet our actual lives may be at variance with it; for we are still in our present "mortal body," with its lusts remaining; and sin is still a power, not yet destroyed, which <span class="accented">may</span>, if we let it, have domination over us still. Regeneration is not regarded as having changed our nature, or eradicated all our evil propensions, but as having introduced into us a higher power - "the power of his resurrection" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>) - in virtue of which we may resist the attempted domination of sin. But it still rests with us whether we will give our allegiance to sin or to Christ. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Chrysostom). The lusts, obedience to which is equivalent to letting sin reign, are said to be those of our "mortal body," because it is in our present bodily organization that the lusts tempting us to evil rise. But it is not in their soliciting us, but in the will assenting to them, that the sin lies. "Quia non consentimus desideriis pravis in gratia sumus" (Augustine, 'Prop.,' 35). "Cupiditates corporis sunt fomes, peccatum ignis" (Bengel). The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> ("mortal") is fitly used as distinguishing our present perishable framework - the earthen vessels in which we have our treasure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>) - from our real inward personality, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>), which is regarded as having risen with Christ, so as to live to God for ever. "Vos enim, viventes, abalienati estis a corpore vestro (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>)" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-15 The strongest motives against sin, and to enforce holiness, are here stated. Being made free from the reign of sin, alive unto God, and having the prospect of eternal life, it becomes believers to be greatly concerned to advance thereto. But, as unholy lusts are not quite rooted out in this life, it must be the care of the Christian to resist their motions, earnestly striving, that, through Divine grace, they may not prevail in this mortal state. Let the thought that this state will soon be at an end, encourage the true Christian, as to the motions of lusts, which so often perplex and distress him. Let us present all our powers to God, as weapons or tools ready for the warfare, and work of righteousness, in his service. There is strength in the covenant of grace for us. Sin shall not have dominion. God's promises to us are more powerful and effectual for mortifying sin, than our promises to God. Sin may struggle in a real believer, and create him a great deal of trouble, but it shall not have dominion; it may vex him, but it shall not rule over him. Shall any take occasion from this encouraging doctrine to allow themselves in the practice of any sin? Far be such abominable thoughts, so contrary to the perfections of God, and the design of his gospel, so opposed to being under grace. What can be a stronger motive against sin than the love of Christ? Shall we sin against so much goodness, and such love?</body></html>
