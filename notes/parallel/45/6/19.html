Here <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> ("I speak humanly") may be taken as referring to the expression immediately preceding, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>. St. Paul may mean, "In saying you were made <span class="accented">slaves to</span> righteousness, I am using human language not properly applicable to your spiritual relations. For you are not really in bondage now; you have been emancipated from your former bondage to sin, and are now called upon to render a free willing allowance to righteousness; being, in fact, sons, not slaves." This view of the true position of the Christian being one of freedom recurs so often and so forcibly with St. Paul that it is peculiarly likely to be the thought before him here; the very word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> would be likely to suggest it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1, 13</a>). If (he would say) you fully realized your position as sons of God, you would feel it impossible even to think of sinning willingly; but, in accommodation to your human weakness, I put the case as if you had only been transferred from one bondage to another, so as to show that, even so, you are under an <span class="accented">obligation</span> not to sin. According to this view of the meaning of the passage, "the infirmity of your flesh" has reference to dulness of spiritual perception, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> being opposed in a general sense to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. Had they been <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, they would have discerned <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> without need of any such human view of the matter being put before them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). Some, however, taking <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> to denote <span class="accented">moral</span> weakness, which renders the attainment of holiness difficult for man (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>), understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> as meaning, "I require of you no more than is possible &Ntilde; for your frail humanity; for I call on you only to render to righteousness the same allegiance you once rendered to sin." This interpretation gives a totally different meaning to the clause. It has the support of Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Calvin, Estius, Wetstein, and others; but it does not appear so natural or probable as the other, which is accepted by most modern commentators. <span class="cmt_word">For as ye yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto sanctification</span> (rather than <span class="accented">holiness</span>, as in the Authorized Version; the word is <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, always so translated elsewhere). This is a setting forth of what must follow in practice from the view that has been taken of the change in the Christian's position resembling the transference of bondservants from one master to another. They must devote their <span class="accented">members</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> above on ver. 13) to the service of the new master in the same way as they had done to that of the old one; the aims or results of the two services being also intimated. The old service was in giving themselves up to <span class="accented">uncleanness</span> (with reference to sins of sensuality), and generally to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. lawlessness</span>, or disregard of duty; and its result is expressed by a repetition of the latter word. For sin leads to nothing positive; lawless conduct only results in a habit or state of lawlessness; whereas the service of righteousness in itself leads to sanctification to the abiding result of participation in the holiness of God. "Qui justitiae serviunt, proficiunt; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">iniqui</span>, sunt <span class="accented">iniqui</span>, nil amplius" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:16-20 Every man is the servant of the master to whose commands he yields himself; whether it be the sinful dispositions of his heart, in actions which lead to death, or the new and spiritual obedience implanted by regeneration. The apostle rejoiced now they obeyed from the heart the gospel, into which they were delivered as into a mould. As the same metal becomes a new vessel, when melted and recast in another mould, so the believer has become a new creature. And there is great difference in the liberty of mind and spirit, so opposite to the state of slavery, which the true Christian has in the service of his rightful Lord, whom he is enabled to consider as his Father, and himself as his son and heir, by the adoption of grace. The dominion of sin consists in being willingly slaves thereto, not in being harassed by it as a hated power, struggling for victory. Those who now are the servants of God, once were the slaves of sin.</body></html>
