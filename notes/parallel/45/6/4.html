It is the seal set upon it, as it were, which shows that no revival is possible. Besides, it is the one step which separates it from resurrection. The idea of "buried with Christ" is therefore introduced, on the one hand, to show that the ethical death with Him was final and decisive, and on the other, to prepare the way for an ethical (as well <span class= "ital">as</span> physical) resurrection with Him.<p><span class= "bld">Into death.</span>--The ideas of physical and moral death and resurrection and life are inextricably blended in the thought of the Apostle.<p><span class= "bld">By the glory of the Father.</span>--The resurrection of Christ is more usually and more naturally ascribed to the power or Omnipotence of God. The word "Glory" is here to be taken as standing for the sum of the divine perfections, power being included among them, "the Majesty on High."<p><span class= "bld">Even so.</span>--It is to be observed that the mysticism is here resolved into a relation of resemblance. The resurrection of Christ, and the new life of the Christian, are <span class= "ital">compared</span> instead of being identified. The Apostle does not say "being dead with Christ, let us rise with Him;" but, "<span class= "ital">as</span> Christ rose again, <span class= "ital">so</span> we also should walk in newness of life." The mystical expression for this is given in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore we were buried</span> (not <span class="accented">are</span>, as in the Authorized Version<span class="cmt_word">) with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life</span>. The mention here of burial as well as death does not appear to be meant as a further carrying out of the idea of a fulfilment in us of the whole of Christ's experience, in the sense - As he died and was buried, so we die and are even buried too. Such a conception of burial being in our case a further process subsequent to our death in baptism, is indeed well expressed in our Collect for Easter Eve: but the form of expression, "buried into death," does not suit it here. The reference rather is to the form of baptism, viz. by immersion, which was understood to signify burial, and therefore death. So Chrysostom, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3.htm">John 3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>. The main intention of the verse is to bring out the idea of resurrection following death in our case as in Christ's. The sense, therefore, is - As our burial (or total immersion) in the baptismal water was followed by entire emergence, so our death with Christ to sin, which that immersion symbolized, is to be followed by our resurrection with him to a new life. As to the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, through which Christ is here said to have been raised, see what was said under Romans 3:23. "<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> est <span class="accented">gloria</span> divinae vitae, incorruptiblitatis, potentiae, et virtutis, per quam et Christus resuscitatus est, et nos vitae novas restituimur, Deoque conformamur. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, <span class="accented">seqq."</span> (Bengel). In some passages our Lord is regarded as having been raised from the dead in virtue of the Divine life that was in himself, whereby it was impossible that he should be holden of death. (see under Romans 1:4). And he said of his own <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, "I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>). But . here as most commonly elsewhere, his resurrection is attributed to the operation of the glory of the Father - the same Divine power that regenerates us in him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; also our Lord's own prayers to the Father previously to his suffering, as given by St. John). The two views are not inconsistent, and may serve to show Christ's oneness with the Father as touching his Godhead. The marked association here and elsewhere of union with Christ, so as to die and rise again with him, with the rite of baptism, supports the orthodox view of that sacrament being not only a <span class="accented">signum significans</span>, but a <span class="accented">signum efficax</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> not only representing, but being "a means whereby we receive" regeneration. The beginning of the new life of believers, with the power as well as the obligation to lead such a life, is ever regarded as dating from their baptism (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). It is true, however, that in all such passages in the New Testament the baptism of adults is referred to; that is, of persons who at the time of baptism were capable of actual repentance and faith, and hence of actual <span class="accented">moral</span> regeneration, and they are supposed to have understood the significance of the rite, and to have been sincere in seeking it. Hence what is said or implied cannot fairly be pressed as applicable in all respects to infant baptism. This, however, is not the place for discussing the propriety of infant baptism, or the sense in which all baptized persons are regarded by the Church as in their very baptism regenerate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:3-10 Baptism teaches the necessity of dying to sin, and being as it were buried from all ungodly and unholy pursuits, and of rising to walk with God in newness of life. Unholy professors may have had the outward sign of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they never passed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature, called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, is crucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derived from the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yet struggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin, whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, so that the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, and find happiness in his service.</body></html>
