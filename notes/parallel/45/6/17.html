There is no contradiction between what is here said and the fear previously implied lest the persons addressed might still serve sin. He refers them back to the time of their baptism, when he conceives them both to have understood their obligation (cf. ver. 3), and also to have been heartily sincere. The fear was lest they might have relaxed since, perhaps through infection with antinomian teaching. By the "form of doctrine" or "of instruction" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) is not at all likely to be meant (as some have supposed) any distinctive <span class="accented">type</span> of Christian teaching, such as the <span class="accented">Pauline</span> (so Meyer). Usually elsewhere, where St. Paul uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it is of persons being examples or patterns to others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>). Somewhat similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>, Adam is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a> the things which happened to the Israelites in the wilderness were <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> to us. These are all the instances of the use of the word in St. Paul's Epistles. Here, therefore, it may be best to understand it (so as to retain the idea of pattern) as the general Christian code into which converts had been indoctrinated, regarded as a norton <span class="accented">agendi</span> "Norma ilia et regula, ad quam se conformat servus, tautum ei per doctrinam ostenditur; urgeri eum non opus est" (Bengel on <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:16-20 Every man is the servant of the master to whose commands he yields himself; whether it be the sinful dispositions of his heart, in actions which lead to death, or the new and spiritual obedience implanted by regeneration. The apostle rejoiced now they obeyed from the heart the gospel, into which they were delivered as into a mould. As the same metal becomes a new vessel, when melted and recast in another mould, so the believer has become a new creature. And there is great difference in the liberty of mind and spirit, so opposite to the state of slavery, which the true Christian has in the service of his rightful Lord, whom he is enabled to consider as his Father, and himself as his son and heir, by the adoption of grace. The dominion of sin consists in being willingly slaves thereto, not in being harassed by it as a hated power, struggling for victory. Those who now are the servants of God, once were the slaves of sin.</body></html>
