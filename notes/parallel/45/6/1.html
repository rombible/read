If the increase of sin has only led to a larger measure of forgiveness it might be thought well to continue in sin, and so to enhance the measure and glory of forgiving grace. But to the Christian this is impossible. In regard to sin he is, in theory and principle, dead. When he was converted from heathenism and received Christian baptism he gave himself up unreservedly to Christ; he professed adhesion to Christ, and especially to His death; he pledged himself to adopt that death as his own; he entered into fellowship with it in order that he might also enjoy the fellowship of the resurrection of Christ. This fellowship or participation is both physical and ethical.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Shall we continue in sin?</span>--Again the Apostle is drawn into one of those subtle casuistical questions that had such a great attraction for him. But he soon returns to the root-ideas of his own system. In previous chapters he had dealt with one of the two great root-ideas, justification by faith; he now passes to the second, union with Christ. The one might be described as the <span class= "ital">juridical,</span> the other as the <span class= "ital">mystical,</span> theory of salvation. The connecting-link which unites them is faith. Faith in Christ, and especially in the death of Christ, is the instrument of justification. Carried a degree further. it involves an actual identification with the Redeemer Himself. This, no doubt, is mystical language. When strictly compared with the facts of the religious consciousness, it must be admitted that all such terms as union, oneness, fellowship, identification, pass into the domain of metaphor. They are taken to express the highest conceivable degree of attachment and devotion. In this sense they are now consecrated by the use of centuries, and any other phrases substituted for them, though gaining perhaps somewhat in precision, would only seem poor and cold. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus G: On the Doctrine of Union with Christ.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-8:39.</span> - (7) <span class="accented">Moral results to true believers of the revelation to them of the righteousness of God.</span> The <span class="accented">righteousness of God</span> having been announced as revealed in the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>), set forth as available for all mankind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-31</a>), shown to be in accordance with the teaching of the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm">Romans 4:1-25</a>), viewed with regard to the feelings and hopes of believers fell Romans 5:1-11) and to the position of the human race before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-21</a>), the necessary moral results of a true apprehension of the doctrine are treated in this section of the Epistle. And first is shown from various points of view - <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-7:6.</span> - (<span class="accented">a</span>) <span class="accented">The obligation believers of holiness of life.</span> The subject is led up to by meeting certain <span class="accented">supposed</span> erroneous conclusions from what has been said in the preceding chapter. It might be said that, if where sin abounded grace did much more abound - if in the obedience of the one Christ all believers are justified - human sin must be a matter of indifference; it cannot nullify the free gift; nay, grace will be even the more enhanced, in that it abounds the more. The apostle rebuts such antinomian conclusions by showing that they imply a total misunderstanding of the doctrine which was supposed to justify them; for that our partaking in the righteousness of God in Christ means our actually partaking in it - our being influenced by it, loving it and following it, not merely our having it imputed to us while we remain aloof from it; that justifying faith in Christ means spiritual union with Christ, a dying with him to sin and a rising with him to a new life, in which sin shall no longer have dominion over us. He refers to our baptism as having this only meaning, and he enforces his argument by three illustrations: firstly, as aforesaid, that of dying and rising again, which is signified in baptism (vers. 1-14); secondly, that of service to a master (vers. 15-23); thirdly, that of the relation of a wife to a husband (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-16</a>). It will be seen, when we come to it, that the third of these illustrations is a carrying out of the same idea, though it is there <span class="accented">law</span>, and not <span class="accented">sin</span>, that we are said to be emancipated from. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall we say then?</span> So St. Paul introduces a difficulty or objection arising out of the preceding argument (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</span> Referring to the whole preceding argument, and especially to the concluding verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20, 21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1,2 The apostle is very full in pressing the necessity of holiness. He does not explain away the free grace of the gospel, but he shows that connexion between justification and holiness are inseparable. Let the thought be abhorred, of continuing in sin that grace may abound. True believers are dead to sin, therefore they ought not to follow it. No man can at the same time be both dead and alive. He is a fool who, desiring to be dead unto sin, thinks he may live in it.</body></html>
