"St. Paul regards this change--from sin to righteousness, from bondage to freedom, from death to life--as summed up in one definite act of the past; potentially to all men in our Lord's passion and resurrection, actually to each individual man when he accepts Christ, is baptised into Christ. Then he is made righteous by being incorporated into Christ's righteousness, he dies once for all to sin, he lives henceforth for ever to God. This is his <span class= "ital">ideal.</span> Practically, we know that the death to sin and the life to righteousness are inchoate, imperfect, gradual, meagerly realised even by the most saintly men in this life; but St. Paul sets the matter in this ideal light to force upon the consciences of his hearers the fact that an entire change came over them when they became Christians--that the knowledge and the grace then vouchsafed to them did not leave them where they were--that they are not, and cannot be, their former selves--and that it is a contradiction of their very being to sin any more. It is the definiteness, the absoluteness of this change, considered as an historical crisis, which forms the central idea of St. Paul's teaching, and which the aorist marks. We cannot, therefore, afford to obscure this idea by disregarding the distinctions of grammar; yet in our English version it is a mere chance whether in such cases the aorist is translated as an aorist" (<span class= "ital">On Revision,</span> p. 85). These remarks will form the best possible commentary upon the passage before us. It may be only well to add that the change between the position of the first Christians and our own involves a certain change in the application of what was originally said with reference to them. Baptism is not now the tremendous crisis that it was then. The ideal of Christian life then assumed is more distinctly an ideal. It has a much less definite hold upon the imagination and the will. But it ought not therefore to be any the less binding upon the Christian. He should work <span class= "ital">towards</span> it, if he cannot work <span class= "ital">from</span> it, in the spirit of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:12-14</a>.<p>It would be well for the reader to note at once the corrections suggested in the rendering of this verse by Dr. Lightfoot's criticism:--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>, "we <span class= "ital">were</span> buried" for "we are buried;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>, "the old man <span class= "ital">was</span> crucified" for "is crucified;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>, "if we <span class= "ital">died</span>" for "if we be dead."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God forbid!</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>: St. Paul's usual way of rejecting an idea indignantly). <span class="cmt_word">We who</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, with its proper meaning of <span class="accented">being such as</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>died</span> (not, as in the Authorized Version, "are dead."

He does not explain away the free grace of the gospel, but he shows that connexion between justification and holiness are inseparable. Let the thought be abhorred, of continuing in sin that grace may abound. True believers are dead to sin, therefore they ought not to follow it. No man can at the same time be both dead and alive. He is a fool who, desiring to be dead unto sin, thinks he may live in it.</body></html>
