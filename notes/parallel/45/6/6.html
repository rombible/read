The Christian's union with the crucified Christ binds him also to crucify or mortify (ascetically) the sinful desires of his body. Thus he is released from the dominion of those desires. But this is not all. Just as Christ passed from the cross to the resurrection, and overcame death once for all, exchanging for it a life wholly dependent upon God; so, too, His followers must consider themselves cut off irrevocably--as if by death itself--from sin, and living with a new life dedicated and devoted to God, through their participation in the death and life of Jesus Christ their Lord.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Our old man.</span>--"Our old self" (Vaughan), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9-10</a>.<p>The old self, or that congeries of evil habits acquired in the state of heathenism, was, ideally if not actually, mortified and killed in our baptism. This change was wrought by a power brought to bear upon the will through the contemplation of the crucifixion of Christ. Hence, instead of saying simply "mortified," the Apostle writes rather "crucified," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span> put to death, not in any way, but specially <span class= "ital">through the cross.</span><p><span class= "bld">That the body of sin might be destroyed.</span>--The "body of sin" is the body subject to sin, or that supplies sin with the material on which it works. This substratum of carnal and fleshly desire, the Apostle tells us, is to be ascetically chastened and disciplined until it ceases to be a source of sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing this</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">that our old man was</span> (not <span class="accented">is</span>, as in the Authorized Version) <span class="cmt_word">crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed</span> (or <span class="accented">abolished</span>, or <span class="accented">done away</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>that</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>henceforth we should not serve</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, expressing <span class="accented">bondage</span>, or <span class="accented">slavery</span>; and so throughout the chapter in the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, translated "servants") <span class="cmt_word">sin. For he that hath died is freed from sin</span>. The word "crucified" has, of course, reference to the mode of Christ's death into which we were baptized. It does not imply anything further (as some have supposed) as to the manner of our own spiritual dying, such as painfulness or lingering; it merely means that in his death our old man died (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>). The term "old man" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>. It denotes man's unregenerate self, when under sin and condemnation; the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being his regenerate self. It is, of course, a different conception from that of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>. In Ephesians and Colossians the old man is said to be <span class="accented">put away</span>, or <span class="accented">put off</span>, and the new one <span class="accented">put on, as</span> though they were two clothings, or investments, of his personality, determining its character. Here, by a bolder figure, they are viewed as an old self that had died and a new one that had come to life in its place (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The idea of a new man being born into a new life in baptism was already familiar to the Jews in their baptism of proselytes (see Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3.htm">John 3</a>.); and our Lord, discoursing to Nicodemus of the new birth, supposes him to understand the figure; but he teaches him that the change thus expressed should be no mere change of profession and habits of life, but a radical inward change, which could only be wrought by the regenerating Spirit. Such a change St. Paul teaches to be signified by Christian baptism; not only deliverance from condemnation through participation in the benefits of the death of Christ, but also the birth or creation of a new self corresponding to his risen body, which will not be, like the old self, under the thraldom of sin. "The body of sin" may be taken as meaning much the same as "our old man;" sin being conceived as embodied in our former selves, and so possessing them and keeping them in bondage. It certainly does not mean simply our bodies as distinct from our souls, so as to imply the idea that the former must be macerated that the latter may live. The asceticism inculcated elsewhere in the New Testament is in no contradiction to the ideal of <span class="accented">mens sana in corpore sano.</span> Our former sin-possessed and sin-dominated personality being now crucified with Christ, dead, and done away with, we are no longer, in our new personality, in slavery to sin, and are both bound and able to renounce it; "for he that hath died is freed [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, literally, 'is justified'] from sin." In Scotland, one who is executed is said to be <span class="accented">justified</span>, the idea apparently being that he has satisfied the claims of law. So here ' <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, be it observed, in ver. 6 introduces by the way the second figure under which, as above said, the apostle regards his subject, though it is not taken up till ver. 16. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:3-10 Baptism teaches the necessity of dying to sin, and being as it were buried from all ungodly and unholy pursuits, and of rising to walk with God in newness of life. Unholy professors may have had the outward sign of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they never passed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature, called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, is crucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derived from the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yet struggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin, whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, so that the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, and find happiness in his service.</body></html>
