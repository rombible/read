The construction in the Greek is peculiar, and may be accounted for in one of two ways. Either the phrase "being justified" may be taken as corresponding to "all them that believe" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>, the change of case being an irregularity suggested by the form of the sentence immediately preceding; or the construction may be considered to be regular, and the participle "being justified" would then be dependent upon the last finite verb: "they come short of the glory of God, and <span class= "ital">in that very state of destitution</span> are justified."<p><span class= "bld">Freely.</span>--Gratuitously, without exertion or merit on their part. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm" title="Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give.">Matthew 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm" title="And he said to me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.

And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely.">Revelation 22:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">By his grace.</span>--<span class= "ital">By His own grace.</span> The <span class= "ital">means</span> by which justification is wrought out is the death and atonement of Christ; its <span class= "ital">ulterior</span> cause is the grace of God, or free readmission into His favour, which He accords to man.<p><span class= "bld">Redemption.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">ransoming.</span> The notion of ransom contains in itself the triple idea of a bondage, a deliverance, and the payment of an equivalent as the means of that deliverance. The bondage is the state of sin and of guilt, with the expectation of punishment; the deliverance is the removal of this state, and the opening out, in its stead, of a prospect of eternal happiness and glory; the equivalent paid by Christ is the shedding of His own blood. This last is the pivot upon which the whole idea of redemption turned. It is therefore clear that the redemption of the sinner is an act wrought objectively, and, in the first instance, independently of any change of condition in him, though such a change is involved in the appropriation of the efficacy of that act to himself. It cannot be explained as a purely subjective process wrought in the sinner through the influence of Christ's death. The idea of dying and reviving with Christ, though a distinct aspect of the atonement, cannot be made to cover the whole of it. There is implied, not only a change in the recipient of the atonement, but also a change wrought without his co-operation in the relations between God and man. There is, if it may be so said, in the death of Christ something which determines the will of God, as well as something which acts upon the will of man. And the particular influence which is brought to bear upon the counsels of God is represented under the figure of a ransom or payment of an equivalent. This element is too essentially a part of the metaphor, and is too clearly established by other parallel metaphors, to be explained away; though what the terms "propitiation" and "equivalent" can mean, as applied to God, we do not know, and it perhaps does not become us too curiously to inquire.<p>The doctrine of the atonement thus stated is not peculiar to St. Paul, and did not originate with him. It is found also in the Synoptic Gospels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a> ( = <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>), "The Son of Man came to give His life a ransom for many," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>, "And for this cause He is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption (<span class= "ital">ransoming</span>) of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."

But <span class="accented">potential</span> justification only is implied; for the condition for appropriation is further intimated by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> following. The means whereby it becomes <span class="accented">objectively</span> possible is "the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." Here, as throughout St. Paul's Epistles, and in the New Testament generally, the doctrine of <span class="accented">atonement</span> being required for man's justification is undoubtedly taught, Christ being viewed as not only manifesting God's righteousness in his life, and reconciling believers through his influence on themselves, but as <span class="accented">effecting</span> such reconciliation by an atoning sacrifice. The word itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) here used may indeed sometimes denote <span class="accented">deliverance</span> only (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a>); but certainly, when used of the redemption of man by Christ, it implies <span class="accented">atonement</span> by the payment of a <span class="accented">ransom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; the ransom paid being said to be <span class="accented">himself</span>, or (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>) <span class="accented">his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. It does not follow that all conceptions of schools of theology as to how the atonement was efficacious for its purpose are correct or adequate. It must, from the very nature of the subject, remain to us a mystery. It may be enough for us to believe that whatever need the human conscience has ever felt of atonement for sin, whatever human want was expressed by world-wide rites of sacrifice, whatever especially was signified by the blood required for atonement in the Mosaic ritual, - all this is met and fulfilled for us in Christ's offering of himself, and that in him and through him we may now "come boldly to the throne of grace," having need of no other <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x2e;</span> 25 ("set forth," Authorized Version), may bear here its most usual classical sense of <span class="accented">exhibiting to view</span> ("ante omniam oculos possuit," Bengel); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the historical manifestation of the Redeemer. It may, however, mean "decreed," or "purposed" (cf. ch. 1:13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> seems best taken as a neuter adjective used substantively, there being no instance of its application in the masculine to a person. Its ordinary use in the LXX (as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>) is to designate the lid of the ark (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mercy-seat), the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (which is added <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-17.htm">Exodus 25:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-6.htm">Exodus 37:6</a>) being supposed to be always understood, though the usual designation is simply <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Hence most commentators, including the Greek Fathers generally, understood <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in this sense here, Christ being regarded as the antitype of the mercy-seat, as being the medium of atonement and approach to God. The main objection to this view is that it involves an awkward confusion of metaphors, it being difficult to regard him who was at once the Victim whose blood was offered, and the High Priest who offered his own blood, <span class="accented">at the</span> mercy-seat, as being also the Mercy-seat itself. (Thus, however, Theodoret explains: "The mercy-seat of old was itself <span class="accented">bloodless, being</span> without life, but it received the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice. But the Lord Christ and God is at once Mercy-seat, High Priest, and Lamb.") The difficulty is avoided if we take the word here in the sense of <span class="accented">propitiatory offering</span>, which in itself it will bear, a noun, such as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, being supposed to be (cf. 4 Maccabees 17:22; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 16. c. 7; Dio Chrys., 'Orat.,' 11:1). Whatever its exact meaning, it evidently denotes a true fulfilment in Christ of the atonement for sin undoubtedly signified by the type; as does further <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which follows. For a distinct enunciation of the significance of bleed under the ancient ritual, as reserved for and expressing atonement, see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>. The meaning of the whole sacrificial ritual is there expressed as being that the life of man being forfeit to Divine justice, blood, representing life, must be offered instead of his life for atonement. Hence, in pursuance of this idea, the frequent references in the New Testament to Hebrews physical <span class="accented">blood-shedding</span> of Christ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"). It is not, however, implied that the material blood of Christ, shed on the cross, in itself cleanses the soul from sin, but only that it signifies to us the fulfilment in him of the type of an atoning sacrifice. As to the construction of ver. 25, it is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is to be taken in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, meaning "through faith in his blood" (an unusual expression, though grammatically correct, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>), or with <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, such as apparently to signify "in his own blood," favours the latter connection (cf. <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-25</a>, where the offering of Christ is distinguished from those of the Law in being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). Thus the meaning will be that he was set forth (or purposed) as an <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, available for us through faith, and consisting in the offering of himself - in, the shedding of his own blood. <span class="cmt_word">For showing of his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime in the forbearance of God, in order to the showing of his righteousness in the time that now is, so that he may be righteous, and justifying</span> (the word is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> preceding) <span class="cmt_word">him that is of faith in Jesus</span>. This translation differs materially from that of the Authorized Version, which is evidently erroneous, especially in the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by "for the remission." Our translators, in a way very unusual with them, seem to have missed the drift of the passage, and so been led to give the above untenable rendering in order to suit their view of it. It is to be observed that two purposes of the <span class="accented">setting forth</span> (or <span class="accented">purposing</span>) of Christ Jesus as <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span> here declared, both denoted by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is repeated, being governed in the first clause of the sentence by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, and in the second by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>. Some say that the preposition is changed with no intended difference of meaning. But it is not St. Paul's way to use his prepositions carelessly. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> in the first clause may be taken to denote the immediate purpose of the propitiation, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the second to have its proper significance of <span class="accented">aim</span> or <span class="accented">direction</span>, denoting a further intention and result, consequent on the first. The first purpose, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, was the vindication of God's righteousness with regard to the ages past, in that he had so long <span class="accented">passed over</span>, or left unvisited, the sins of mankind. The propitiation of Christ. at length <span class="accented">set forth</span> (or, as may be expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, all along <span class="accented">purposed</span>), showed that he had not been indifferent to these sins, though <span class="accented">in his forbearance</span> he had passed them over. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>, where the death of Christ, as the Mediator of the new covenant, is said to have been "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant," the meaning and efficacy of the "death" being thus regarded, in the first place, as retrospective (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>). But then there was a further grand purpose, expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the second clause that of providing a way of present justification for believers now, without derogation of the Divine righteousness. Such appears to be the meaning of this passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:21-26 Must guilty man remain under wrath? Is the wound for ever incurable? No; blessed be God, there is another way laid open for us. This is the righteousness of God; righteousness of his ordaining, and providing, and accepting. It is by that faith which has Jesus Christ for its object; an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifying faith respects Christ as a Saviour, in all his three anointed offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King; trusting in him, accepting him, and cleaving to him: in all these, Jews and Gentiles are alike welcome to God through Christ. There is no difference, his righteousness is upon all that believe; not only offered to them, but put upon them as a crown, as a robe. It is free grace, mere mercy; there is nothing in us to deserve such favours. It comes freely unto us, but Christ bought it, and paid the price. And faith has special regard to the blood of Christ, as that which made the atonement. God, in all this, declares his righteousness. It is plain that he hates sin, when nothing less than the blood of Christ would satisfy for it. And it would not agree with his justice to demand the debt, when the Surety has paid it, and he has accepted that payment in full satisfaction.</body></html>
