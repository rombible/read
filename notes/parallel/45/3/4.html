Rather let God be seen to be true though all mankind should be proved false, even as the Psalmist looked upon his own sin as serving to enhance the triumph of God's justice. Speaking of that justice for the moment as if it could be arraigned before the bar of a still higher tribunal, he asserts its absolute and complete acquittal.<p><span class= "bld">That thou mightest be justified.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">in order that,</span> here as in the Hebrew of the Psalm. Good is, in some way inscrutable to us, educed out of evil, and this is clearly foreseen by God, and forms part of His design, though so as not to interfere with the free-will of man. Religion assumes that the two things, free-will and omnipotence, are reconcilable, though how they are to be reconciled seems an insoluble problem. The same difficulty attaches to every system but one of blank fatalism and atheism. But the theory of fatalism if logically carried out would simply destroy human society.<p>Psalms 51, in which the quotation occurs, is commonly (in accordance with the heading), though perhaps wrongly, ascribed to David after his sin with Bathsheba. The effect of this sin is to throw out into the strongest relief the justice of the sentence by which it is followed and punished. The original is, "That thou mightest be just in thy speaking; that thou mightest be pure in thy judging." St. Paul adopts the rendering of the LXX., who make the last word passive instead of active, thus making it apply, not to the sentence given by God, but to the imaginary trial to which by a figure of speech that sentence itself is supposed to be submitted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God forbid</span> (there is no better English phrase for expressing the indignant repudiation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">yea, let God be true</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let his truth be established;" "Fiat, in judicio," Bengel), <span class="cmt_word">but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged</span>, We can hardly avoid recognizing a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a> in "every man a liar, the words of the LXX. being exactly given, though the general purport of that psalm does not bear upon the present argument. The apostle takes this phrase from it as expressing well what he wants to say, viz. that though <span class="accented">all</span> men were false (in the sense expressed and implied by the previous <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), yet God's truth stands. But it only leads up to the second quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, which is the important one, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. In its final words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, the LXX. is followed (so also Vulgate, <span class="accented">cum</span> <span class="accented">judicaris</span>), though the Hebrew may be more correctly rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "be clear when thou judgest." The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the LXX. may be understood passively in the sense of God being called to account, as men might be, for the justice of his dealings; or, perhaps, in a middle sense for entering into a suit or controversy with his people. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "going to law" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1, 6</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-40.htm">Matthew 5:40</a>), and in the LXX., with especial reference to a supposed <span class="accented">controversy</span> or <span class="accented">pleading</span> of God with men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a>. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.) The meaning of this concluding expression does not, however, affect the main purport of the verse, or its relevancy as here quoted. Occurring in what is believed to be David's penitential psalm after his sin. in the matter of Uriah, it declares, in conjunction with the preceding verse, that, sin having been committed, man alone is guilty, and that God's truth and righteousness can never be impugned. But it seems to imply still more than this, viz. that man's sin has the establishment of God's righteousness as its consequence, or even, it may be, as its purpose; for the conclusion of ver. 4 in the psalm, naturally connected with "against thee only have I sinned" preceding, is so connected by <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> (in Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>); and it is not out of keeping with scriptural doctrine that David should have intended to express even Divine <span class="accented">purpose in</span> that he had been permitted, for his sins, to fall into that deeper sin <span class="accented">with the view of</span> establishing God's righteousness all the more. It does not, however, seem certain (whatever some grammarians may say) that the conjunction need of necessity be understood as <span class="accented">relic</span>; it may be <span class="accented">embatic</span> only. However this be, it is the inference from <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;</span> that suggests the new objection of the following verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The law could not save in or from sins, yet it gave the Jews advantages for obtaining salvation. Their stated ordinances, education in the knowledge of the true God and his service, and many favours shown to the children of Abraham, all were means of grace, and doubtless were made useful to the conversion of many. But especially the Scriptures were committed to them. Enjoyment of God's word and ordinances, is the chief happiness of a people. But God's promises are made only to believers; therefore the unbelief of some, or of many professors, cannot make this faithfulness of no effect. He will fulfil his promises to his people, and bring his threatened vengeance upon unbelievers. God's judging the world, should for ever silence all doubtings and reflections upon his justice. The wickedness and obstinate unbelief of the Jews, proved man's need of the righteousness of God by faith, and also his justice in punishing for sin. Let us do evil, that good may come, is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners; for few thus justify themselves in their wicked ways. The believer knows that duty belongs to him, and events to God; and that he must not commit any sin, or speak one falsehood, upon the hope, or even assurance, that God may thereby glorify himself. If any speak and act thus, their condemnation is just.</body></html>
