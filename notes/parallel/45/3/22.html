"Faith" in St. Paul's writings implies an intense attachment and devotion. It has an intellectual basis, necessarily involving a belief in the existence, and in certain attributes, of the Person for whom it is entertained; but it is moral in its operation, a recasting of the whole emotional nature in accordance with this belief, together with a consequent change in character and practice. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus B: On the Meaning of the word Faith.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">And upon all.</span>--These words are wanting in the best MSS., and should be omitted.<p><span class= "bld">For there is no difference.</span>--The righteousness that God gives is given to <span class= "ital">all</span> that believe, without any distinction of Jew or Gentile; for all equally need it, and it is free equally to all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ unto all</span> (<span class="accented">and upon all</span> is added in the Textus Receptus, but ill supported) <span class="cmt_word">them that believe: for there is no distinction.</span> We observe that the expression here used is not <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> but simply <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> does not naturally connect itself with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> as defining it, but rather with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> which follows, and perhaps with reference to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 21 understood. The idea, then, may be still that of God's own righteousness, manifested in Christ, <span class="accented">unto</span> or <span class="accented">towards</span> all believers, who through faith apprehended it and became sharers in it. When St. Paul elsewhere speaks of the believer's <span class="accented">imputed</span> righteousness, his language is different, so as to make his meaning plain.

Is the wound for ever incurable? No; blessed be God, there is another way laid open for us. This is the righteousness of God; righteousness of his ordaining, and providing, and accepting. It is by that faith which has Jesus Christ for its object; an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifying faith respects Christ as a Saviour, in all his three anointed offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King; trusting in him, accepting him, and cleaving to him: in all these, Jews and Gentiles are alike welcome to God through Christ. There is no difference, his righteousness is upon all that believe; not only offered to them, but put upon them as a crown, as a robe. It is free grace, mere mercy; there is nothing in us to deserve such favours. It comes freely unto us, but Christ bought it, and paid the price. And faith has special regard to the blood of Christ, as that which made the atonement. God, in all this, declares his righteousness. It is plain that he hates sin, when nothing less than the blood of Christ would satisfy for it. And it would not agree with his justice to demand the debt, when the Surety has paid it, and he has accepted that payment in full satisfaction.</body></html>
