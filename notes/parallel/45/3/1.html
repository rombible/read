He is about to answer the question fully, as he does later in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4-5</a>; but after stating the first point, he goes off upon a difficulty raised by this, and does not return to complete what he had begun. This, again, is characteristic of his ardent and keenly speculative mind. Problems such as those which he discusses evidently have a fascination for him, and lead him, here as elsewhere, at once to leave the immediate subject before him, and to enter eagerly into the discussion of them. A more lethargic or timid brain would be under no such temptation.<p>One real and solid advantage on the part of the Jew was that he was made the direct recipient of the divine revelation. This privilege of his is not annulled by the defection of a part of the people. It rests not upon the precarious fidelity of men, but upon the infallible promise of God. Yet is not the ultimate triumph of that promise any excuse for those who have set it at nought. They will be punished just the same, and rightly. Otherwise there could be no judgment at all. The casuistical objection that sin loses its guilt if it redounds to God's glory, or, in other words, that the end justifies the means, carries with it its own condemnation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - (2) <span class="accented">Certain objections with regard to the Jews suggested and met.</span> In this passage, before proceeding with his argument, the apostle meets certain objections that might be made to what has been so far said. Some difficulty in determining his exact meaning arises from the concise and pregnant form in which the objections are put and answered, and from fresh ones arising out of the answers, which have also to be met. The objections are from the Jewish standpoint, though not put into the mouth of an objecting Jew, but rather suggested as likely ones by St. Paul himself. To the original readers of the Epistle, who were familiar with the tone of Jewish thought, the sequence of the ideas would probably be more obvious than to us. Reserving special consideration of successive clauses for our exposition of each verse, we may, in the first place, exhibit thus the general drift. <span class="accented">Objection</span> 1 (ver. 1). If being a Jew, if circumcision itself, gives one no advantage over the Gentile, what was the use of the old covenant at all? It is thus shown to have been illusory; and God's own truth and faithfulness are impugned, if he is supposed to have given, as conveying advantages, what really conveyed none. (This last thought, though not expressed, must be supposed to be implied in the objection, since it is replied to in the answer.) <span class="accented">Answer</span> (vers. 2-4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was not illusory; it did convey great advantages in the way of <span class="accented">privilege and opportunity</span>; this advantage first, not to mention other. that "the oracles of God" were entrusted to the Jew. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if some (more or fewer, it matters not) have failed to realize these advantages, it has been their fault, not God's. It is man's unfaithfulness, not his, that has been the cause of the failure. Nay, though, according to the hasty saying of the psalmist, <span class="accented">all men</span> were false, God's truth remains; nay, further, as is expressed in another psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.), man's very unfaithfulness is found to commend his faithfulness the more, and redound to his greater glory. <span class="accented">Objection</span> 2 (ver. 5). Based on the last assertion. But if man's unfaithfulness has this result, how can God, consistently with his justice, be wrath with us and punish us for it? Surely the Jew (whose case we are now considering) may claim exemption from "the wrath" of God spoken of above, his unfaithfulness being allowed to have served only to establish God's truth and to enhance his glory. <span class="accented">Answer</span> (ver. 6-8). I have suggested this objection as though the matter could be regarded from a mere human point of view, as though it were one between man and man; for it is true that a man cannot justly take vengeance on another who has not really harmed him. But such a view is inapplicable to God in his dealings with man; it does not touch our doctrine of his righteous wrath against sin as such. I can only meet it with a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it would preclude God from judging the world at all, as we all believe he will do. Any <span class="accented">heathen</span> sinner might put in the same plea, saying, Why am I too (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>) judged as a sinner? Nay, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> since it involves the principle of sin being evil, not in itself, but only with regard to its consequences, it would, if carried out, justify the odious view (which we Christians are by some falsely accused of holding) that we may do evil that good may come. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What advantage then hath the Jew! or what is the profit of circumcision! Much</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;</span>, a neuter adjective, agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">every way</span> (not <span class="accented">by all means</span>; the meaning is that in all respects the position of the Jew is an advantageous one): <span class="cmt_word">first</span> (rather than <span class="accented">chiefly</span>, as in the Authorized Version. One point of advantage is specified, which might have been followed by a <span class="accented">secondly</span> and a <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, etc. But the writer stops here, the mention of this <span class="accented">first</span> being sufficient for his purpose. Others are enumerated, so as to elucidate the purport of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in ch. 9:4, 5) <span class="cmt_word">for that they</span> (the Jews) <span class="cmt_word">were entrusted with the oracles of God</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (always used in the plural in the New Testament) occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>. Of these passages the most apposite is <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>, where the Divine communications to Moses on Mount Sinai are spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16</a>, where Balaam speaks of himself as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). Some (as Meyer), in view of the supposed, reference in the following verse to the Jews rejection of the gospel, take the word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> here to mean especially the revealed promises of the Redeemer. But neither the word itself nor its use elsewhere suggests any such limited meaning; nor does the context really require it. It may denote generally the Divine revelations of the Old Testament, which, for the eventual benefit of mankind, had been entrusted exclusively to the Jews. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The law could not save in or from sins, yet it gave the Jews advantages for obtaining salvation. Their stated ordinances, education in the knowledge of the true God and his service, and many favours shown to the children of Abraham, all were means of grace, and doubtless were made useful to the conversion of many. But especially the Scriptures were committed to them. Enjoyment of God's word and ordinances, is the chief happiness of a people. But God's promises are made only to believers; therefore the unbelief of some, or of many professors, cannot make this faithfulness of no effect. He will fulfil his promises to his people, and bring his threatened vengeance upon unbelievers. God's judging the world, should for ever silence all doubtings and reflections upon his justice. The wickedness and obstinate unbelief of the Jews, proved man's need of the righteousness of God by faith, and also his justice in punishing for sin. Let us do evil, that good may come, is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners; for few thus justify themselves in their wicked ways. The believer knows that duty belongs to him, and events to God; and that he must not commit any sin, or speak one falsehood, upon the hope, or even assurance, that God may thereby glorify himself. If any speak and act thus, their condemnation is just.</body></html>
