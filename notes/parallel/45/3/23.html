But, even apart from the different, and in itself more obvious, meaning of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, where it occurs elsewhere, it is at least a question whether in the last cited passage it can be taken to mean praise or honour <span class="accented">from</span> God. It comes immediately after the quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>, etc., followed by "These things said Esaias, when he saw <span class="accented">his glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), and spoke of him." Hence the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a> may probably be that the persons spoken of loved <span class="accented">mundane</span> glory (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-29.htm">Matthew 6:29</a>) rather than the <span class="accented">Divine</span> glory, seen in the vision of faith, manifested to the world in Christ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We beheld his glory," etc.), and "loved" by those who have not the eyes blinded and the heart hardened. So, even in the previous passage of St. John's Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-41.htm">John 5:41, 44</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> may denote man's participation in the Divine glory, rather than praise or honour, while <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may mean the mundane glory conferred by men on each other. These considerations commend, in the passage before us, the interpretation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Significatur ipsius Dei viventis gloria, <span class="accented">vitam</span> tribuens (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>); ad quam homini, si non peccasset, patuit aditus: sod peccator ab illo fine sue excidit, neque jam eum assequitur, neque gloriam illam, quae in illo effulsisset, ullo mode tolerare potest: <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-20.htm">Hebrews 12:20</a>, et <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>; quo fit ut morti sit obnoxius: nam gloria et immortalitas suut synonyma, et sic mors et corruptio. <span class="accented">Absunt a gloria Dei, i.e.</span> a summo fine homiuis aberrarunt. At justificati recuporant spom illius glorise. Vid. omnino c. 5:2, 11, 17; 8:30, etc." (Bengel). Further, the sense which the same expression seems evidently to bear in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a> of this Epistle is of importance for our determination of its meaning here. We are not justified in understanding, with some interpreters, any specific reference to the "image of God" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in which man was created, and which has been lost by the Fall, there being nothing to suggest it, or, with others, <span class="accented">exclusively</span> to the future glory, since the present <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> seems to denote a present deficiency. The general conception appears sufficiently plain in Bengel's exposition above given, according to which "the glory of God" means the glory of the Divine righteousness ("sempiterna ejus virtus et divinitas" Bengel on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>), which man, through sin, falls short of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:21-26 Must guilty man remain under wrath? Is the wound for ever incurable? No; blessed be God, there is another way laid open for us. This is the righteousness of God; righteousness of his ordaining, and providing, and accepting. It is by that faith which has Jesus Christ for its object; an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifying faith respects Christ as a Saviour, in all his three anointed offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King; trusting in him, accepting him, and cleaving to him: in all these, Jews and Gentiles are alike welcome to God through Christ. There is no difference, his righteousness is upon all that believe; not only offered to them, but put upon them as a crown, as a robe. It is free grace, mere mercy; there is nothing in us to deserve such favours. It comes freely unto us, but Christ bought it, and paid the price. And faith has special regard to the blood of Christ, as that which made the atonement. God, in all this, declares his righteousness. It is plain that he hates sin, when nothing less than the blood of Christ would satisfy for it. And it would not agree with his justice to demand the debt, when the Surety has paid it, and he has accepted that payment in full satisfaction.</body></html>
