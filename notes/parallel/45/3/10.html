They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>. or Psalms 53.). <span class="cmt_word">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they hays used deceit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>); <span class="cmt_word">the poison of asps is under their lips</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-3.htm">Psalm 140:3</a>): <span class="cmt_word">whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-7.htm">Psalm 10:7</a>): <span class="cmt_word">their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways: and the way of peace have they not known</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-16.htm">Proverbs 1:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>): <span class="cmt_word">there is no fear of God before their eyes</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-1.htm">Psalm 36:1</a>). These texts are from various unconnected passages of the Old Testament, quoted from the LXX., though not all accurately. They seem to be put together from memory by way of showing the general scriptural view of human depravity. It may be said that they do not establish the apostle's position of <span class="accented">all</span> men being guilty; for that they are for the most part rhetorical rather than dogmatic, that most of them refer only to certain classes of men, and that the righteous are spoken of too, and this in the sequence of even the most sweeping of them all (that from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>. or Psalms 53.), which does, literally understood, assert universal sinfulness. Any such objection to the cogency of the quotations may be met by regarding them as adduced, not as rigid proofs, but as only generally confirmatory of the apostle's position. See, he would say to the Jew, the picture your own Scriptures give you; observe their continued testimony to human depravity: and the main point of all the quotations is that which is brought out in the next verse, viz. that they had reference, not to the Gentile world, but to the chosen people themselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-18 Here again is shown that all mankind are under the guilt of sin, as a burden; and under the government and dominion of sin, as enslaved to it, to work wickedness. This is made plain by several passages of Scripture from the Old Testament, which describe the corrupt and depraved state of all men, till grace restrain or change them. Great as our advantages are, these texts describe multitudes who call themselves Christians. Their principles and conduct prove that there is no fear of God before their eyes. And where no fear of God is, no good is to be looked for.</body></html>
