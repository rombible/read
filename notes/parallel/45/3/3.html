Or we may take the first two words by themselves, and throw the next two clauses together. How stands the case? If some rejected the faith, shall their rejection make void or defeat the faithfulness of God?<p>The Apostle considers an objection that might be brought against his argument that the divine revelation vouchsafed to them was a special privilege of the Jewish people. It might be said that they had forfeited and cancelled this privilege by their unbelief. He first reduces the objection to its proper limits; it was not <span class= "ital">all,</span> but <span class= "ital">some,</span> who were unbelievers. But granting that there were some who did not believe this fact would have no power to shake the eternal promises of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what if some</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. The expression does net denote whether many or few; it only avoids assertion of universality of unbelief (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7</a>), though it is implied in the following verso that, even if it had been universal, the argument would stand) <span class="cmt_word">did not believe?</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</span> Alford renders <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> "were unfaithful," taking it in the sense of being "unfaithful to the covenant, the very condition of which was to walk in the ways of the Lord, and observe his statutes;" and this on the ground that the apostle is not as yet speaking of faith or the want of it, but, in accordance with the idea of the preceding chapter, of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 5) and moral guilt. But the meaning of words must not be forced to meet the views of interpreters; and we observe that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are ever elsewhere used in their proper sense to denote want of <span class="accented">faith</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-11.htm">Mark 16:11, 14, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>, 41; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>). Still, it is to be observed that in the passage before us <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in man is opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in God, so as to suggest a more general sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> than mere <span class="accented">unbelief.</span> In view of this opposition, we may adopt the rendering of the whole passage in the Revised Version: "What if some were without faith? Shall their want of faith," etc.? Meyer and others, understanding (as said above) by <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> the Divine oracles which were prophetic of Christ, refer <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> exclusively to the disbelief in him on the part of the majority of the Jews at the time of writing. But the aorist tense of the verb, as well as the context, is against the idea of such reference, at any rate exclusively. The context, both in ch. 2. and the latter part of this chapter after ver. 9, certainly suggests rather reference to the failure of the Jews throughout their history to realize the advantage of their privileged position; and this failure might properly be attributed to their want of faith, to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm">Hebrews 4:2</a>, together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in these passages is regarded as the root of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. On the other hand, the whole drift of ch. 11. in this Epistle - where the <span class="accented">present</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the chosen people shown in their rejection of the gospel is spoken of as not hindering, but furthering, the righteous purpose of God, and redounding in the end to his glory - suggests a like reference here. And it may have been in the apostle's mind, though, for the reasons above given, it can hardly be the only one in the passage before us. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The law could not save in or from sins, yet it gave the Jews advantages for obtaining salvation. Their stated ordinances, education in the knowledge of the true God and his service, and many favours shown to the children of Abraham, all were means of grace, and doubtless were made useful to the conversion of many. But especially the Scriptures were committed to them. Enjoyment of God's word and ordinances, is the chief happiness of a people. But God's promises are made only to believers; therefore the unbelief of some, or of many professors, cannot make this faithfulness of no effect. He will fulfil his promises to his people, and bring his threatened vengeance upon unbelievers. God's judging the world, should for ever silence all doubtings and reflections upon his justice. The wickedness and obstinate unbelief of the Jews, proved man's need of the righteousness of God by faith, and also his justice in punishing for sin. Let us do evil, that good may come, is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners; for few thus justify themselves in their wicked ways. The believer knows that duty belongs to him, and events to God; and that he must not commit any sin, or speak one falsehood, upon the hope, or even assurance, that God may thereby glorify himself. If any speak and act thus, their condemnation is just.</body></html>
