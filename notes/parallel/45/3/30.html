In like manner there is no essential difference indicated by the fact that the first noun has not the article, while the second has it. The former is more abstract--the quality of faith in man; the latter more concrete--faith as embodied in the gospel. The two prepositions, "by" and "through," are in English nearly convertible, or differ from each other no more than "instrument" and "means."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If indeed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, as in the Textus Receptus) <span class="cmt_word">God is one, who shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith</span>. Here the <span class="accented">unity</span> of God is given as the reason of his being the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews. So also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is the reason why he wills all men to be saved. It is of importance to grasp St. Paul's idea in his assertions of the <span class="accented">unity</span> of God. It is not that of <span class="accented">numerical</span> unity, but what may be called the unity of <span class="accented">quality</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not a mere assertion of monotheism as against polytheism, but that the one God is one and the same to all, comprehending all in the embrace of his own essential unity. God's unity involved in St. Paul's mind the idea of "One God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>); "who made of one blood every nation of men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>); in whom we (all of us) "live and move and have our being" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>). Thus exclusion of the Gentiles from the paternal embrace of the one God is incompatible with the very idea, so conceived, of his unity. In the latter part of this verse it is said that God will justify the circumcision <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the uncircumcision <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, the preposition being changed, and the second <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> being preceded by the article. The difference is not of essential importance, "faith" being the emphatic word. But it is not unmeaning. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;</span> expresses the principle of justification; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, the medium through which it may be had. The Jew was already in a position for justification through the Law leading up to Christ. He had only to accept it as <span class="accented">of faith</span>, and not <span class="accented">of works of law</span> (ver. 20). The Gentile must attain to it <span class="accented">through faith</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his faith in the gospel now revealed to him. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (Theodorus). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-31 God will have the great work of the justification and salvation of sinners carried on from first to last, so as to shut out boasting. Now, if we were saved by our own works, boasting would not be excluded. But the way of justification by faith for ever shuts out boasting. Yet believers are not left to be lawless; faith is a law, it is a working grace, wherever it is in truth. By faith, not in this matter an act of obedience, or a good work, but forming the relation between Christ and the sinner, which renders it proper that the believer should be pardoned and justified for the sake of the Saviour, and that the unbeliever who is not thus united or related to him, should remain under condemnation. The law is still of use to convince us of what is past, and to direct us for the future. Though we cannot be saved by it as a covenant, yet we own and submit to it, as a rule in the hand of the Mediator.</body></html>
