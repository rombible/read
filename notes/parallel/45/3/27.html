How does it affect the pretensions of the Jew? It shuts them out by laying stress no longer on works, which were the proper fulfilment of the first law as it stood, but upon faith. Faith is the true medium of justification. And faith belongs as much to Gentile as to Jew. For faith is the appointed means by which all mankind will be justified; and they will all be justified before the same tribunal, whether they be circumcised or not. Still this involves no abrogation of the Law, but rather a confirmation of it.<p>(27) <span class= "bld">It is excluded.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">It was excluded</span>--at the moment when the law of faith--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the gospel--was brought in.<p><span class= "bld">By what law?</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">By what kind of law?</span> Is this law which gets rid of boasting one which calls for works; or is it one that calls for faith?<p><span class= "bld">The law of faith.</span>--Another name for the gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where then is the boasting?</span> (that of the Jew, referred to in ch. 2, of his superiority to the Gentile with regard to justification). It is excluded. By what manner of (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) law? Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. Is it, then, here implied that the law of works would allow of boasting? Not so <span class="accented">practically.</span> But its <span class="accented">theory</span> would leave room for it, on the supposition of its conditions being fulfilled; it is a <span class="accented">kind</span> of law (observe <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>;) which does not exclude it; for if a man could say, "I have fulfilled all the righteousness of the Law," he would have something wherein to glory. But the <span class="accented">principle</span> of the law of faith, which has been shown to be the only one available for the justification of either Jew or Gentile, in itself excludes it. It will be observed that the strict sense of the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, hitherto preserved, is extended in <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. (For the various applications of which the word is capable, see especially ch. 7.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-31 God will have the great work of the justification and salvation of sinners carried on from first to last, so as to shut out boasting. Now, if we were saved by our own works, boasting would not be excluded. But the way of justification by faith for ever shuts out boasting. Yet believers are not left to be lawless; faith is a law, it is a working grace, wherever it is in truth. By faith, not in this matter an act of obedience, or a good work, but forming the relation between Christ and the sinner, which renders it proper that the believer should be pardoned and justified for the sake of the Saviour, and that the unbeliever who is not thus united or related to him, should remain under condemnation. The law is still of use to convince us of what is past, and to direct us for the future. Though we cannot be saved by it as a covenant, yet we own and submit to it, as a rule in the hand of the Mediator.</body></html>
