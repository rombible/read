It also affords an example of the corruptions in the text of the Old Testament to which this practice gave rise. The whole passage as it stands here is found in some manuscripts of the LXX. as part of Psalms 14, whence it has been copied not only into the Vulgate but also our own Prayer Book, which will be seen to differ from the Bible version.<p>The quotations have different degrees of appositeness, so far as they may be considered in the modern sense as probative rather than illustrative. The first, from Psalms 14, is couched in such general terms as to be directly in point; the second and third, from Psalms 5, 140, are aimed specially against the oppressors of the Psalmist; and so, too, the fourth, from Psalms 10, but in a more general and abstract form; that from Isaiah indicates the moral degradation among the prophet's contemporaries that had led to the Captivity; while the last, from Psalms 36, is an expression applied, not to all men, but particularly to the wicked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-20.</span> - (3) <span class="accented">The testimony of the Old Testament to human sinfulness.</span> Objections having been thus raised and met, the apostle now confirms his position, that all mankind, Jew as well as Gentile, are under sin, by adducing the Scriptures of the Jews themselves. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved</span> (or, <span class="accented">charged</span>, as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">causati sumus</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin.</span> The meaning of the first part of this verse has been much discussed. We may observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> seems to be rightly separated (as in Authorized Version) from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> because of the form of the answer to the question, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>: after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>; we should expect <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Jews, with whom St. Paul identifies himself, must be supposed to put the question; not the Gentiles, as some have supposed. For there is nothing in the context to suggest the Gentiles as the speakers, nor does what follow suit the supposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The main question is as to the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, which occurs here only in the New Testament, and has, therefore, to be interpreted from consideration of the sense of which the verb is capable, and the probable drift of the argument. Some have taken it as a passive verb, with the meaning, "Are we surpassed?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are we Jews in <span class="accented">worse</span> case than the Gentiles on account of our greater privileges? The active verb, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of "to excel," being both transitive and intransitive, its passive may be used in the same sense. An instance quoted in commentaries is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Plut., 'Mor.,'), "cum Jove minores non sint." So the recent Revisers, though dissented from by the American Committee. The strong objection to this interpretation is that there has been nothing so far even to suggest any <span class="accented">superiority</span> of the Gentile to the Jew, and that what follows does not bear upon any such idea. Thus to interpret would be to sacrifice the sense to supposed grammatical exigence, which, after all, is uncertain. Taking, then, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> as the middle voice, we have two interpretations before us; either, with Meyer, to render, <span class="accented">Do we put forward</span> (anything) <span class="accented">in our defence? - which</span> he maintains (though not conclusively) to be the only proper sense of the middle verb - or (as in the Authorized Version), <span class="accented">Are we</span> better (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in better ease) <span class="accented">than they?</span> This rendering, though it gives essentially the same sense as if <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (intransitive) had been written, is commended by its suitableness to the course of argument, and the middle voice may, perhaps, he accounted for as denoting the Jews' supposed claim of superiority for themselves. Thus the connection of thought is plain. The conclusion of ch. 2. had left the Jews on the same footing with the Gentiles before God in respect of sinfulness. But then objections had been raised on the ground of the acknowledged privileges of the chosen people; and such objections have been met. The apostle now sums up the result: What, then, is the state of the case? Have we any advantage to allege? No, not at all in the sense intended; the previous argument stands; and he proceeds to confine his position from the testimony of the Old Testament itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-18 Here again is shown that all mankind are under the guilt of sin, as a burden; and under the government and dominion of sin, as enslaved to it, to work wickedness. This is made plain by several passages of Scripture from the Old Testament, which describe the corrupt and depraved state of all men, till grace restrain or change them. Great as our advantages are, these texts describe multitudes who call themselves Christians. Their principles and conduct prove that there is no fear of God before their eyes. And where no fear of God is, no good is to be looked for.</body></html>
