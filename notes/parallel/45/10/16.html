Just as Isaiah had said.<p>The argument does not run quite smoothly. The Apostle has two thoughts in his mind: (1) the necessity that the gospel should be preached before it could be believed; (2) the fact that, although it was preached (and accepted by many among the Gentiles), it was not accepted by the Jews.

This means, apparently, that in the prophet's representation of the proclamation of the good tidings all were said to hear, but not all to hearken, <span class="cmt_word">For Esaias saith, Lord, who Believed our report?</span> (The Greek word here is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span>, the same as in ver. 17, there rendered "hearing," and corresponding to the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> vers. 14,18.) <span class="cmt_word">So then faith cometh of hearing, and hearing by the Word of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, God's own Word, committed to, and spoken by, preachers duly sent). <span class="cmt_word">But I say, Did they not hear?.</span> The previous aorist, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, in ver. 16 having been understood as referring to the prophetic representations rather than to present known facts, the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> here must, for consistency, be similarly understood, though with a view also to the actual universality of the gospel message. The unexpressed nominative to <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> appears from the context to be men in general, not the Jews in particular.

The "sound" and the "words" in the psalm are those of the heavens and the firmament. But in the second part of the psalm, beginning at ver. 7, the psalmist passes from God's revelation of himself in nature to his revelation of himself in his Word. Still the psalm itself cannot well be understood as intimating the universal proclamation of the gospel. Nor is it necessary to suppose that St. Paul so understood it. Enough for him that the words he quotes express admirably what he desires to say. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-17 There is not one God to the Jews, more kind, and another to the Gentiles, who is less kind; the Lord is a Father to all men. The promise is the same to all, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, as God manifest in the flesh. All believers thus call upon the Lord Jesus, and none else will do so humbly or sincerely. But how should any call on the Lord Jesus, the Divine Saviour, who had not heard of him? And what is the life of a Christian but a life of prayer? It shows that we feel our dependence on him, and are ready to give up ourselves to him, and have a believing expectation of our all from him. It was necessary that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles. Somebody must show them what they are to believe. How welcome the gospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached! The gospel is given, not only to be known and believed, but to be obeyed. It is not a system of notions, but a rule of practice. The beginning, progress, and strength of faith is by hearing. But it is only hearing the word, as the word of God that will strengthen faith.</body></html>
