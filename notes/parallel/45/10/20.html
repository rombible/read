The peculiar <span class="accented">boldness</span> of Isaiah's utterance consists in this - that, at a time when Israel was recognized as God's one chosen people, he is said to make himself known even to those who sought him not at all. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:18-21 Did not the Jews know that the Gentiles were to be called in? They might have known it from Moses and Isaiah. Isaiah speaks plainly of the grace and favour of God, as going before in the receiving of the Gentiles. Was not this our own case? Did not God begin in love, and make himself known to us when we did not ask after him? The patience of God towards provoking sinners is wonderful. The time of God's patience is called a day, light as day, and fit for work and business; but limited as a day, and there is a night at the end of it. God's patience makes man's disobedience worse, and renders that the more sinful. We may wonder at the mercy of God, that his goodness is not overcome by man's badness; we may wonder at the wickedness of man, that his badness is not overcome by God's goodness. And it is a matter of joy to think that God has sent the message of grace to so many millions, by the wide spread of his gospel.</body></html>
