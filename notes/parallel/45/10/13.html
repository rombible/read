The text from Joel is in a passage which is distinctly Messianic; the same that is quoted by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-16.htm">Acts 2:16</a>) as fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost. Hence, and from the fact of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> being emphatic in the original, it is well quoted by the apostle as supplementing the previous one from Isaiah, and as conclusive for his argument. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-17 There is not one God to the Jews, more kind, and another to the Gentiles, who is less kind; the Lord is a Father to all men. The promise is the same to all, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, as God manifest in the flesh. All believers thus call upon the Lord Jesus, and none else will do so humbly or sincerely. But how should any call on the Lord Jesus, the Divine Saviour, who had not heard of him? And what is the life of a Christian but a life of prayer? It shows that we feel our dependence on him, and are ready to give up ourselves to him, and have a believing expectation of our all from him. It was necessary that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles. Somebody must show them what they are to believe. How welcome the gospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached! The gospel is given, not only to be known and believed, but to be obeyed. It is not a system of notions, but a rule of practice. The beginning, progress, and strength of faith is by hearing. But it is only hearing the word, as the word of God that will strengthen faith.</body></html>
