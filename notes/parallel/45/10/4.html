This last seems best to suit the line of thought in this place. The Jews evinced <span class="accented">ignorance, i.e.</span> of the real meaning and purpose of Law, in resting on it for justification. This is St. Paul's constant position in speaking of the office of Law - that it could not and was never meant to justify, but rather to convince of sin; to establish the need of, and excite a craving for, redemption; and so prepare men to appreciate and accept the righteousness of God in Christ which was its <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see especially ch. 7; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f6d;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>).<span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being here anarthrous, we translate it according to the rule observed in this Commentary. The apostle has, indeed, in view the Mosaic Law; but it is the principle of law, as such, that he is speaking cf. He next proceeds, as elsewhere throughout the Epistle, to quote from the Old Testament in illustration of the contrast between the two principles of justification, and this with the intention of showing that even in the Pentateuch that of justification by faith was intimated, and thus that it was all along the real <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Law. "Nam si prophetas suae sententiae testes citasset, haerebat tamen hic scrupulus, cum Lex aliam justitiae formam praescriberet. Hunc ergo optime discutit, quum ex ipsa Legis doctrina stabitit fidei justitiam" (Calvin). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-4 The Jews built on a false foundation, and refused to come to Christ for free salvation by faith, and numbers in every age do the same in various ways. The strictness of the law showed men their need of salvation by grace, through faith. And the ceremonies shadowed forth Christ as fulfilling the righteousness, and bearing the curse of the law. So that even under the law, all who were justified before God, obtained that blessing by faith, whereby they were made partakers of the perfect righteousness of the promised Redeemer. The law is not destroyed, nor the intention of the Lawgiver disappointed; but full satisfaction being made by the death of Christ for our breach of the law, the end is gained. That is, Christ has fulfilled the whole law, therefore whoever believeth in him, is counted just before God, as much as though he had fulfilled the whole law himself. Sinners never could go on in vain fancies of their own righteousness, if they knew the justice of God as a Governor, or his righteousness as a Saviour.</body></html>
