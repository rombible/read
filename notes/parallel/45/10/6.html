It referred to that very law which the Apostle is depreciating. Moses had described the <span class= "ital">Law</span> as something quite easy and accessible; but history had shown that, especially in the development in which the Law was known to the Apostle, the words were really much more applicable to his doctrine of a righteousness which was based upon faith. He therefore regards them as spoken allegorically and typically with reference to this.<p><span class= "bld">The righteousness which is of faith speaketh.</span>--This faith-righteousness is personified as if it were speaking itself, because the language used is applicable to it.<p><span class= "bld">That is, to bring Christ down from above.</span>--The Apostle adds these interpretations so as to give a specially Christian meaning to the words of Moses. All that these had meant was that the Law was not remote either in one direction or in another. The Apostle in the phrase "ascend into heaven" sees at once an allusion to the ascended Saviour, and he interprets it as if it implied that the Christian must ascend up to Him, or; what comes to the same thing, as if He must be brought down to the Christian. In like manner, when mention is made of descending into the abyss, he sees here an allusion to the descent of Christ into Hades. Again, he repudiates the idea that the Christian is compelled to join Him there in literal bodily presence. A far easier and simpler thing is the faith of the gospel. All the Christian has to do is to listen to it when it is preached, and then to confess his own adhesion to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart</span> (in the original, <span class="accented">It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>Who shall ascend into heaven?</span> <span class="cmt_word">(that is, to bring Christ down).</span> The parenthesis is St. Paul's own; the original has, after "heaven," <span class="accented">and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it? <span class="cmt_word"></span>Or, Who shall descend into the deep?</span> <span class="cmt_word">(that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead).</span> Again the parenthesis is St. Paul's; and he has substituted "into the deep" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">for</span> " <span class="accented">beyond the sea."</span> The original <span class="accented">is, Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? <span class="cmt_word"></span>But what saith it?

For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation</span>. The apostle's purpose in varying from the original is obvious from his interposed comments, and from the application that follows. It seems to be as though he had said, "See how, with a slight alteration, the passage in Deuteronomy becomes an exact description of our Christian doctrine." The most marked alteration is the substitution of "into the deep" for "beyond the sea." The "sea" in the original, to which the term "abyss" is applicable (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-14.htm">Job 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>), may have suggested the word; but St. Paul here evidently means by it the regions of the dead, imagined as subterranean, equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">Sheol</span>, and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. For use of the word in this sense, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a> (which may have been present to his mind), <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1, 2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1, 3</a>; in which passages <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> seems to denote the penal abode, corresponding to the Greek idea of Tartarus; but the word itself does not contain this idea, which is by no means intimated here. It may be taken to denote <span class="accented">Hades</span>, into which Christ "descended." Some commentators suppose the previous expression, "ascend into heaven to bring Christ down," to mean bringing him back to earth from heaven, whither he has ascended now. But the mere fact of its coming first, as well as the general sense of the passage, shows it to refer rather to the Incarnation, and what follows to the Resurrection. These were the two grand stages in the great work of redemption; both were required that "the righteousness which is of faith" might effectually be brought "nigh unto us." The impossible task of effecting either was not required of man; God has done both for us, and we have but to "believe in our hearts," that "the word" of his grace may be nigh us, in our mouth and in our heart, that we may do it. Thus all that was intimated or foreshadowed by that old passage in Deuteronomy is in its fullest sense to us fulfilled. (It may be observed, in passing, that the application to the Incarnation of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, etc., is, if correct, one of the instances of St. Paul's recognition of the Divine pre-existence of our Lord.) In ver. 9 the applicability of the words, "in thy mouth, and in thine heart," to the gospel dispensation is shown; the two expressions, properly understood, denoting all that is required of us. Confession of the Lord Jesus with the mouth must be taken to express generally, not only fearless avowal of the Christian faith, but also consistent life, according to the full meaning of our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-26.htm">Luke 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8</a>, etc. Confession of the Lord Jesus with the mouth, too, would have a peculiar significance then, when Christians were often so sorely tempted to deny him under persecution (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>). We may observe also how "the mouth" is elsewhere regarded as the index of the heart; as the main bodily organ whereby character is evinced and expressed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>, etc.). Further, the belief spoken of is <span class="accented">belief in the heart -</span> a living operative faith, not intellectual conviction only. Nor is belief that God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead to be taken as meaning belief of this one article of the Creed alone; it carries with it belief in the gospel generally, the doctrine of the Resurrection being here, as elsewhere, regarded as the central doctrine on which all the rest depends (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm">1 Corinthians 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>). "Haec summa Evangelii est. Nam, cum credimus Christum excitatum esse e mortuis, credimus sum pro peccatis satisfecisse, et in coelis regnare, ut nos ad imaginem suam perficiat" (Bucer). In ver. 10, where the offices of the heart and of the mouth are denoted in general terms, the distinction between "unto righteousness" with respect to the one, and "unto salvation" with respect to the other, is significant. By faith alone we are justified; but by confession in actual life, which is the fruit of faith, our salvation is secured. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:5-11 The self-condemned sinner need not perplex himself how this righteousness may be found. When we speak of looking upon Christ, and receiving, and feeding upon him, it is not Christ in heaven, nor Christ in the deep, that we mean; but Christ in the promise, Christ offered in the word. Justification by faith in Christ is a plain doctrine. It is brought before the mind and heart of every one, thus leaving him without excuse for unbelief. If a man confessed faith in Jesus, as the Lord and Saviour of lost sinners, and really believed in his heart that God had raised him from the dead, thus showing that he had accepted the atonement, he should be saved by the righteousness of Christ, imputed to him through faith. But no faith is justifying which is not powerful in sanctifying the heart, and regulating all its affections by the love of Christ. We must devote and give up to God our souls and our bodies: our souls in believing with the heart, and our bodies in confessing with the mouth. The believer shall never have cause to repent his confident trust in the Lord Jesus. Of such faith no sinner shall be ashamed before God; and he ought to glory in it before men.</body></html>
