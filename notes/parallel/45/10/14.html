But before either the last or the first of these steps is taken the gospel must be preached. The Jew, however, cannot plead that the gospel has not been preached to him. It <span class= "ital">has</span> been preached both to Jew and Gentile. Both Moses and Isaiah had foretold the conversion of the Gentiles, and Isaiah had also foretold the unbelief of the Jews.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</span> This question may be taken, in the first place, as serving to connect the two passages from Joel and from Isaiah (see previous note). But it is further the beginning of a sorites, suggested by a new thought, which is carried out to the end of the chapter. The course of this new thought through the rest of the chapter may be expounded as follows: It might be pleaded, in behalf of the unbelieving Jews, that they had never really heard, through preachers duly sent to them, the gospel message; and hence that they were not to be blamed for rejecting it. With this idea before him, the apostle first (vers. 14, 15) allows generally, in the form of a series of questions, that, as before <span class="accented">calling on the Lord</span> there must be <span class="accented">faith</span>, so before <span class="accented">faith</span> there must be <span class="accented">hearing</span>, before <span class="accented">hearing</span> there must <span class="accented">be preaching</span>, and for <span class="accented">preaching</span> there must be authorizing <span class="accented">mission</span>; and he quotes, in illustration, a passage from Isaiah, which describes beautifully the preaching of good tidings of peace by commissioned messengers to all the world. But he is careful to add (vers. 16, 17) that, according to the same prophet, such universal <span class="accented">preaching</span>, and consequent <span class="accented">hearing</span>, does not involve universal <span class="accented">hearkening</span>; thus showing, in view of the main purpose of his argument, that the fact of the Jews not <span class="accented">hearkening</span> now is no evidence that they had not <span class="accented">heard.</span> Then he goes on to ask whether any could plead the excuse of not having <span class="accented">heard</span>, so as to justify want of the <span class="accented">faith</span> that cometh of <span class="accented">hearing.</span> Nay, he replies (ver. 18), the sound of the good tidings has gone forth to all the earth, even like the language of nature spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>. Then (ver. 19), pressing his argument home to the Jews, who have been all along in view, he asks, "But I say, Did not <span class="accented">Israel</span> know?" The word <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, being different from <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> previously used, must express some different meaning. But what St. Paul exactly meant by it is not quite clear. The quotations from the Old Testament that follow in proof of knowledge (vers. 19, 20) seem to support the view that what Israel knew, or ought to have known, was the Divine design of the promulgation of the "good tidings" to all the world, which has just been spoken cf. Such promulgation should have been to them no stumbling-block; for it had been told to them from Moses downwards, and they had full opportunity of <span class="accented">knowing</span> it. Lastly (ver. 21), the apostle intimates that the present state of things, in which Gentiles accept the gospel while Israel in the main rejects it, far from being an objection to it, is but a further fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecies, which represent God as making himself known to those who had not known him, while pleading with Israel in vain. This exposition of the supposed course of thought being borne in mind, the passage (with the further aid of some interposed comments) may become intelligible. It continues: And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard! and how shall they hear without a preacher! and how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that [preach the gospel (or, good <span class="accented">tidings</span>) of peace, and] bring glad tidings of flood things! (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-7.htm">Isaiah 3:7</a>). The genuineness of the. words within brackets is at least doubtful. Even with them the text is not quoted in full, though sufficiently to remind of its purport. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-17 There is not one God to the Jews, more kind, and another to the Gentiles, who is less kind; the Lord is a Father to all men. The promise is the same to all, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, as God manifest in the flesh. All believers thus call upon the Lord Jesus, and none else will do so humbly or sincerely. But how should any call on the Lord Jesus, the Divine Saviour, who had not heard of him? And what is the life of a Christian but a life of prayer? It shows that we feel our dependence on him, and are ready to give up ourselves to him, and have a believing expectation of our all from him. It was necessary that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles. Somebody must show them what they are to believe. How welcome the gospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached! The gospel is given, not only to be known and believed, but to be obeyed. It is not a system of notions, but a rule of practice. The beginning, progress, and strength of faith is by hearing. But it is only hearing the word, as the word of God that will strengthen faith.</body></html>
