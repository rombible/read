They ran through the whole catalogue of sins, and the cup of their iniquity was full.<p>In the passage taken as a whole, three steps or stages are indicated: (1) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18-23</a>, idolatry; (2) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24-27</a>, unnatural sins allowed by God as the punishment for this idolatry; (3) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28-32</a>, a still more complete and radical depravity also regarded as penally inflicted. The first step is taken by the free choice of man, but as the breach gradually widens, the wrath of God is more and more revealed. He interferes less and less to save a sinful world from its fate. It is to be noted that the Apostle speaks in general terms, and the precise proportions of human depravity and of divine judicial impulse are not to be clearly determined.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, here in the Textus Receptus, is ill supported) <span class="cmt_word">gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, to dishonour their own bodies between</span> (rather, <span class="accented">among</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>themselves</span>. So <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., is rendered in the Authorized Version. The verb, however, is probably passive, a middle use of it not being elsewhere found. In either ease the general meaning is the same. The genitive, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, seems most naturally taken as denoting what the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> consisted in, rather than either the <span class="accented">purpose</span> or the <span class="accented">results</span> of their being given over to it (cf. ver. 26, where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is followed by a description of what these were). Here is noticed a further stage of judicial degradation; the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of idolatry, itself judicial, had its further judicial consequence in the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of abominable sensuality. Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4</a>, the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1fb3;</span>, prevalent among the nations, is traced to their <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, in that they had become "alienated from the life of God." It is notorious that idolatrous worship was not uncommonly accompanied by debauchery; notably that of the Phoenician Astarte, and of Aphrodite and Dionysus (see Livy, 39:8, for an account of the Dionysus at one time in Rome; and Athen., 13. pp. 574, 579, and 14. p. 659, for the Aphrodisia at Athens and Corinth); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, etc., "The people joined themselves unto Baal-peor," and the allusion to it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>. On that occasion no more is intimated than promiscuous intercourse between the two sexes, sinking men in that regard to the level of the brutes; but still worse "uncleanness" is in the apostle's view, such as sinks them even below that level; and how common such unnatural vices had become, and how lightly thought of, no one conversant with classical literature needs to be reminded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of the gospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape his wrath by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.</body></html>
