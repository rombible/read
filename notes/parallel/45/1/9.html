Here it is somewhat metaphorical: "Whom I serve, not so much with outward acts as with the ritual of the spirit."<p><span class= "bld">With my spirit.</span>--"Spirit" is with St. Paul the highest part or faculty in the nature of man. It is the seat of his higher consciousness--the organ by which he communicates with God. "Certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body; and if he be not of kin to God by his spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature." (Bacon, <span class= "ital">Essay on Atheism.</span>) Of itself the "spirit" of man is neutral. When brought into contact with the Spirit of God, it is capable of a truly religious life; but apart from this influence, it is apt to fall under the dominion of the "flesh"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of those evil appetites and desires to which man is exposed by his physical organisation.<p><span class= "bld">In the gospel of his Son.</span>--The sphere to which the Apostle feels himself called, and in which this heart-worship of his finds its field of operation, is the defence and preaching, &c., of the gospel.<p>(9-11) It is the constant subject of the Apostle's prayers that he may succeed in making his way to Rome; so anxious is he to open his heart to that Church in personal- apostolic intercourse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you in my prayers</span>. A like solemn asseveration is made with a like intention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>). It expresses the writer's earnestness, and is in place for attestation of a fact known only to himself and God. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, ("I serve"), when used in a religious sense, most usually denotes "worship," and specifically the priestly services of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).

As in our purposes, so in our desires, we must remember to say, If the Lord will, Jas 4:15. Our journeys are made prosperous or otherwise, according to the will of God. We should readily impart to others what God has trusted to us, rejoicing to make others joyful, especially taking pleasure in communing with those who believe the same things with us. If redeemed by the blood, and converted by the grace of the Lord Jesus, we are altogether his; and for his sake we are debtors to all men, to do all the good we can. Such services are our duty.</body></html>
