It is difficult to render in English <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> so as to retain the apparently intended correspondence between the verb and the adjective. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is capable of the senses <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "to prove" (as in assaying metals), and, generally, "to discern," or "judge;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "to approve," after supposed proving. Jowett, in his commentary on this Epistle, endeavours to retain in English the correspondence between <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> by translating, "As they did not <span class="accented">discern</span> to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an <span class="accented">undiscerning</span> mind," thus taking the verb in sense (1), and the adjective in the same sense actively. But it is at least doubtful whether <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> can be taken in an active sense, which is not its classical one. In the New Testament it occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>. In the first of the above passages the word obviously means "rejected" (in the Authorized Version <span class="accented">a castaway</span>), with reference to the comparison of a competitor in athletic contests being proved unworthy of the prize - a sense cognate to the common one of the same adjective as applied to spurious metals, rejected or worthless after being tested. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6</a>, either sense seems admissible - <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But not so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>, where the word is applied to barren land. The passages from 2 Timothy and Titus may in themselves admit the sense of <span class="accented">undiscerning</span>, but the passive one is more probable in view of the common usage of the word. On the other hand, ch. 12:2 may be adduced in favour of the active sense; for there the consequence of the renewal of the mind in Christians is said to be that they may <span class="accented">prove</span>, or <span class="accented">discern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>), what is Gods will; and hence it may seem probable that the want of such <span class="accented">discernment is</span> denoted here. The same passage also favours the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> being taken here in sense (1) given above, and Jowett's rendering of the whole passage. It is, after all, uncertain; nor does it follow that the Greek <span class="accented">paronomasia</span> can be reproduced in English. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-32 In the horrid depravity of the heathen, the truth of our Lord's words was shown: Light was come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil; for he that doeth evil hateth the light. The truth was not to their taste. And we all know how soon a man will contrive, against the strongest evidence, to reason himself out of the belief of what he dislikes. But a man cannot be brought to greater slavery than to be given up to his own lusts. As the Gentiles did not like to keep God in their knowledge, they committed crimes wholly against reason and their own welfare. The nature of man, whether pagan or Christian, is still the same; and the charges of the apostle apply more or less to the state and character of men at all times, till they are brought to full submission to the faith of Christ, and renewed by Divine power. There never yet was a man, who had not reason to lament his strong corruptions, and his secret dislike to the will of God. Therefore this chapter is a call to self-examination, the end of which should be, a deep conviction of sin, and of the necessity of deliverance from a state of condemnation.</body></html>
