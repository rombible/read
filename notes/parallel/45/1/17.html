The essential part on man's side, the beginning and end of that plan, is Faith. For which there was authority in the Old Testament, where it is said, "The just shall live by faith."<p><span class= "bld">The righteousness of God.</span>--By this is not meant, as might, perhaps, be supposed, an attribute of the divine nature--as if the essential righteousness of God were first made known through the gospel. St. Paul goes on to show in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19-20</a>, that so much at least of the nature of God might be known without any supernatural revelation. "Of God" means in the present instance "which proceeds from God." And the "righteousness" which thus "proceeds from God" is that condition of righteousness in man into which he enters by his participation in the Messianic kingdom. The whole object of the coming of the Messiah was to make men "righteous" before God. This was done more especially by the death of Christ upon the cross, which, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24-26</a>, had the effect of making God "propitious" towards men. The benefit of this act is secured to all who make good their claim to be considered members of the Messianic kingdom by a loyal adhesion to the Messiah. Such persons are treated as if they were "righteous," though the righteousness that is thus attributed to them is not any actual merit of their own, but an ideal condition in which they are placed by God. This is the well-known doctrine of justification by faith. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus A: On the Meaning of the word Righteousness in the Epistle to the Romans,</span> and <span class= "ital">Excursus E: On the Doctrine of Justification by Faith and Imputed Righteousness.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Revealed.</span>--God's purpose of thus justifying men is in process of being revealed or declared in the gospel. It is revealed theoretically in the express statements of the way in which man may be justified. It is revealed practically in the heartfelt acceptance of those statements and the change of life which they involved. To the Romans the moment of revelation was that in which they first heard the gospel. St. Paul wishes them to know the full significance--the philosophy, as it might be called--of that which they had heard.<p><span class= "bld">From faith to faith</span>.--It is by faith that man first lays hold on the gospel, and its latest product is a heightened and intensified faith. Apart from faith, the gospel remains null and void for the individual. It is not realised. But when it has been once realised and taken home to the man's self, its tendency is to confirm and strengthen that very faculty by which it was apprehended. It does that for which the disciples prayed when they said, "Lord, increase our faith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-5.htm" title="And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.">Luke 17:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The just shall live by faith.</span>--The words are part of the consolatory answer which the prophet Habakkuk receives in the stress of the Chaldean invasion. Though his irresistible hosts sweep over the land, the righteous man who puts his trust in God shall live. Perhaps St. Paul intended the words "by faith" to be taken rather with "the just" than as they stand in the English version. "The just by faith," or "The man whose righteousness is based on faith," shall live.<p>The Apostle uses the word "faith" in his own peculiar and pregnant sense. But this is naturally led up to by the way in which it was used by Habakkuk. The intense personal trust and reliance which the Jew felt in the God of his fathers is directed by the Christian to Christ, and is further developed into an active energy of devotion.<p>"Faith," as understood by St. Paul, is not merely head-belief, a purely intellectual process such as that of which St. James spoke when he said "the devils also believe and tremble"; neither is it merely "trust," a passive dependence upon an Unseen Power; but it is a further stage of feeling developed out of these, a current of emotion setting strongly in the direction of its object, an ardent and vital apprehension of that object, and a firm and loyal attachment to it. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus B: On the Meaning of the word Faith.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>. - II. THE DOCTRINAL PART OF THE EPISTLE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-39.htm">Romans 8:39</a>. - C. <span class="accented">The doctrine of the righteousness of God propounded, established, and explained.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - This verse, though connected in sequence of thought with the preceding verse, may properly be taken in conjunction with the doctrinal argument which follows, serving, in fact, as its thesis. <span class="cmt_word">For the righteousness of God is therein revealed from</span> (or, <span class="accented">by</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous by</span> (or, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="cmt_word">faith shall live</span>. It is to be observed that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> is the preposition before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> in both clauses of the sentence, though our Authorized Version makes a difference. Further, we render, with the Authorized Version, "<span class="accented">the</span> righteousness of God," rather than "<span class="accented">a</span> righteousness," as in the Revised Version, notwithstanding the absence of the article. For what is meant is the definite conception, pervading the Epistle, of <span class="accented">God's righteousness.</span> If there were room for doubt, it would surely be removed by <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, also without the article, immediately following, and with the same verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Revisers, translating here "tins wrath," have given in the margin as tenable "a <span class="accented">wrath</span>," apparently for the sake of consistency with their rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. But "<span class="accented">a</span> wrath of God" has no intelligible meaning. The expressions seem simply to mean <span class="accented">God's righteousness</span> and <span class="accented">God's wrath.</span> This expression, "the righteousness of God," has been discussed in the Introduction, to which the reader is referred. Its intrinsic meaning is there taken to be God's own eternal righteousness, revealed in Christ for reconciling the world to himself, rather than (as commonly interpreted) the <span class="accented">forensic</span> righteousness (so called) imputed to man. Thus there is no need to understand the genitive <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> as <span class="accented">gen. auctoris</span>, or as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The phrase is understood in the sense that would be familiar to St. Paul and his readers from the Old Testament; and it is conceived that this intrinsic sense pervades the whole Epistle even when a righteousness imputed to <span class="accented">man</span> is spoken of; the idea still being that of the Divine righteousness embracing man. It is not clear in what exact sense <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is to be understood. Most commentators, taking <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> to denote man's imputed righteousness, connect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with it, as if <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> had been written (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>). But the absence of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span>, as well as the collocation of words, seems rather to connect it with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It may be meant to express the subjective condition for man's apprehension, and appropriation, of God's righteousness. The revelation of it to man's own soul is said to be <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> while <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> expresses the result; viz. faith unto salvation. A like use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. In the last of these passages <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, has a close resemblance to the expression before us. The quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> seems mainly meant to illustrate what has been said concerning <span class="accented">faith</span>, though the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs in it in connection with faith, may have also suggested it as apposite, as is evidently the case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, where St. Paul quotes it in proof of the position that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>. The prophet had in immediate view the trials of faith peculiar to his own time, and had cried, "LORD, how long?" But he had stood upon his watch to look out for what the LORD would say unto him; and an answer had come to him to the effect that, in spite of appearances, his prophetic vision would ere long be realized, God's promises to the faithful would certainly be fulfilled, and that <span class="accented">faith</span> meanwhile must be their sustaining principle - "The just shall live by his faith." So in the Hebrew. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (A.), or <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (B). The variations do not affect the general sense of the passage. Now some, supposing St. Paul to connect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as part of the subject of the sentence, would accuse him of giving the quotation a meaning not intended by the prophet, who evidently meant <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> to go with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as part of the predicate. But there is no reason for attributing this intention to St. Paul, except on the supposition that he had previously connected <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. But we have seen reason for concluding that this was not so. The quotation, in the sense intended by the prophet, is sufficiently apposite. For it expresses that <span class="accented">faith</span> is the life-principle of God's righteous ones, while the whole passage at the end of which it occurs declares the salvation of prophetic vision to be entirely of God, to be waited for and apprehended by man through faith, not brought about by his own doings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:16,17 In these verses the apostle opens the design of the whole epistle, in which he brings forward a charge of sinfulness against all flesh; declares the only method of deliverance from condemnation, by faith in the mercy of God, through Jesus Christ; and then builds upon it purity of heart, grateful obedience, and earnest desires to improve in all those Christian graces and tempers, which nothing but a lively faith in Christ can bring forth. God is a just and holy God, and we are guilty sinners. It is necessary that we have a righteousness to appear in before him: there is such a righteousness brought in by the Messiah, and made known in the gospel; a gracious method of acceptance, notwithstanding the guilt of our sins. It is the righteousness of Christ, who is God, coming from a satisfaction of infinite value. Faith is all in all, both in the beginning and progress of Christian life. It is not from faith to works, as if faith put us into a justified state, and then works kept us in it; but it is all along from faith to faith; it is faith pressing forward, and gaining the victory over unbelief.</body></html>
