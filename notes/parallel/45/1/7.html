The same MS., with some others, alters the next phrase, "beloved of God" to "in the love of God," thus substituting for the special address to the Romans a general address to all "who are in the love of God." Traces of a similar reading appear to be found in the two earliest commentators on the Epistle, Origen (<span class= "ital">ob.</span> A.D. 253) and the Ambrosian Hilary (A.D. 366-384). The Codex Boernerianus also omits the words "at Rome" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-15.htm" title="So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.">Romans 1:15</a>, while at the end of the Epistle it interposes a blank space between Romans 14, 15. These peculiarities give some support to the theory that the Epistle to the Romans was circulated, most probably with the sanction of the Apostle himself, in the form of a general treatise, with the personal matter eliminated. This theory will be found more fully discussed in the Notes on the last two chapters.<p><span class= "bld">Beloved</span> <span class= "bld">of</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>--Reconciled to God through the death of His Son, and therefore with the barrier that separated you from His love removed.<p><span class= "bld">Called to be</span> <span class= "bld">saints.</span>--Consecrated or set apart by His own special summons, brought within the sphere and range of the holy life.<p>These epithets, high-sounding as they are, if applied by a modern writer to a modern church would seem to be indiscriminating or conventional, but as coming from St. Paul they have not yet lost their freshness and reality. They correspond to no actual condition of things, but to that ideal condition in which all Christians, by the mere fact of their being Christians, are supposed to be. They are members of the new Messianic kingdom, and share in all its privileges. The Apostle will not let them forget this, but holds it up before them as a mirror to convict them if they are unfaithful.<p><span class= "bld">Grace . . . and peace.</span>--May God and Christ look favourably upon you, and may you enjoy, as the result of that favour, the peace and composure of mind which is the proper attribute of the Christian.<p>The terms "grace" and "peace" nearly correspond to two ordinary forms of Jewish salutation, the first of which has also something of a counterpart among the Greeks and Romans. But here, as elsewhere, the Apostle has given to them a heightened and deepened Christian signification. Grace is the peculiar state of favour with God and Christ, into which the sincere Christian is admitted. Peace is the state of mind resulting from the sense of that favour.<p>"The <span class= "ital">joy</span> Thy <span class= "ital">favour</span> gives,<p>Let me again obtain."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called</span> to be <span class="cmt_word">saints</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in ver. 1). Bengel's view, that by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> are specially meant the Jewish Christians, as being "beloved for the fathers' sakes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>), and by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> the Gentile converts, is untenable. Both phrases are applicable to all. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, be it observed, is elsewhere used to denote all Christians, without implying eminence in personal holiness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</span>. The union, here and elsewhere, of Jesus Christ with the Father as imparting heavenly blessing, implies his Deity no less than any dogmatic statement could do; for it is surely impossible to conceive the apostle thus associating with the Godhead one whom he regarded as a mere human being. The same form of benediction is found at the beginning of all St. Paul's Epistles, and there can be no doubt that its meaning is as given above. For, though here, in 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon, this collocation of words might allow the rendering, "Grace... from God, the Father of us and of the Lord Jesus Christ," yet in Galatians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus, it is obviously inadmissible. And even without these instances the true meaning would have been probable from <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> coming <span class="accented">before</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. If the apostle had intended to express a common Fatherhood of God, he would surely not have written, "Our Father and Christ's," but rather, "Christ's and ours" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The doctrine of which the apostle Paul wrote, set forth the fulfilment of the promises by the prophets. It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
