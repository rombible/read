The phrase "into a lie," is literally, <span class= "ital">with a lie,</span> the "lie" being regarded as the instrument by which the substitution is made. By "a lie" is meant here "false gods," who are the supreme embodiment of falsehood. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-20.htm" title="He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?">Isaiah 44:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-25.htm" title="This is your lot, the portion of your measures from me, said the LORD; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.">Jeremiah 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-19.htm" title="O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to you from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.">Jeremiah 16:19</a>, &c.)<p>The introduction of the doxology in this verse is due to an impulse of reverential feeling. Shocked at the language which he finds himself using, and at the connection in which the most Holy Name has been mentioned, the Apostle turns aside for a moment to testify to his own humble adoration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who</span> (rather, <span class="accented">being such as</span>, the word is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">quippequi</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

Gravitas et ardor stilt judicialis proprietate verborum non violat verceundiam" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of the gospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape his wrath by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.</body></html>
