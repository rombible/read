A divinely appointed minister of a system of things predicted by the prophets, and culminating in the revelation, divinely ordained and attested, of Jesus Christ, he greets the Roman Christians, themselves also divinely called. Note the repetition of terms signifying "calling," "selection," "determination in the counsels and providence of God;" as if to say: "I and you alike are all members of one grand scheme, which is not of human invention, but determined and ordained of God--the divine clue, as it were, running through the history of the world." A solemn note is thus struck at the very commencement, and in what might have been regarded as the more formal part of the Epistle, by which the readers are prepared for the weighty issues that are to be set before them.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Servant.</span>--More strictly, here as elsewhere in the New Testament, <span class= "ital">slave;</span> and yet not wrongly translated "servant," because the compulsory and degrading side of service is not put forward. The idea of "slavery" in the present day has altogether different associations.<p><span class= "bld">Separated.</span>--Compare especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a> ("Separate me Barnabas and Saul"), where human instruments--the leaders of the Church at Antioch--are employed to carry out the divine will. The reference here is to the historical fact of the selection of St. Paul to be an Apostle; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm" title="But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,">Galatians 1:15</a> (<span class= "ital">"</span>it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb"), it is rather to the more distant act of divine predestination.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the gospel of God.</span>--Singled out and set apart to convey the message of salvation from God to man. The ambiguous genitive, the gospel of God, seems to mean, "the gospel which proceeds from God," "of which God is the <span class= "ital">author;</span>" not "of which God is the <span class= "ital">object."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called</span> to be <span class="cmt_word">an apostle</span>. In his salutations to the Philippians and to Titus also St. Paul calls himself <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "bondservant") of Jesus Christ; but usually only <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which is rightly translated in the Authorized Version, "called to be an apostle," Divine vocation to the office being the prominent idea. St. Paul often elsewhere insists on the reality of his vocation from Christ himself to be an apostle to the Gentiles; and this with regard to disparagement of his claim to be a true apostle at all on the part of some (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>). It does not follow from his thus asserting his claim here and afterwards in this Epistle that he was aware of any disparagement of it at that time among the Roman Christians; still less that he wrote his Epistle with a polemical purpose against the Judaizers, as some have supposed. Still, he may have suspected that some might possibly have been busy there, as they were in other places; and, however that might be, writing as he was to a Church not founded by, and as yet unvisited by, himself, he might think distinct assertions of his claim to be heard desirable. <span class="cmt_word">Separated</span> (or, <span class="accented">set apart</span>) unto <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the gospel of God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the preaching of the gospel, not the reception of it only, as is evident from the context.

It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
