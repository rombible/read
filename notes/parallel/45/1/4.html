And yet there is a difference, the precise shade of which is not easy to define. What are we to understand by the "spirit of holiness"? Are we to regard it as simply convertible with "Holy Spirit"? Not quite. Or are we to look upon it as corresponding to "the flesh," as "spirit" and "flesh" correspond in man? Again, not quite--or not merely. The spirit of Christ is human, for Christ took upon Him our nature in all its parts. It is human; and yet it is in it more especially that the divinity resides. It is in it that the "Godhead dwells bodily," and the presence of the Godhead is seen in the peculiar and exceptional "holiness" by which it is characterised. The "spirit," therefore, or that portion of His being to which St. Paul gives the name, in Christ, is the connecting-link between the human and the divine, and shares alike in both. It is the divine "enshrined" in the human, or the human penetrated and energised by the divine. It is, perhaps, not possible t<span class= "ital">o</span> get beyond metaphorical language such as this. The junction of the human and divine must necessarily evade exact definition, and to carry such definition too far would be to misrepresent the meaning of the Apostle. We may compare with this passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, "God (rather, <span class= "ital">Who</span>) was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit:" or St. Peter's phrase, "Put to death in the flesh. but quickened by the Spirit"--rather, <span class= "ital">in the spirit,</span> as the seat of that divinity by virtue of which He overcame death--(<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>).<p>The particular act in which the Sonship of Christ was most conspicuously ratified and confirmed was His resurrection from the dead. It was ratified by His resurrection, as a manifestation of transcendent and divine power. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm" title="Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.">Acts 2:24</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-24.htm" title="But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;">Romans 4:24</a>.)<p>It should be observed that this antithesis between the human and divine nature in Christ is not here intended to carry with it any disparagement of the former. Rather the Apostle wishes to bring out the completeness and fulness of the dignity of Christ, as exhibited on both its sides. He is at once the Jewish Messiah (and with the Jewish section of the Church at Rome this fact would carry great weight) and the Son of God.<p><span class= "bld">By the resurrection from the dead.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">by the resurrection of the dead.</span> There is a slight distinction to be observed between the two phrases. It is not "by <span class= "ital">His</span> resurrection <span class= "ital">from</span> the dead," but in an abstract and general sense, "by <span class= "ital">the</span> resurrection <span class= "ital">of</span> the dead"--by that resurrection of which Christ was the firstfruits.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who was declared</span> (so Authorized Version) <span class="cmt_word">the Son of God with</span> (literally, in) <span class="cmt_word">power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of</span> (not as in Authorized Version, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the dead</span>.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means properly to "appoint" or "determine;" and if this meaning be re-mined, the whole passage would seem to preclude the idea of Sonship previous to the Resurrection being in view. Hence commentators ancient and modern agree generally in assigning an unusual meaning to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>-here, making it signify "declared," as in the Authorized Version. So Chrysostom, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x37e;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Hom. 2 p. 432, D). It is maintained that this use of the word, though unusual, is legitimate; since a person may be said to be appointed, or determined, to be what he already is, when his being such is declared and manifested. Thus, it may be said, a king may be spoken of as appointed king when he is crowned, though he was king before; or a saint determined a saint when he is canonized; and the classical phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of <span class="accented">deify</span>, is adduced as parallel. Thus the expression is made to mean that "the same who <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> was known only as the descendant of David, is now declared to be the Son of God" (Tholuck); <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f30;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Cyril); and St. Paul's reason for thus putting it, in pursuance of his course of thought, is thus explained by Meyer; "Paul gives the two main epochs in the history of the Son of God as they had actually occurred, and had been prophetically announced;" also by Bengel thus, "Etiam ante exinanitionem suam Filius Dei is quidem fuit: sed exinanitione filiatio occultata fuit, et plene demure retecta post resurrectionem." This interpretation would be more satisfactory than it is if the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> were found similarly used in any other part of the New Testament. It occurs in the following passages, and always in its proper and usual sense: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-22.htm">Luke 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-7.htm">Hebrews 4:7</a>. Of these especially significant are <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a> (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). In both of these texts the word denotes God's <span class="accented">appointment</span> or <span class="accented">determination</span> of Christ to the office of Judge, not merely a <span class="accented">declaration</span> or <span class="accented">manifestation</span> of his already being so; and it is to be observed that in the second the language is given as that of St. Paul himself, and that it corresponds with the passage before us in that the Resurrection is spoken of as the display to the world of Christ being so appointed or determined. Surely, then, there ought to be cogent reason for giving <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> a different meaning here; and, in spite of the weight of authority on the other side, it is submitted that we are under no necessity to do so, if we bear in mind what appeared under ver. 3 as to the different senses in which Christ is designated <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. In the sense apparent is Messianic prophecy, and pervading the Epistle to the Hebrews, in the sense which seems intended by St. Paul himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32, 33</a>, it was not till after the Resurrection that Christ attained his position of royal Sonship; it was then that the Divine <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> took effect in that regard. It is true that St. Paul (as was seen under ver. 3) himself conceived of Christ as essentially Son of God from eternity; but here, while speaking of the fulfilment of Messianic prophecy, and desiring to point out what was patent to all who believed that Christ had risen, he may fitly refer to his exaltation only, in virtue of which, further, he had himself received his apostolic commission, of which he proceeds to speak, and the assertion which he has had all along in view. The above interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> appears, further, to have the weighty support of Pearson, who, speaking of Christ's fourfold right unto the title of "the Son of God" - by generation, as begotten of God; by commission, as sent by him; by resurrection, as the Firstborn; by actual possession, as Heir of all - refers thus to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>: 'Thus was he defined, or constituted, and 'appointed to be the Son of God with power by the Resurrection from the dead'", (Pearson on the Creed, art. 2.). <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (to be connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) denotes the Divine power displayed in the Resurrection (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, "the exceeding greatness of <span class="accented">his power</span>,... according to the working of the strength of his might, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead;" cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>). In the last two of these passages, <span class="accented">power</span> evidenced in resurrection is contrasted with human <span class="accented">weakness</span> evidenced in death: <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 3 is opposed, not simply <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f51;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (the spirit <span class="accented">of holiness</span>), so as to denote the Divine element that was all along in the Incarnate Son, in virtue of which he rose triumphant over human <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. We too are composed of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; but the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in Christ was one of absolute <span class="accented">holiness -</span> the holiness of Deity; not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, holiness in the abstract, attributed to Deity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10</a>), nor <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> "sanctification," of which man is capable; but <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, an inherent quality of Divine holiness ("Quasi tres sint gradus, <span class="accented">sanctificatio, sanctimonia, sanctitas,"</span> Bengel). Because of this "spirit of holiness" that was in Christ, "it was not possible that he should be holden of" death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>). Through this, which was in himself - not merely through a Divine power external to himself calling him from the grave, as he had called Lazarus - he overcame death (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35</a>, "Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption"). It was through this too (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) that he "offered himself without spot to God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>); and in the same sense may be understood <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>). Neither in these passages nor in the one before us is the <span class="accented">Holy Spirit</span> meant, in the sense of a distinct Person of the Holy Trinity. Further, the preposition in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> does not denote (as explained by Theodoret, Luther, and Grotius) the <span class="accented">time</span> from which the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> began in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, but the <span class="accented">source</span> out of which it proceeded. "<span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3ba;</span> non mode tempus, sed nexum rerum denotat" (Bengel). Further, the phrase is not "resurrection <span class="accented">from</span> the dead," as in the Authorized Version, but "<span class="accented">of</span> the dead," which may be purposely used so as to point, not only to the fact of Christ's own resurrection, but also to its significance for mankind. The same expression often occurs elsewhere with a comprehensive meaning (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm">Acts 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The resurrection of Christ expressed "the power of an endless life," here and hereafter, for mankind, carrying with it the possibility of the resurrection of all from the dominion of death in the risen Son. One view of the meaning of the whole of the above passage - that of Chrysostom and Melancthon - may be mentioned because of the weight of these authorities, though it cannot be the true one. They take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, as co-ordinate, regarding them as the three proofs of Christ's eternal Sonship. <span class="accented">i.e. miracles, the communication of the Holy Ghost</span>, and <span class="accented">the resurrection. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Jesus Christ our Lord</span>; thus in conclusion distinctly identifying the Son of prophecy with the Jesus who had lately appeared, and was acknowledged by the Christians as the Messiah, and commonly by them called <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The force of the passage is weakened in the Authorized Version by the transposition of <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to the beginning of ver. 3, as also by the inclusion of ver. 2 in a parenthesis, so as to separate it from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> which follows. (See explanation given above.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The doctrine of which the apostle Paul wrote, set forth the fulfilment of the promises by the prophets. It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
