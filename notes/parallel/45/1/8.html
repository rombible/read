He had long and earnestly desired to visit them in person. Yes, even in Rome he must preach the gospel--of which he is not ashamed, but proud. It is fraught with nothing less than salvation itself alike to Jew and Gentile. In it is revealed that great plan or scheme of God by which man is made just before Him.<p>To the modern reader who does not make an effort to enter into the mind of the Apostle, the language of these verses, may seem too high-pitched for the occasion. It is not easy to realise the intensity with which St. Paul felt on what in any degree, however small, affected the spiritual life of those who acknowledged the same Master that he did. He had few of those petty distractions that we have. The whole force of his rich and impressible nature was concentrated upon this one subject; and his expressions reflect the state of tension in which he felt himself to be. Thus it is that they take a solemnity and earnestness to which an ordinary correspondence would not attain.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">I thank my God through Jesus Christ.</span>--How can the Apostle be said to thank God <span class= "ital">through</span> Jesus Christ? Christ is, as it were, the medium through whom God has been brought into close relation to man. Hence all intercourse between God and man is represented as passing through Him. He is not only the divine <span class= "ital">Logos</span> by whom God is revealed to man, but He is also the Head of humanity by whom the tribute of thanks and praise is offered to God.<p><span class= "bld">Throughout the whole world.</span>--A hyperbole, which is the more natural as the Apostle is speaking of Rome, the centre and metropolis of the world as he knew it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-17.</span> - B. <span class="accented">Introduction, in which the writer expresses his strong interest in the Roman Church, his long-cherished desire to visit it, and the grounds of this desire.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of</span> (rather, <span class="accented">proclaimed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in the whole world</span>. We observe here, as in other Epistles, St. Paul's way of beginning with complimentary language, and expression of thankfulness for the good he knew of in his readers. He thus intimates at the outset his own good feeling towards them, and predisposes them to take in good part any animadversions that may follow. "The whole world" is not, of course, to be taken literally, but as a phrase denoting general notoriety. Similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>. Any considerable number of converts in so important a place as Rome would be likely to become notorious in all Christian circles, and even outside them might have already begun to attract attention. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-15 We must show love for our friends, not only by praying for them, but by praising God for them. As in our purposes, so in our desires, we must remember to say, If the Lord will, Jas 4:15. Our journeys are made prosperous or otherwise, according to the will of God. We should readily impart to others what God has trusted to us, rejoicing to make others joyful, especially taking pleasure in communing with those who believe the same things with us. If redeemed by the blood, and converted by the grace of the Lord Jesus, we are altogether his; and for his sake we are debtors to all men, to do all the good we can. Such services are our duty.</body></html>
