He must preach the gospel to men of all classes and tongues; Rome itself is no exception.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">To the Greeks, and to the Barbarians.</span>--The Apostle does not intend to place the Romans any more in the one class than in the other. He merely means "to all mankind, no matter what their nationality or culture." The classification is exhaustive. It must be remembered that the Greeks called all who did not speak their own language "Barbarians," and the Apostle, writing from. Greece, adopts their point of view.<p><span class= "bld">Wise and foolish.</span>--(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-26.htm" title="For you see your calling, brothers, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:">1Corinthians 1:26-28</a>.) The gospel was at first most readily received by the poor and unlearned, but it did not therefore follow that culture and education were by any means excluded. St. Paul himself was a conspicuous instance to the contrary. And so, in the next century, the Church which began with such leaders as Ignatius and Polycarp, could number among its members before the century was out, Irenaeus, and Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria, and Hippolytus, and Origen--the last, the most learned man of his time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Both to Greeks and Barbarians, both to wise and unwise, I am debtor.

Of course, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> also includes them. The obvious intention of the writer is to place them in each of the higher categories, and so, while after his manner he pays his expected readers a delicate compliment, to insist that his mission is to the highest in position and culture as well as the lowest, cud that, bold in his convictions, he is not ashamed to preach the cross even to them.

As in our purposes, so in our desires, we must remember to say, If the Lord will, Jas 4:15. Our journeys are made prosperous or otherwise, according to the will of God. We should readily impart to others what God has trusted to us, rejoicing to make others joyful, especially taking pleasure in communing with those who believe the same things with us. If redeemed by the blood, and converted by the grace of the Lord Jesus, we are altogether his; and for his sake we are debtors to all men, to do all the good we can. Such services are our duty.</body></html>
