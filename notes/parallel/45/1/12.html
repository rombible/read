He is anxious to see them, that he may impart to them some spiritual gift. But no! He hastily draws back and corrects himself. He does not wish it to be implied that it is for him only to impart, and for them only to receive. He will not assume any such air of superiority. In the impulse of the moment, and in the expansiveness of his own heart, he had seemed to put it so; but his real meaning was that they should receive mutual comfort and edification.<p>Strictly, the idea of <span class= "ital">mutual</span> comfort is drawn from the two verses combined, not from this singly. In the last verse the Romans were the subject: "That <span class= "ital">ye</span> may be established." Here St. Paul himself is the subject: "That <span class= "ital">I</span> may be comforted."<p><span class= "bld">Comforted.</span>--The Greek word has rather more of the sense of our "encouraged," though the idea of "comfort" is also contained in it. It is a similar word to that which is translated "comforter" in several passages in John 14, 15, 16 (where see Notes, and <span class= "ital">Excursus to St. John's Gospel</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Together with you.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">that I may at the same time be comforted among you;</span> that is, "that I may be comforted at the same time that you are comforted, by my intercourse with you, through that mutual faith which acts and reacts upon each of us." The Apostle looks to obtain benefit from his intercourse with the Roman Christians. He expects that their faith will help to increase his own.<p>There is a truth underlying the Apostle's courtesy which is not mere compliment. The most advanced Christian will receive something from the humblest. There are very few men whose "spirits are not finely touched" <span class= "ital">somewhere;</span> and St. Paul was conscious that even an Apostle might not be equally strong at every point.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by each other's faith, yours and mine</span>. The spirit of delicate courtesy here evinced, in addressing persons over whom one loss of a Christian gentleman than St. Paul was might have assumed a lordly tone, is apparent elsewhere in his Epistles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-19.htm">Romans 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-3.htm">2 Corinthians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>, seq.; 2 Corinthians 8:8; 9:2), and especially the whole Epistle to Philemon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-15 We must show love for our friends, not only by praying for them, but by praising God for them. As in our purposes, so in our desires, we must remember to say, If the Lord will, Jas 4:15. Our journeys are made prosperous or otherwise, according to the will of God. We should readily impart to others what God has trusted to us, rejoicing to make others joyful, especially taking pleasure in communing with those who believe the same things with us. If redeemed by the blood, and converted by the grace of the Lord Jesus, we are altogether his; and for his sake we are debtors to all men, to do all the good we can. Such services are our duty.</body></html>
