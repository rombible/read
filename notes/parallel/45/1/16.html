He cannot be ashamed of a scheme so beneficent and so grand. The gospel that he preaches is that mighty agency which God Himself has set in motion, and the object of which is the salvation of all who put their faith in it, to whatever nation or race they may belong. He has, perhaps, in his mind the reception he had met with in other highly civilised cities. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-32.htm" title="And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter.">Acts 17:32</a>.) He had himself once found a "stumbling-block" in the humiliation of the Cross; now, so far from being ashamed of it, it is just that of which he is most proud. The preaching of the Cross is the cardinal point of the whole gospel.<p><span class= "bld">Of Christ.</span>--These words are wanting in the oldest MSS., and should be omitted.<p><span class= "bld">Power of God</span>.--A powerful agency put forth by God Himself--the lever, as it were, by which He would move the world.<p><span class= "bld">Unto salvation.</span>--The object of this gospel is salvation--to open the blessings of the Messianic kingdom to mankind.<p><span class= "bld">To the Jew first.</span>--Here again we have another exhaustive division of mankind. "Greek" is intended to cover all who are not "Jews." Before the Apostle was making, what may be called, the secular classification of men, here he makes the religious classification. From his exceptional privileges the Jew was literally placed in a class alone.<p>It is not quite certain that the word "first" ought not to be omitted. In any case the sense is the same. St. Paul certainly assigns a prerogative position to the Jews. They have an "advantage" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?">Romans 3:1-2</a>). To them belong the special privileges of the first dispensation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4-5</a>). They are the original stock of the olive tree, in comparison with which the Gentiles are only as wild branches grafted in (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a> <span class= "ital">et seq</span>.). It was only right that the salvation promised to their forefathers should be offered first to them, as it is also said expressly in the Fourth Gospel, that "salvation is of the Jews" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm" title="You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.">John 4:22</a>).<p><span class= "bld">First.</span>--A difficult question of textual criticism is raised here. The word is not found in the Vatican MS. in a citation by Tertullian (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> 200 A.D.), and in the Graeco-Latin Codex Boernerianus at Dresden. In all other MSS. and versions it appears. The evidence for the omission is thus small in quantity, though good in quality; and though it shows, in any case, a considerable diffusion in Egypt and Africa as far back as the second century, internal considerations do not tell strongly either way, but it seems a degree more probable that the word was accidentally dropped in some early copy. Of recent editions, it is bracketed by Lachmann, and placed in the margin by Tregelles and Vaughan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I am not ashamed of the gospel</span> (<span class="accented">of Christ</span>, in the Authorized Version, is very weakly supported by manuscripts; neither is it required), <span class="cmt_word">for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and to the Greek</span>. In saying he was "not ashamed," St. Paul may have had in his mind our Lord's own words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>.) We are reminded in this verse of the passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17-31</a>, where the idea here shortly intimated is enlarged on. He was fully aware that the pride of Greek philosophy would be likely to despise the message of the cross as "foolishness." It would be strange to them at first, and out of accord with their intellectual speculations. But he was convinced too that in it was contained the one view of things to meet human needs, and such as to commend itself in the end to thinkers, if their consciences could be roused. In preaching to the Corinthians he had indeed purposely refrained from presenting the gospel to them in "words of man's wisdom," lest the simple message, addressed alike to all, should lose any of its essential power, or be confounded with the human philosophies of the day. But to them also, in his First Epistle, he declares that this was not because it was not "wisdom," as well as "power," to such as could so receive it. Among the more advanced, and therefore more receptive (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), he does, he says, "speak wisdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>), Christianity having, in fact, its own philosophy, appreciable by them. As is well said in the Exposition of 1 Corinthians in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' "No contrast is here at all between reason and revelation, as some think, but strictly between two philosophies - the philosophy of God and the philosophy of the world." Therefore to the Greek, as well as to the Jew, he is not ashamed to preach the cross; and in this Epistle, suitably to its purpose - more, it may be supposed, than his ordinary preaching - he does set forth the Divine philosophy of the gospel. But the message, he adds, is "to the Jew first," because it was to the people of the covenant (cf. ch. 9:4, etc.) that the salvation in Christ was in the first place to be offered. Hence also, in all his missionary work, he first addressed himself to the synagogue, and only when he was rejected there, turned exclusively to the Gentiles. So at Rome too, when he afterwards went there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-17.htm">Acts 28:17-29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:16,17 In these verses the apostle opens the design of the whole epistle, in which he brings forward a charge of sinfulness against all flesh; declares the only method of deliverance from condemnation, by faith in the mercy of God, through Jesus Christ; and then builds upon it purity of heart, grateful obedience, and earnest desires to improve in all those Christian graces and tempers, which nothing but a lively faith in Christ can bring forth. God is a just and holy God, and we are guilty sinners. It is necessary that we have a righteousness to appear in before him: there is such a righteousness brought in by the Messiah, and made known in the gospel; a gracious method of acceptance, notwithstanding the guilt of our sins. It is the righteousness of Christ, who is God, coming from a satisfaction of infinite value. Faith is all in all, both in the beginning and progress of Christian life. It is not from faith to works, as if faith put us into a justified state, and then works kept us in it; but it is all along from faith to faith; it is faith pressing forward, and gaining the victory over unbelief.</body></html>
