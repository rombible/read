St. Augustine notes that grace is common to the Apostle with all believers--his apostleship is something special and peculiar; yet apostleship is an instance, or case, of grace. Origen distinguishes between the two--"grace for the endurance of labours, apostleship for authority in preaching;" but both terms are perhaps somewhat wider than this. Apostleship includes all those privileges which St. Paul possessed as an Apostle; grace is all those privileges that he possessed as a Christian. At the same time, in either case the meaning tends in the direction of that particular object which is expressed in the next clause. The light in which the Apostle valued most the gifts that had been bestowed upon him, was inasmuch as they enabled him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">For obedience to the faith among all nations.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">For</span> (to produce) <span class= "ital">obedience of faith</span> (the obedience which springs from faith) <span class= "ital">among all the Gentiles.</span><p>Faith is not here equivalent to "<span class= "ital">the</span> faith"--a positive body of doctrine received and believed--but, in its strict sense, that active habit and attitude of mind by which the Christian shows his devotion and loyalty to Christ, and his total dependence on Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For his name.</span>--<span class= "ital">For His name's sake.</span> "His," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Christ's. The whole of that divine economy of which St. Paul himself forms part, tends to the glory of Christ. The Apostle's call to his office, his special endowment for his ministry, the success of his preaching among the Gentiles, as they proceed from Christ, so also have for their object the extension of His kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his Name's sake</span>. "We" here means, not Christians generally, but Paul himself (though probably, as also in all other cases where he similarly uses this plural, with the intention of including others, here his fellow-apostles); for the "grace" spoken of is evidently from what follows a special grace for the apostolic office to which he had been called. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> occurs in a like sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-25.htm">Acts 1:25</a>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., denotes the purpose of his apostleship, viz. to bring men everywhere, of whatever race, to believe and obey the gospel; not to a belief in it only, but to the obedience which comes of faith, or which faith renders. "Accepimus mandatum Evangelii ad omnes gentes pro-ferendi, cut illae per fidem obedient" (Calvin). Some take the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, to mean "obedience <span class="accented">to</span> faith," faith being regarded, not as <span class="accented">cause efficiens</span>, but as a commanding principle exacting obedience to itself. So Meyer, who refers to passages where a genitive after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span> has this meaning: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); and also to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f58;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The last of these quotations would have been peculiarly apposite in support of the interpretation contended for, were not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> in the text now before us anarthrous, so as to suggest <span class="accented">subjective</span> faith, rather than "the faith delivered to the saints," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>. The question is, after all, of no importance with regard to the essential idea intended to be conveyed. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> seems to point especially to St. Paul's own apostleship (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 8</a>), though, of course, the apostleship of all, wherever exercised, had a similar worldwide purpose. In using the expression here, he anticipates what he is about to say as to his not shrinking from addressing even the Romans with authority; his mission being to <span class="accented">all</span> the nations. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is best connected with "obedience of faith." The phrase is of frequent occurrence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-26.htm">Acts 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-13.htm">Acts 21:13</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>). It is most usually connected with the idea of suffering in behalf of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The doctrine of which the apostle Paul wrote, set forth the fulfilment of the promises by the prophets. It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
