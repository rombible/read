A slight stress is thus thrown upon the epithet "holy." It is not merely "in certain books which go by the name of holy scriptures," but "in certain writings the character of which is holy." They are "holy" as containing the promises referred to in the text, and others like them. It will thus be seen how even this faint shade of meaning works into the general argument. The writings in which the promises are contained, like the promises themselves, their fulfilment, and the consequences which follow from them, all are part of the same exceptional divine scheme.<p>The prophetic writings describe not only salvation, the <span class= "ital">substance</span> of the gospel, but also the <span class= "ital">preaching</span> of salvation, the gospel itself. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm" title="Speak you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.">Isaiah 40:2</a>, "Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem," and following verses; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm" title="He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.">Isaiah 42:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm" title="Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.

Here the parenthetical passage begins, extending to the end of ver. 6. It is unnecessary to complicate it by connecting <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> with the previous <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It goes more naturally with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, denoting the subject of the Old Testament promises. By <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> are meant not only the sacred writers distinctively so called, but (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>) all who spoke of old under Divine inspiration, as by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is signified the Old Testament generally. This intimation of the gospel being the fulfilment of prophecy is fitly introduced here, as preparing the reader for the argument of the Epistle, in the course of which the doctrine propounded is shown to be in accordance with the Old Testament, and in fact anticipated therein. This is, indeed, a prominent point in the general teaching of apostles and evangelists. They announce the gospel as the fulfilment of prophecy, and the true completion of all the ancient dispensation; and it is to the Old Testament that, in addressing Israelites, they ever in the first place appeal. Thus St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>); thus Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.); thus St. Paul at Antioch in Pisidia, at Thessalonica, and before Agrippa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-6.htm">Acts 26:6, 22</a>); thus Philip to the Ethiopian proselyte (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-35.htm">Acts 8:35</a>); thus Apollos at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>). Our Lord himself had done the same, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27, 44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>. All this is important as showing how the old and new dispensations are regarded together as parts of a whole, the old one being but the needful preparation for a fulfilment in the new, and so becoming intelligible; and thus how "through all the ages one eternal purpose runs." There was also a providential preparation in the Gentile world, though not so direct and obvious, and though, of course, not similarly noticed in addresses to disciples of the Law. But St. Paul intimates it; as in his speech on Areopagus, and also, as will be seen, in this Epistle. Even the gospel (it may be further observed) is set forth as but a further stage of progress towards a final consummation, as the dawn only of a coming daybreak. We have still but an earnest of our inheritance; the "earnest expectation of the creature" still awaits "the manifestation of the sons of God." Meanwhile, in the revelation already made through Christ, and the redemption accomplished by him, we are taught to cling to our faith in a Divine purpose throughout the world's perplexing history - that of resolving at last all discords into eternal harmony, and making manifest "one great love, embracing all." This grand view of a providential order leading to a final consummation (though how and when we know not) pervades St. Paul's writings, and should be kept in mind for a proper understanding of this Epistle. God's promises through his prophets in Holy Scripture are said to have been "concerning his Son;" and a question hence arises as to the exact sense in which "his Son" is to be here understood; a consideration of which question may help our interpretation of the expression in the following verse, which is not without difficulty, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. We may distinguish between three senses in which Christ is called "the Son of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> With reference to his Divine pre-existence, the term expressing his relation to the Father from eternity, like the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (and probably the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) of St. John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> With reference to his incarnation, as being conceived by the Holy Ghost; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> With reference to the position assigned to the Messiah in psalm and prophecy, as the <span class="accented">Son</span> exalted to the right hand of God, and crowned with glory. It is with the last of these three references that the title is used in the Epistle to the Hebrews; where the ideal of sonship, found in the Old Testament, and imperfectly typified by the theoretic position of the theocratic kings, is regarded as prophetic, and pointing to Christ, in whom alone it is shown to be fulfilled. Hence in that Epistle his exaltation to the rank and dignity of <span class="accented">Son</span> is regarded as subsequent to his human obedience, and even the consequence and reward of it. It was "<span class="accented">because</span> <span class="accented">of</span> the suffering of death (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)" that he has been "crowned with glory and honour" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>); it was after he had made a purification of sins that he "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high," having "inherited" that "more excellent name" - the name of Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>). It is by no means implied that the said Epistle does not recognize a true Sonship of Christ <span class="accented">before</span> his exaltation; he was all along "the Son" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, etc.), though not enthroned as such over mankind and all creation till after his resurrection; and, further, the essential doctrine of his pre-existent and eternal Sonship. in the first of the senses noted above, is distinctly taught (as in ch. 1:3), though not there by the use of the term "Son." All we say is that this word is used in the Epistle to the Hebrews to denote Christ's position and office as the royal High Priest of humanity, exalted, after suffering, to the right hand of God, rather than his original Divine Personality; such being the significance of the title in the prophetic anticipations of the Messiah. Now, this being so, and it being the promises made "through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures concerning his Son" that are being spoken of in the passage before us, it may seem at first most probable that the idea here implied by the word "Son" is the same as in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and no more. We ought, however, to take further into account what St. Paul himself seems to signify by the term when he uses it elsewhere. It does not follow that his own conception of its significance was confined to what was apparent in "the prophets." Reading them in the light of the gospel revelation, he may have seen in their language more implied than it distinctly expressed, and himself intended to imply more. The passages in his Epistles, apart from this chapter, where Christ is called God's Son are these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, "We were reconciled to God through the death of his Son;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "Sending his own <span class="accented">Son</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) in the likeness of flesh of sin;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, "To be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the Firstborn among many brethren;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>, "Spared not his own Son (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>);" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>, "The Son of God...  was not Yea and Nay;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4, 6</a>, "God sent forth his Son," - "sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>, "Translates us into the kingdom of the Son of his love." In all these passages - except (3), in which the reference may be only to Christ in glory - the term "Son" denotes a relation (o the Father, peculiar to our Lord, previous to the death and exaltation, and in some of them, (2), (6), (7), previous to the Incarnation. Such previous relation is especially apparent in the sequence to (7), where "the Son of his love" is defined not only as "the Head of the body, the Church," and "the Firstborn from the dead," but also as "the Image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation; for in him all things were created, the things in heaven, and the things on the earth, the things visible and the things invisible; all things through him and unto him have been created." With this may be compared <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-12</a>, where an existence <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, anterior to incarnation, is undoubtedly declared, though the exaltation after human obedience, and the receiving then of "a name that is above every name" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>), is spoken of as well. One other passage remains to be noticed, occurring, not in an Epistle, but in the sermon at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a>), where the view of Christ's Sonship which is found in the Epistle to the Hebrews (no more being expressed) appears as present to St. Paul's mind. For there God is said to have "fulfilled the promise which was made unto the fathers, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the psalm, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." Here the Sonship assigned to "the Christ" in the second psalm is regarded as exhibited in the Resurrection. From this review of St. Paul's usage it may be inferred that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the text before us carries with it in his own mind the idea of pre-existent eternal Sonship, though what we may call Messianic Sonship may be all he means distinctly to intimate as declared by prophets. The bearing of this distinction on the interpretation of ver. 4 will appear under it. It may be observed here that the absence of a fixed and definite usage in the application of the term "Son" to Christ, which (as has been seen) is found in the New Testament, is what might be expected there. Formal definitions of theological conceptions by means of language used uniformly in a recognized definite sense had not as yet been made. Among such conceptions that of the Holy Trinity though implied, is nowhere distinctly formulated as a dogma. It was reserved for the Church, under the guidance of the Spirit, to preclude misconception by precise dogmatic definitions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The doctrine of which the apostle Paul wrote, set forth the fulfilment of the promises by the prophets. It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
