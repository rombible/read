It seems suggested here by the previous <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, being (we may suppose) used commonly of the <span class="accented">delatores</span> who are known to have been a special pest of society at that period of Roman history. Alford quotes Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 6:7, where they are called "Principi quidem grati, et <span class="accented">Deo exosi</span>;" also Philo, 'Ap Damascen.,' <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>. In ver. 31 the collocation of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> seems to have been suggested by similarity of sound, there being no apparent link of ideas. The latter word is rightly translated in the Authorized Version, as is also <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x20;&#x20;&#x20;</span> being one who breaks treaties, "faithless;" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, one who refuses to enter into a truce or treaty, "implacable." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-32 In the horrid depravity of the heathen, the truth of our Lord's words was shown: Light was come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil; for he that doeth evil hateth the light. The truth was not to their taste. And we all know how soon a man will contrive, against the strongest evidence, to reason himself out of the belief of what he dislikes. But a man cannot be brought to greater slavery than to be given up to his own lusts. As the Gentiles did not like to keep God in their knowledge, they committed crimes wholly against reason and their own welfare. The nature of man, whether pagan or Christian, is still the same; and the charges of the apostle apply more or less to the state and character of men at all times, till they are brought to full submission to the faith of Christ, and renewed by Divine power. There never yet was a man, who had not reason to lament his strong corruptions, and his secret dislike to the will of God. Therefore this chapter is a call to self-examination, the end of which should be, a deep conviction of sin, and of the necessity of deliverance from a state of condemnation.</body></html>
