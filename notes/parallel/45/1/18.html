The revelation of wrath is to be inferred from the actual condition--the degradation doubly degraded--in which sin leaves its votaries.<p><span class= "bld">From heaven.</span>--The wrath of God is revealed "from heaven," inasmuch as the state of things in which it is exhibited is the divinely-inflicted penalty for previous guilt.

Here the argumentation of the Epistle begins, the first position to be established being that all mankind without exception is guilty of sin before God, and therefore unable of itself to put in a plea of <span class="accented">righteousness.</span> This being proved, the need of the revelation of <span class="accented">God's righteousness</span>, announced in ver. 17, appears. "The wrath of God" is an expression with which we are familiar in the Bible, being one of those in which human emotions are attributed to God in accommodation to the exigencies of human thought. It denotes his essential holiness, his antagonism to sin, to which punishment is due. It expresses an idea as essential to our conception of the Divine righteousness as do the words, "love" and "mercy." Wrath, or indignation, against evil is as necessary to our ideal of a perfect <span class="accented">human</span> being as is love of good; and therefore we attribute wrath to the perfect Divine Being, using of necessity human terms for expressing our conception of the Divine attributes. When the Name of the LORD Was proclaimed before Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>, etc.), it was of One not only "merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth," but also "that will by no means clear the guilty." This last attribute is the same as what we mean by the Divine wrath. This "wrath of God" is said in the verse before us to be "revealed from heaven." How so? Is it in the gospel, as is God's righteousness (ver. 18)? Against this view is the change of expression - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x28;</span> as well as the fact that the gospel is not in itself a revelation of wrath, but the very opposite. Is it in the Old Testament? Possibly in part; but the marked repetition of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the present tense seems to point to some obvious revelation <span class="accented">now</span>; and, further, the first part of the proof, to the end of the second chapter, does not rest on the Old Testament. Is it what the apostle proceeds so forcibly to draw attention to - the existing, and at that time notorious, moral degradation of heathen society, which he regards as evidence of Divine judgment? This may have been before his view; and, as he goes on at once to speak of it, it probably was so prominently. But the revelation of Divine wrath against sin seems to imply more than this as the argument goes on, viz. the evident guilt before God of all mankind alike, and not only of degraded heathenism. It is difficult to decide, among the various explanations that have been offered, on any specific mode of revelation which the writer had in view. Perhaps no particular one exclusively. Commentators may be often unduly anxious to affix an exact sense to pregnant words used by St. Paul, who so often indicates comprehensive ideas by short phrases. He may have had before his mind various concurrent signs of human guilt, and the Divine wrath against it, at that especial time of the world's history; all which, to his mind at least, brought conviction as by a light from heaven. And the gospel itself (though in its essence a revelation of mercy, so that he purposely avoids saying that wrath was in it revealed) still had been the most powerful means of all for bringing home a conviction of the Divine wrath to the consciences of believers. For its first office is to convince of sin and of judgment. Cf. the words of the forerunner, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" On all such grounds we may conceive that the apostle spoke of the wrath of God against human sin being especially at that time plainly revealed from heaven; and he desires to bring his readers to perceive it as he did. For now was the time of the Divine purpose to bring it home to all (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, "The times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent"). "All ungodliness and unrighteousness' (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) comprehends all evil-doing, in whatever aspect viewed, whether as impiety or as wrong. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, is wrongly translated in the Authorized Version, "who hold the truth." If the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> allowed this rendering here, it would indeed be intelligible in reference to the knowledge of God, even by nature, which all men have or ought to have, though they do not act upon it, and the very potential possession of which renders them guilty. This is the thought of what immediately follows. Thus the sense would be, "They <span class="accented">hold</span>, i.e. possess, the truth; but they do unrighteousness." But whenever <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to hold," it denotes a firm hold, not a loose hold, such as would be thus implied. It occurs in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a> ("I praise you that ye <span class="accented">keep</span> the ordinances"). and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a> ("<span class="accented">Hold fast</span> that which is good"). We must, therefore, have recourse to a second sense in which the verb is also used - that of "keeping back," or "restraining." Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-42.htm">Luke 4:42</a> ("The people <span class="accented">stayed</span> him, that he should not depart from them") and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a> ("Ye know what <span class="accented">withholdeth"</span>). The reference is still to the innate knowledge of God which all men are supposed to have had originally; but the idea expressed is not their <span class="accented">having</span> it, but their <span class="accented">suppressing</span> it. "Veritas in mente nititur et urget: sed homo eam impedit" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of the gospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape his wrath by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.</body></html>
