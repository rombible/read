"Not to be high-minded beyond that which he ought to be minded, but to be minded unto sober-mindedness." Our words, "to be minded," "high-minded," &c., very nearly express the sense of the Greek, which is to have the thoughts and feelings habitually turned in a certain direction. This is brought out with emphatic repetition in the phrase "to be minded unto the being sober-minded," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to keep sobriety of mind constantly in view as the object or ideal towards which all the thoughts and feelings converge.<p><span class= "bld">According as God hath dealt to every man.</span>--The standard of action which each Christian ought to propose to himself should be in proportion to the amount of his faith as given to him by God. He who has the strongest faith may assume the highest standard, and offer himself for the highest offices, and so on down the scale. It is, however, essential that the estimate which each man puts upon the strength of his own faith, should be thoroughly single-minded and sincere, nor biased by self-love. The Apostle assumes that this will be the case.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I say, through the grace given unto me</span> (the grace of apostleship to the Gentiles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>). He is about to warn against either neglecting or exceeding the special graces given to each person; and he may, perhaps, mean to imply here that he himself, in giving these admonitions, is exercising, without exceeding, his own special grace) <span class="cmt_word">to every man that is among you</span> (this is emphatic. The pretensions to superiority of some at Corinth who possessed more showy gifts than others had shown how the admonition might need to be pressed on all; and in a community like that of the Romans there might well be a special tendency to assumption on the part of some), <span class="cmt_word">not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly</span> (rather, as in the Revised Version <span class="accented">so to think as to think soberly</span>, or, more literally, <span class="accented">to be minded so as to be sober-minded</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</span>. Why <span class="accented">of faith?</span> One might have expected the expression to be, "of grace," as in ver. 6, "according to the grace that is given to us;" or as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7</a>, "according to the measure [<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as here] of the <span class="accented">gift</span> of Christ." It seems to be because by faith we become <span class="accented">receptive</span> of the grace given to each of us. Hence the faith assigned by God to each is regarded as "the regulative standard; the subjective condition" (Meyer)of the several gifts or graces. Cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>, where miraculous powers are spoken of as dependent on the amount of faith. Tholuck explains thus: "Faith in an unseen Christ brings man into connection with a world unseen, in which he moves without distinctly apprehending it; and in proportion as he learns to look with faith to that world, the more is the measure of his spiritual powers elevated." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:3-8 Pride is a sin in us by nature; we need to be cautioned and armed against it. All the saints make up one body in Christ, who is the Head of the body, and the common Centre of their unity. In the spiritual body, some are fitted for and called to one sort of work; others for another sort of work. We are to do all the good we can, one to another, and for the common benefit. If we duly thought about the powers we have, and how far we fail properly to improve them, it would humble us. But as we must not be proud of our talents, so we must take heed lest, under a pretence of humility and self-denial, we are slothful in laying out ourselves for the good of others. We must not say, I am nothing, therefore I will sit still, and do nothing; but, I am nothing in myself, and therefore I will lay out myself to the utmost, in the strength of the grace of Christ. Whatever our gifts or situations may be, let us try to employ ourselves humbly, diligently, cheerfully, and in simplicity; not seeking our own credit or profit, but the good of many, for this world and that which is to come.</body></html>
