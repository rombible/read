All Christians, viewed collectively, make up one body, the unity of which is supplied by their relation to Christ. Viewed individually, they stand to each other in the same sort of relation as the different limbs and organs of the natural body, as foot and hand, or hand and eye.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Members in one body.</span>--This figure of the body and the members is worked out more fully in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.">1Corinthians 12:12-27</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office; so we, the many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another</span>. The illustration of the body with its members to set forth the mutual dependence on each other of the several members of the Church with their several gifts and functions, and the importance of all for the well-being of the whole, is further carried out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a> and Ephesians 4:15, 16, Christ is regarded, somewhat differently, as the exalted Head over the Church which is his body. Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, the head is not thus distinguished from the rest of the body (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-21.htm">1 Corinthians 12:21</a>); the whole is "one body in Christ," who is the living Person who unites and animates it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:3-8 Pride is a sin in us by nature; we need to be cautioned and armed against it. All the saints make up one body in Christ, who is the Head of the body, and the common Centre of their unity. In the spiritual body, some are fitted for and called to one sort of work; others for another sort of work. We are to do all the good we can, one to another, and for the common benefit. If we duly thought about the powers we have, and how far we fail properly to improve them, it would humble us. But as we must not be proud of our talents, so we must take heed lest, under a pretence of humility and self-denial, we are slothful in laying out ourselves for the good of others. We must not say, I am nothing, therefore I will sit still, and do nothing; but, I am nothing in myself, and therefore I will lay out myself to the utmost, in the strength of the grace of Christ. Whatever our gifts or situations may be, let us try to employ ourselves humbly, diligently, cheerfully, and in simplicity; not seeking our own credit or profit, but the good of many, for this world and that which is to come.</body></html>
