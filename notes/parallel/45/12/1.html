In the first two verses of the chapter he speaks of this in general terms, but then goes on to give a number of special precepts in no very distinct arrangement or order.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore.</span>--We may well believe that the Apostle having brought his argument up to a climax at the close of the last chapter, would make a pause in his dictation, and perhaps not resume it until another sitting. The one prevailing impression left on his mind, both by the argument just ended and by the whole previous portion of the Epistle, is a profound sense of the merciful and benevolent purposes of God, who, out of seeming evil, only educes the highest good. This sense is still strong upon him, and he makes it the link of transition by which the earnest practical exhortations which follow are bound to what precedes. The sequence is as much one of feeling as of ratiocination.<p><span class= "bld">Your bodies.</span>--Not merely a periphrasis for "yourselves," but in the strict sense "your bodies," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the very part of you which is apt to be "an occasion of falling." The Apostle takes the two main parts of human nature separately. In this verse he deals with the bodies of men, in the next verse with the "mind," or the intellectual and spiritual faculties.<p><span class= "bld">A living sacrifice</span>.--"How is the body to become a sacrifice? Let thine eye look upon no evil thing, and it hath become a sacrifice; let thy tongue speak nothing filthy, and it hath become an offering; let thy hand do no lawless deed, and it hath become a whole burnt offering. But this is not enough, we must do good works also; let the hand do alms, the mouth bless them that despitefully use us, and the ear find leisure evermore for <span class= "ital">the</span> hearing of Scripture. For sacrifice can be made only of that which is clean; sacrifice is a firstfruit of other actions. Let us, then, from our hands, and feet, and mouth, and all our other members, yield a firstfruit unto God" (St. Chrysostom).<p>The idea contained in sacrifice is that of dedication. We are to <span class= "ital">dedicate</span> our bodies to God. But there is to be this distinction between the old Jewish sacrifices and the Christian sacrifice: the one was of dead animals, the other of the living man. The worshipper must offer, or present, before God, <span class= "ital">himself,</span> with all his living energies and powers directed consciously to God's service.<p><span class= "bld">Holy, acceptable unto God.</span>--The qualification sought for in the Jewish sacrifices was that they were to be unblemished, without spot. In like manner the Christian's sacrifice must be holy and pure in God's sight, otherwise it cannot be acceptable to Him.<p><span class= "bld">Reasonable service.</span>--The English phrase is somewhat ambiguous. It might mean "a service <span class= "ital">demanded</span> by reason." Such, however is not the sense of the Greek, but rather "a service <span class= "ital">of</span> the reason," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a service <span class= "ital">rendered</span> by the reason. Just as under the old dispensation the mind expressed its devotion through the ritual of sacrifice, so now under the new dispensation its worship takes the form of a self-dedication; its service consists in holiness of life, temperance, soberness, and chastity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>. - III. HORTATORY. (See summary of contents, p. 17.) It is St. Paul's way to supplement his doctrinal treatises with detailed practical directions as to the conduct that should of necessity ensue on belief in the doctrines propounded. So also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>, etc., where, as here, he connects his exhortations with what has gone before by the initiatory <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>. Beyond his exposition of the truth for its own sake, he has always a further practical aim. Saving faith is ever with him a living faith, to be shown by its fruits. Nor, according to him, will these fruits follow, unless the believer himself does his part in cultivating them: else were these earnest and particular exhortations needless. If, on the one hand, he is the great assertor of our salvation being through faith and all of grace, he is no less distinct for the necessity of works following, and of the power of man's free-will to use or resist grace; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>, where, speaking of himself, he does not mean to say that grace had made him what he was in spite of himself, but that grace had not been in vain, because he himself had worked with grace. All was of grace, but he himself had laboured, assisted by grace working with him. It will be observed how comprehensive is the survey of Christian duty that here follows, reaching to all the relations of life, as well as to internal disposition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>. - E. <span class="accented">Various practical duties enforced.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beseech you therefore, brethren</span> (he does not command, as did Moses in the Law; he beseeches; he is but a fellow-servant, with his brethren, of Christ; he does not "lord it over God's heritage" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-3.htm">1 Peter 5:3</a>), but trusts that they will of their own accord respond to "the mercies of God" in Christ, which he has set before them), <span class="cmt_word">by the mercies of God</span> ("Qui misericordia Dei recte movetur in omnem Dei <span class="accented">voluntatem</span> ingreditur. At anima irae obnoxia vix quiddam juvatur adhortationibus," Bengel), <span class="cmt_word">that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service</span>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is the usual one for the <span class="accented">presenting</span> of sacrificial animals at the altar (Xen., 'Anab.,' 6:1.22; Lucian, 'De Sacrif.,' 13. The LXX in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7, 10</a>, has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 28</a>, and <span class="accented">supra, 6:</span>13). <span class="accented">Our bodies</span> are here specified, with probable reference to the bodies of victims which were offered in the old ritual. But our offering differs from them in being "a <span class="accented">living</span> sacrifice," replete with life and energy to do God's will (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6, 7, 8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5, 6, 7</a>), yea, and oven inspired with a new life - a life from the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>). Further, the thought is suggested of the abuse of the body to uncleanness prevalent in heathen society (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>). The bodies of Christians are "members of Christ," "temples of the Holy Ghost," consecrated to God, and to be devoted to his service (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>, etc.); and not in heart only, but in actual life, of which the body is the agent, we are to offer ourselves, after the example of Christ. <span class="accented">Your reasonable service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) must be taken in apposition to "present your bodies, rather than to "sacrifice," it being the act of offering, and not the thing offered. that constitutes the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This word is especially used for the ceremonial worship of the Old Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-25.htm">Exodus 12:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-1.htm">Hebrews 9:1, 6, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>), the counterpart of which in Christians is, according to St. Paul, not ceremonial service, but rather that of a devoted life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; Hebrews 41:28). The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> has been variously understood. It probably means <span class="accented">rational</span>, denoting a moral and spiritual serving of God, in implied opposition to mechanical acts of outward worship. "Respectu intellectus et voluntatis" (Bengel). It may be taken to express the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>), and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). Though the offering of the body is being spoken of, yet "bodily self-sacrifice is an <span class="accented">ethical</span> act" (Meyer). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>. The word itself occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>, where its meaning, though obscure, may be similar. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1,2 The apostle having closed the part of his epistle wherein he argues and proves various doctrines which are practically applied, here urges important duties from gospel principles. He entreated the Romans, as his brethren in Christ, by the mercies of God, to present their bodies as a living sacrifice to Him. This is a powerful appeal. We receive from the Lord every day the fruits of his mercy. Let us render ourselves; all we are, all we have, all we can do: and after all, what return is it for such very rich receivings? It is acceptable to God: a reasonable service, which we are able and ready to give a reason for, and which we understand. Conversion and sanctification are the renewing of the mind; a change, not of the substance, but of the qualities of the soul. The progress of sanctification, dying to sin more and more, and living to righteousness more and more, is the carrying on this renewing work, till it is perfected in glory. The great enemy to this renewal is, conformity to this world. Take heed of forming plans for happiness, as though it lay in the things of this world, which soon pass away. Do not fall in with the customs of those who walk in the lusts of the flesh, and mind earthly things. The work of the Holy Ghost first begins in the understanding, and is carried on to the will, affections, and conversation, till there is a change of the whole man into the likeness of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness. Thus, to be godly, is to give up ourselves to God.</body></html>
