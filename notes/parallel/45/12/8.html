This last form of address, corresponding perhaps rather to our word "encouragement," would be especially needed in the troubled circumstances of the early Church.<p><span class= "bld">He that giveth.</span>--In this and the following phrases the Apostle passes on from considering the definite functions of the ministry to those which were common to all members of the Church; "giveth" is therefore here to be taken in a wide sense.<p><span class= "bld">Simplicity.</span>--With singleness of motive, desiring only God's glory, and to benefit the object for which he gives, and with no secret thought of self-exaltation. He who gives "to be seen of men," or with any selfish motive, exhausts thereby the merit of the act, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm" title="Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span><p><span class= "bld">He that ruleth.</span>--He who holds any position of prominence or importance in the Church. The same word is applied to "presbyters" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1Thessalonians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1Timothy 5:17</a>; and to heads of families in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/3-4.htm" title="One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;">1Timothy 3:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.">1Timothy 3:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</span>--A happy combination which is an instance of the Apostle's fresh and genuine view of human nature. The kindness of charity is doubled when it is done in a cheerful and kindly way. There is a class of religious minds which is especially apt to forget this. Cheerfulness is not merely a matter of temperament, but to be cultivated as a duty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:3-8 Pride is a sin in us by nature; we need to be cautioned and armed against it. All the saints make up one body in Christ, who is the Head of the body, and the common Centre of their unity. In the spiritual body, some are fitted for and called to one sort of work; others for another sort of work. We are to do all the good we can, one to another, and for the common benefit. If we duly thought about the powers we have, and how far we fail properly to improve them, it would humble us. But as we must not be proud of our talents, so we must take heed lest, under a pretence of humility and self-denial, we are slothful in laying out ourselves for the good of others. We must not say, I am nothing, therefore I will sit still, and do nothing; but, I am nothing in myself, and therefore I will lay out myself to the utmost, in the strength of the grace of Christ. Whatever our gifts or situations may be, let us try to employ ourselves humbly, diligently, cheerfully, and in simplicity; not seeking our own credit or profit, but the good of many, for this world and that which is to come.</body></html>
