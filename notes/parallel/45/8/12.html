True, the "deeds" spoken of are, in fact, those of <span class="accented">the flesh</span>; but the body is regarded as the organ of the lusts of the flesh, and it is fitly named here in connection with the thought of the preceding verses. The word translated. "deeds" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, denoting, not single acts, but rather <span class="accented">doings -</span> the general outcome in action of fleshly lusts using the body as their organ. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, viewed in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 11, seem to point ultimately to the result hereafter of the two courses of life denoted: but not, it would seem, exclusively; for our future state is constantly regarded by the apostle as the continuance and sequence of what is begun in us already - whether of life in Christ now unto life eternal, or of death in sin now unto death beyond the grave. The general idea may be stated thus: If ye live after the flesh, the power in you to which you give your allegiance and adhesion will involve you in its own doom, death; but if ye live after the Spirit, you identify yourselves with the Spirit of life that is in you, whereby you will be emancipated at last even from these your mortal bodies, whose doings you already slay. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:10-17 If the Spirit be in us, Christ is in us. He dwells in the heart by faith. Grace in the soul is its new nature; the soul is alive to God, and has begun its holy happiness which shall endure for ever. The righteousness of Christ imputed, secures the soul, the better part, from death. From hence we see how much it is our duty to walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. If any habitually live according to corrupt lustings, they will certainly perish in their sins, whatever they profess. And what can a worldly life present, worthy for a moment to be put against this noble prize of our high calling? Let us then, by the Spirit, endeavour more and more to mortify the flesh. Regeneration by the Holy Spirit brings a new and Divine life to the soul, though in a feeble state. And the sons of God have the Spirit to work in them the disposition of children; they have not the spirit of bondage, which the Old Testament church was under, through the darkness of that dispensation. The Spirit of adoption was not then plentifully poured out. Also it refers to that spirit of bondage, under which many saints were at their conversion. Many speak peace to themselves, to whom God does not speak peace. But those who are sanctified, have God's Spirit witnessing with their spirits, in and by his speaking peace to the soul. Though we may now seem to be losers for Christ, we shall not, we cannot, be losers by him in the end.</body></html>
