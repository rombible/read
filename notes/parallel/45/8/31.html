Observe that the word here is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> as in ver. 28. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-14.htm">Matthew 22:14</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. Many may be <span class="accented">called</span> to a state of salvation, but not all of them <span class="accented">chosen</span> finally, as fulfilling the purpose of their calling.) It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. A different punctuation of these two verses is preferred by some, and seems more natural and more forcible; thus: Who <span class="accented">shall charge God's elect? God who justifieth? Who is he that condemneth? Christ who died?</span> etc. A similar answering a question by asking another is found below in ver. 35. The further thought is thus implied that, if neither God charges, nor Christ, the Judge, condemns, who can do either? The apostle next goes on to say that, there being none to charge and condemn us at last, so also there is none that can <span class="accented">remove</span> us from our state of acceptance now. For who or what can possibly prove stronger than Christ's love, which has called us to it? The enumeration that follows of things that might possibly be supposed to remove us shows again that it is not our own sins, but external circumstances of trial, that are being viewed all along as powerless to hinder our salvation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:28-31 That is good for the saints which does their souls good. Every providence tends to the spiritual good of those that love God; in breaking them off from sin, bringing them nearer to God, weaning them from the world, and fitting them for heaven. When the saints act out of character, corrections will be employed to bring them back again. And here is the order of the causes of our salvation, a golden chain, one which cannot be broken. 1. Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son. All that God designed for glory and happiness as the end, he decreed to grace and holiness as the way. The whole human race deserved destruction; but for reasons not perfectly known to us, God determined to recover some by regeneration and the power of his grace. He predestinated, or before decreed, that they should be conformed to the image of his Son. In this life they are in part renewed, and walk in his steps. 2. Whom he did predestinate, them he also called. It is an effectual call, from self and earth to God, and Christ, and heaven, as our end; from sin and vanity to grace and holiness, as our way. This is the gospel call. The love of God, ruling in the hearts of those who once were enemies to him, proves that they have been called according to his purpose. 3. Whom he called, them he also justified. None are thus justified but those that are effectually called. Those who stand out against the gospel call, abide under guilt and wrath. 4. Whom he justified, them he also glorified. The power of corruption being broken in effectual calling, and the guilt of sin removed in justification, nothing can come between that soul and glory. This encourages our faith and hope; for, as for God, his way, his work, is perfect. The apostle speaks as one amazed, and swallowed up in admiration, wondering at the height and depth, and length and breadth, of the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge. The more we know of other things, the less we wonder; but the further we are led into gospel mysteries, the more we are affected by them. While God is for us, and we keep in his love, we may with holy boldness defy all the powers of darkness.</body></html>
