Because hope in the future is of the very essence of the Christian's life. It was by hope that he was saved. Hope, at the time when he first believed, made him realise his salvation, though it is still in the future. This is, indeed, implied in the very nature of hope. Its proper object is that which is future and unseen.<p><span class= "bld">By hope.</span>--It is usually faith rather than hope that is represented as the means or instrument of salvation. Nor can it quite rightly be said that hope is <span class= "ital">an aspect</span> of faith, because faith and hope are expressly distinguished and placed as co-ordinate with each other in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1Corinthians 13:13</a> : "and now abideth faith, hope, and charity, these three." Hope is rather a secondary cause of salvation, because it sets salvation vividly before the believer, and so makes him strive to obtain it.<p>It must not, however, be overlooked that the phrase translated "by hope," may be taken, rather to mean <span class= "ital">"with"</span> or <span class= "ital">"in</span> hope." It will then serve to limit the idea of salvation. We were saved, indeed, in an inchoate and imperfect manner, but our full salvation is still a subject for hope, and therefore it is not past but still in the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For by</span> (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hope we were saved</span>; not <span class="accented">are saved, as</span> in the Authorized Version. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 15, points to the time of conversion. The dative <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>, which has no preposition before it, seems here, to have a <span class="accented">modal</span> rather than <span class="accented">medial</span> sense; for faith, not hope, is that <span class="accented">whereby</span> we are ever said to be saved. The meaning is that when the state of salvation was entered upon, hope was an essential element in its appropriation. A condition, not of attainment, but of hope, is therefore the normal condition of the regenerate now; and so, after shortly pointing out the very meaning of hope, the apostle enforces his previous conclusion, that they must be content at present to wait with patience. <span class="cmt_word">But hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it</span>. Now comes in a further thought, and a very interesting one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:18-25 The sufferings of the saints strike no deeper than the things of time, last no longer than the present time, are light afflictions, and but for a moment. How vastly different are the sentence of the word and the sentiment of the world, concerning the sufferings of this present time! Indeed the whole creation seems to wait with earnest expectation for the period when the children of God shall be manifested in the glory prepared for them. There is an impurity, deformity, and infirmity, which has come upon the creature by the fall of man. There is an enmity of one creature to another. And they are used, or abused rather, by men as instruments of sin. Yet this deplorable state of the creation is in hope. God will deliver it from thus being held in bondage to man's depravity. The miseries of the human race, through their own and each other's wickedness, declare that the world is not always to continue as it is. Our having received the first-fruits of the Spirit, quickens our desires, encourages our hopes, and raises our expectations. Sin has been, and is, the guilty cause of all the suffering that exists in the creation of God. It has brought on the woes of earth; it has kindled the flames of hell. As to man, not a tear has been shed, not a groan has been uttered, not a pang has been felt, in body or mind, that has not come from sin. This is not all; sin is to be looked at as it affects the glory of God. Of this how fearfully regardless are the bulk of mankind! Believers have been brought into a state of safety; but their comfort consists rather in hope than in enjoyment. From this hope they cannot be turned by the vain expectation of finding satisfaction in the things of time and sense. We need patience, our way is rough and long; but He that shall come, will come, though he seems to tarry.</body></html>
