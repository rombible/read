Some readings give <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> before, and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> after, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies, through his Spirit that dwelleth in you</span>. These verses have been variously understood. It has been supposed by some that ver. 10 continues the thought of ver. 9; "the body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) meaning the same as "the flesh (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>),and dead (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) meaning <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. mortified</span>, or lifeless with respect to the power of sin that was in it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Thus the meaning of the first clause of ver. 10 would be, "If Christ be in you, the body of sin in you is dead; but you are alive in the Spirit." Decisive objections to this view are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by itself is not elsewhere used as an equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, but as denoting our mere <span class="accented">bodily</span> organization. This statement is consistent with the metaphorical application of the word sometimes in a different verse, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, above quoted, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>. Observe also <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 11, which can hardly be taken but as expressing what is intended here; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with the accusative (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) cannot be forced out of its proper meaning of "<span class="accented">because</span> of," which, according to the view we are considering, would be unintelligible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that ver. 11, which is obviously connected in thought with ver. 10, cannot well be brought into tune with it according to the view proposed. All is made clear, in view both of language and of context, by taking these two verses as introducing a new thought, which is carried out afterwards in ver. 18, viz. that of the drawback to the full enjoyment and development of our spiritual life owing to the mortal bodies which clothe us now and the purpose is to bid us believe in the reality of our redemption, and persevere in correspondent life, notwithstanding such present drawback. Thus the idea is that, though in our present earthly state the mortal body is death-stricken in consequence of sin (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) - subject to the doom of Adam, that extended to all his race (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, etc.) - yet, Christ being in us now, the same Divine Spirit that raised him from the dead will in us too at last overcome mortality. cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the same word as in ver. 11 here); and compare also all that follows in that chapter. This view of the meaning of the passage before us is strongly confirmed by our finding, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-5:6</a>, exactly the same idea carried out at length, with a correspondence also of the language used. The frail, mortal, ever-dying earthen vessels, in which we have now the treasure of our life in Christ, are there regarded as crippling the expansion of our spiritual life, and causing us to "groan, being burdened" (cf. in the chapter before us, ver. 23, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); but the very consciousness of this higher life within him, yearning so for an adequate and deathless organism, assures the apostle that God has one in store for him, having already given him "the earnest of the Spirit." And this seems to be what is meant hereby "shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." As to particular expressions in the verses before us, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, applied to "the <span class="accented">body</span>," may be taken to mean <span class="accented">infected with death, and doomed to it</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a> - <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> opposition to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, given as the reason for the Spirit being life, may be explained with reference to the essential conception of <span class="accented">righteousness</span> throughout the Epistle, as God's <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, revealed in Christ, and made over to man as the remedy of human sin. Before carrying out the thought peculiarly suggested by the last two verses (as is done at ver. 18), the apostle now draws a conclusion (expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) from what has been so far said, so as to press the more the obligation of a spiritual <span class="accented">life</span> in Christians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:10-17 If the Spirit be in us, Christ is in us. He dwells in the heart by faith. Grace in the soul is its new nature; the soul is alive to God, and has begun its holy happiness which shall endure for ever. The righteousness of Christ imputed, secures the soul, the better part, from death. From hence we see how much it is our duty to walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. If any habitually live according to corrupt lustings, they will certainly perish in their sins, whatever they profess. And what can a worldly life present, worthy for a moment to be put against this noble prize of our high calling? Let us then, by the Spirit, endeavour more and more to mortify the flesh. Regeneration by the Holy Spirit brings a new and Divine life to the soul, though in a feeble state. And the sons of God have the Spirit to work in them the disposition of children; they have not the spirit of bondage, which the Old Testament church was under, through the darkness of that dispensation. The Spirit of adoption was not then plentifully poured out. Also it refers to that spirit of bondage, under which many saints were at their conversion. Many speak peace to themselves, to whom God does not speak peace. But those who are sanctified, have God's Spirit witnessing with their spirits, in and by his speaking peace to the soul. Though we may now seem to be losers for Christ, we shall not, we cannot, be losers by him in the end.</body></html>
