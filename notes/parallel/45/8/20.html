Creation is fulfilling an unworthy instead of a worthy and noble end. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;">Genesis 3:17-18</a>.) It was made subject to this "not willingly," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by its own act or with its own concurrence, but "by reason of Him who hath subjected the same," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in pursuance of the sovereign purpose and counsel of God. The one thing which takes out the sting from this impoverished and degraded condition is Hope.<p>It is needless to say that this is not Darwinism, but it is easily reconcilable with evolution. Indeed, such a theory seems to give it additional force and emphasis. It helps to bring out both the present "vanity" and hope for the future, and to show both as parts of one "increasing purpose" widening through the ages. "Allowing for irregularities and fluctuations, on the whole, higher and higher forms of life have appeared. There has been unquestionably an enormous advance between the times of the Eozoon Canadense and our own. And, further, we have to notice that a new kind of progress, of far greater intrinsic importance than mere physical improvement, has of late appeared. I mean intellectual and moral progress, as it is seen in man. . . . And this progress, I would say, is most important in our argument as to the character of God, for it is full of promise of far better things than this sad world has ever seen. It points most decidedly to a supremacy of the power for good, and a great hope of final happiness for our race." (Rev. S. T. Gibson, <span class= "ital">Religion and Science,</span> p. 34.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the creature</span> (or, <span class="accented">creation</span>, as before) <span class="cmt_word">was subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who subjected it in hope. Because</span> (or, that; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">in hope that</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the creature</span> (or, <span class="accented">creation</span>) <span class="cmt_word">also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God</span>. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> ("was subjected") seems to imply that the present "vanity" and "bondage of corruption" were not inherent in the original Creation, or of necessity to last for ever. Thus the assertions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>: and 31, stand unshaken, viz. that in the beginning God created all things, and that all at first was "very good." The ideas, resorted to in order to account for existing evil, of matter (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>) being essentially evil, and of a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, other than the Supreme God, having made the world, are alike precluded. It might serve as an answer to the argument of Lucretius against a Divine origin of things- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Nequaquam nobis divinius esse paratam<br />Naturam rerum, tanta star praedita culpa"</span> Why the "creature" was thus "subjected" is not here explained. No solution of the old insoluble problem of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> is given. All that is, or could be, said is that it was <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, meaning God. It was his will that it should be so; this is all we know; except that we find the beginning of evil, so far as it affects man, attributed in Scripture to human sin. But he so subjected his creation <span class="accented">in hope.</span> This expression may refer to the <span class="accented">protoevangelium</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, or to the never-dying hope in the human heart; to either or to both. The latter idea is expressed in the myth of Pandora's box. Further, the creature is said to have been so subjected "not willingly" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). No sentient beings acquiesce in suffering; they resent evil, and would fain flee from it. Man especially unwillingly submits to his present bondage. When in ver. 21 the hope is expressed of the creature (or creation) itself being eventually freed from the present bondage of corruption, it may be that the human part of creation only is in the writer's eye; but it may be also (there being still no expressed limitation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) that he conceives a final emancipation of the whole creation from evil (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). But if so, it is not said that the peculiar glory of the sons of God will extend to all creation, but only that all will be freed into the freedom of their glory; which may mean that the day of the revelation of the sons of God in glory will bring with it a general emancipation of all creation from its present bondage. Such a great final hope finds expression in the verse - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"That God, which ever lives and loves,<br />One God, one law, one element,<br />And one far-off Divine event,<br />To which the whole creation moves."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">In Memoriam.'</span>) The present condition of things is in ver. 20 denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and in ver. 21 by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. The first of these words is the equivalent in the LXX. of the Hebrew XXX, which means properly "breath," or "vapour," and is used metaphorically for anything frail, fruitless, evanescent, vain. It is often applied to idols, and it is the word in Ecclesiastes where it is said that "all is vanity" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5, 6</a>). It seems here to denote the frailty, incompleteness, transitoriness, to which all things are now subject. "<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> sonat frustatio, quod creatura interim non assequatur quod utcunque contendit efficere" (Erasmus). <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> intimates corruption and decay. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:18-25 The sufferings of the saints strike no deeper than the things of time, last no longer than the present time, are light afflictions, and but for a moment. How vastly different are the sentence of the word and the sentiment of the world, concerning the sufferings of this present time! Indeed the whole creation seems to wait with earnest expectation for the period when the children of God shall be manifested in the glory prepared for them. There is an impurity, deformity, and infirmity, which has come upon the creature by the fall of man. There is an enmity of one creature to another. And they are used, or abused rather, by men as instruments of sin. Yet this deplorable state of the creation is in hope. God will deliver it from thus being held in bondage to man's depravity. The miseries of the human race, through their own and each other's wickedness, declare that the world is not always to continue as it is. Our having received the first-fruits of the Spirit, quickens our desires, encourages our hopes, and raises our expectations. Sin has been, and is, the guilty cause of all the suffering that exists in the creation of God. It has brought on the woes of earth; it has kindled the flames of hell. As to man, not a tear has been shed, not a groan has been uttered, not a pang has been felt, in body or mind, that has not come from sin. This is not all; sin is to be looked at as it affects the glory of God. Of this how fearfully regardless are the bulk of mankind! Believers have been brought into a state of safety; but their comfort consists rather in hope than in enjoyment. From this hope they cannot be turned by the vain expectation of finding satisfaction in the things of time and sense. We need patience, our way is rough and long; but He that shall come, will come, though he seems to tarry.</body></html>
