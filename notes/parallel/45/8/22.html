It groans and travails <span class= "ital">together, i.e.,</span> every member of it in common with its kind. The idea of travailing, as in childbirth, has reference to the future prospect of joyful delivery. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm" title="A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.">John 16:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Until now.</span>--This consciousness of pain and imperfection has been continuous and unbroken (nor will it cease until an end is put to it by the Coming of Christ.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only so, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body</span>. The present unwilling subjection of the whole visible creation to evil is here still more forcibly expressed, and spoken of as being what is known - a subject of experience to all who observe and think; and it is added that this state of things continues still - it is "until now." The yearned-for deliverance has not yet come; and therefore we should not be surprised if we too, the regenerate, while in the body, are not yet exempt from our share in the universal groaning. For we have but the <span class="accented">first fruits</span> of the Spirit as yet, not its full triumph; cf. "the <span class="accented">earnest</span> of the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>), and "the <span class="accented">earnest</span> of our inheritance " (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>). Its being said that we still wait for our adoption as sons is not inconsistent with other statements (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5-7</a>, and above, ver. 14, etc.), to the effect that we are already adopted, and are already sons; for <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here denotes the final realization of our present sonship, when the sons of' God shall be <span class="accented">revealed</span> (ver. 19). Similarly, our redemption (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is here regarded as future. In one sense we are redeemed already; in another we await our redemption, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the full accomplishment thereof. It is the consummation called by our Lord <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>), and by St. Peter, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>). cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>, and Revelation generally. "Of our body" seems to be added with reference to what has been seen above as to our present "mortal bodies" being both the organs of the lust of the flesh and the hindrances to the proper development of our inward spiritual life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:18-25 The sufferings of the saints strike no deeper than the things of time, last no longer than the present time, are light afflictions, and but for a moment. How vastly different are the sentence of the word and the sentiment of the world, concerning the sufferings of this present time! Indeed the whole creation seems to wait with earnest expectation for the period when the children of God shall be manifested in the glory prepared for them. There is an impurity, deformity, and infirmity, which has come upon the creature by the fall of man. There is an enmity of one creature to another. And they are used, or abused rather, by men as instruments of sin. Yet this deplorable state of the creation is in hope. God will deliver it from thus being held in bondage to man's depravity. The miseries of the human race, through their own and each other's wickedness, declare that the world is not always to continue as it is. Our having received the first-fruits of the Spirit, quickens our desires, encourages our hopes, and raises our expectations. Sin has been, and is, the guilty cause of all the suffering that exists in the creation of God. It has brought on the woes of earth; it has kindled the flames of hell. As to man, not a tear has been shed, not a groan has been uttered, not a pang has been felt, in body or mind, that has not come from sin. This is not all; sin is to be looked at as it affects the glory of God. Of this how fearfully regardless are the bulk of mankind! Believers have been brought into a state of safety; but their comfort consists rather in hope than in enjoyment. From this hope they cannot be turned by the vain expectation of finding satisfaction in the things of time and sense. We need patience, our way is rough and long; but He that shall come, will come, though he seems to tarry.</body></html>
