It begins by imparting to him the Spirit of Christ; this Spirit creates within him a law; and the result of that law is life--that perfect spiritual vitality which includes within itself the pledge of immortality.<p><span class= "bld">The Spirit.</span>--That is, the Spirit of Christ, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>, which is hardly as yet conceived of as a distinct personality, but representing the continued action and influence which the ascended Saviour exercises upon the believer.<p><span class= "bld">In Christ Jesus.</span>--These words are best taken with "hath made" (rather, <span class= "ital">made,</span> when it was imparted to me) "me free." The law of the Spirit of life, in Christ (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> operating through my union with Christ), made me free from the law of sin and of death.<p><span class= "bld">From the law of sin and death.</span>--The direct contrast to the foregoing. Not here the law of Moses, but the power of sin, the corrupt element in our nature, acting upon the soul, and itself erecting a kind of law, saying, "Thou shalt," where the law of God says "Thou shalt not;" and "Thou shalt not," where the law of God says "Thou shalt." The effect of this reign of sin is death--spiritual death--bearing in itself the pledge of eternal death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free</span> (not <span class="accented">hath made me</span>; the aorist refers to the time when the Christian became possessed of the Spirit of life in Christ) from the law of sin and death. Here is a distinct contrast to the state described in vers. 14, 23 of ch. 7, and a realization of what was yearned for in ver. 24, "the law of sin and of death" being evidently "the law of sin in the members" previously spoken cf. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, before in captivity to this law, is now freed from it. And how? Not by its becoming a different <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>; not by a change of the constituent elements of human nature; but by the introduction of a new law - the law of the Spirit of life - which has emancipated the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> from its old unwelcome thraldom. In virtue of this new law, introduced into my being, I am now free to give my entire allegiance to the law of God. <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, be it observed, is here again used in a sense different from its usual one, and we thus have a still further <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in addition to those defined in the note after <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>. The designation of this new law is in marked opposition to that in which the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> was before said to be held; we have <span class="accented">life</span> in opposition to <span class="accented">death</span>, and the <span class="accented">Spirit</span> in opposition to the <span class="accented">flesh</span>, as well as <span class="accented">freedom</span> in opposition to <span class="accented">captivity.</span> The <span class="accented">Spirit</span> is, in fact, the Divine Spirit, taking possession of what is <span class="accented">spiritual</span> (now at length brought into view) in the <span class="accented">inward man</span>, making him partaker in the Divine <span class="accented">life</span>, and able to serve God <span class="accented">freely.</span> The expressions used bring out strikingly one essential distinction between Law and Gospel, viz. that the principle of the former is to control and discipline conduct by requirements and threats; but of the latter to introduce into man's inner being a new principle of life, whence right conduct may spontaneously flow. Coercion is the principle of the one; inspiration of the other. An illustration may be found in the treatment of disease - on the one hand by attempted repression of specific ailments, and on the other by imparting a new vitality to the system, which may of itself dispel disease. It is shown next how this new state of freedom has been brought about. First, by what God in Christ has done for us apart from ourselves; the subjective condition in ourselves being introduced at the end of ver. 4, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-9 Believers may be chastened of the Lord, but will not be condemned with the world. By their union with Christ through faith, they are thus secured. What is the principle of their walk; the flesh or the Spirit, the old or the new nature, corruption or grace? For which of these do we make provision, by which are we governed? The unrenewed will is unable to keep any commandment fully. And the law, besides outward duties, requires inward obedience. God showed abhorrence of sin by the sufferings of his Son in the flesh, that the believer's person might be pardoned and justified. Thus satisfaction was made to Divine justice, and the way of salvation opened for the sinner. By the Spirit the law of love is written upon the heart, and though the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by us, yet, blessed be God, it is fulfilled in us; there is that in all true believers, which answers the intention of the law. The favour of God, the welfare of the soul, the concerns of eternity, are the things of the Spirit, which those that are after the Spirit do mind. Which way do our thoughts move with most pleasure? Which way go our plans and contrivances? Are we most wise for the world, or for our souls? Those that live in pleasure are dead, 1Ti 5:6. A sanctified soul is a living soul; and that life is peace. The carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself. The carnal man may, by the power of Divine grace, be made subject to the law of God, but the carnal mind never can; that must be broken and driven out. We may know our real state and character by inquiring whether we have the Spirit of God and Christ, or not, ver. 9. Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit. Having the Spirit of Christ, means having a turn of mind in some degree like the mind that was in Christ Jesus, and is to be shown by a life and conversation suitable to his precepts and example.</body></html>
