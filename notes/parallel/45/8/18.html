A vivid impression of the stormy life of the Apostle at this period is given by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-4.htm" title="But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,">2Corinthians 6:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.">2Corinthians 11:23-28</a>. But he counted it as nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,">Philippians 3:8</a>) as compared with his triumphant out-look into the future. Here, then, there follows a statement of the nature of the Christian's hope viewed, not only as it affects the individual, but also in its cosmical aspect.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">Revealed in us.</span>--<span class= "ital">Upon us</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> reaching to us, and illumining and transfiguring us.

The expression is <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, and the idea is of Christ appearing in glory, and shedding his glory on us, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">For the earnest expectation of the creature</span> (or, <span class="accented">creation</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God</span>. "Revelatur gloria: et tum revelantur etiam filii Dei" (Bengel). God's sons will be revealed as being such, and glorified (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f28;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in this verse and afterwards, has been variously understood. The word properly means <span class="accented">actus creationis</span>, and is so used in ch. 1:20; but usually in the New Testament denotes what has been created, as, in English, <span class="accented">creation.</span> Sometimes, where the context limits its application, it denotes <span class="accented">mankind</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; or it may be used for an individual creature (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-39.htm">Romans 8:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Where there is nothing to limit its meaning, it must be understood of the whole visible creation, at any rate in the world of man. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-19.htm">Mark 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>. And so here, except so far as the context limits it; for see especially <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 22. It is, indeed, apparently so limited to the part of creation of which we have cognizance at present; for see <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 22, which denotes a known fact. But is there any further limitation, as many commentators contend? Putting aside as untenable, in view of the whole context (see especially ver. 23), the view of those who understand the new spiritual creation of the regenerate to be meant, we may remark as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> includes certainly all <span class="accented">mankind</span>, not excepting the regenerate. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> in ver. 23 means that "we who have the firstfruits of the Spirit" are included, not that we are a class apart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">whole</span> <span class="accented">animal creation</span> is included too. So general a term as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> could not surely have been used if man only had been meant. And it is obviously true that the whole sentient creation, as well as man, has a share now in the general suffering. To the objection that the irrational creatures cannot be conceived as sharing in the "hope" and "earnest expectation" spoken of, it may be replied that, so far as it seems to be implied that they do, it may only be that the apostle, by a fine <span class="accented">prosopopeia</span>, conceives them as feeling even as the human mind feels concerning them. But, further, conscious hope and expectation does not seem, if the language of the passage be examined, to be distinctly attributed to them. All that is of necessity implied is that they share in the groaning from which we crave deliverance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Inanimate nature too <span class="accented">may be</span> included in the idea, it also seeming to share in the present mystery of evil, and falling short of our ideal of a terrestrial paradise. Tholuck appositely quotes Philo as saying that all nature <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. It may be that St. Paul had in his mind what is said in Genesis of the cursing of the ground for man's sake, and of the thorns and thistles; and also the pictures found in the prophets of a renovated earth, in which the desert should rejoice and blossom as the rose. Calvin comments on the whole passage thus: "Omissa expesitionum varietate, hunc locum accipio, nullum esse elementum, nullamque mundi pattern, quae non, veluti praesontis miseriae agnitione tacta, in spem resurrectionis intenta sit." Again, "Spem creaturis quae sensu carent ideo tribuit, ut fideles oculos aperiant ad conspectum invisibilis vitae, quamvis adhuc sub deformi habitu lateat." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:18-25 The sufferings of the saints strike no deeper than the things of time, last no longer than the present time, are light afflictions, and but for a moment. How vastly different are the sentence of the word and the sentiment of the world, concerning the sufferings of this present time! Indeed the whole creation seems to wait with earnest expectation for the period when the children of God shall be manifested in the glory prepared for them. There is an impurity, deformity, and infirmity, which has come upon the creature by the fall of man. There is an enmity of one creature to another. And they are used, or abused rather, by men as instruments of sin. Yet this deplorable state of the creation is in hope. God will deliver it from thus being held in bondage to man's depravity. The miseries of the human race, through their own and each other's wickedness, declare that the world is not always to continue as it is. Our having received the first-fruits of the Spirit, quickens our desires, encourages our hopes, and raises our expectations. Sin has been, and is, the guilty cause of all the suffering that exists in the creation of God. It has brought on the woes of earth; it has kindled the flames of hell. As to man, not a tear has been shed, not a groan has been uttered, not a pang has been felt, in body or mind, that has not come from sin. This is not all; sin is to be looked at as it affects the glory of God. Of this how fearfully regardless are the bulk of mankind! Believers have been brought into a state of safety; but their comfort consists rather in hope than in enjoyment. From this hope they cannot be turned by the vain expectation of finding satisfaction in the things of time and sense. We need patience, our way is rough and long; but He that shall come, will come, though he seems to tarry.</body></html>
