The fortress was important to Sennacherib, as it commanded this route. In fact, Sennacherib's chief aim was Egypt, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm" title="I have dig and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.">2Kings 19:24</a>, and Herodotus (ii. 141), and it was necessary for him to secure his rear by first making himself master of the fortresses of Judah, which was in league with Egypt. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-9.htm" title="After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,">2Chronicles 32:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I have offended.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I have sinned.</span> The term "sin" is constantly used of "revolts" in the Assyrian inscriptions.<p><span class= "bld">That which thou puttest on me.</span>--In the way of tribute.

The sum mentioned is about a seventh less than that exacted by Pul from Menahem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah King of Judah sent to the King of Assyria to Lachish, saying.</span> (On the position of Lachish, see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>.) A bas-relief in the British Museum is thought to represent Sennacherib at the siege of Lachish. He is seated on a highly ornamented throne, and is engaged in receiving prisoners. The city is represented as strongly fortified, and as attacked with sealing-ladders and battering-rams. The surrender is taking place, and the captives of importance are being conducted from one of the tower-gates to the presence of the conqueror. An accompanying inscription is to the following effect: "Sennacherib, the great king, the King of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lakhisha (Lachish). I give permission for its destruction." It would seem that while Sennacherib was personally engaged in this siege, a portion of his army had invested Jerusalem, and were pressing the siege (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have offended; return from me.</span> The tone of the submission is abject. In vain had Isaiah counseled resistance, and promised deliverance if trust were placed in God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24, 25</a>). When the siege commenced, all was dismay within the walls - it was "a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>). Some of the rulers fled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>); others gave themselves up for lost, and resolved on "a short life and a merry one" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). Hezekiah found no encouragement to resist in any of his counselors except Isaiah, and was therefore driven to despair - acknowledged himself in the wrong for rebelling, and besought Sennacherib to "return from him" - <span class="accented">i.e. in</span> retire and withdraw his troops. <span class="cmt_word">That which thou puttest on me will I bear.</span> Whatever burden Sennacherib chooses to put upon him, Hezekiah says he will bear, be it tribute, be it cession of territory, be it indignity of any sort or kind. He makes no reservation; but of course he assumes that the terms about to be offered him will be such as, according in the usages of war at the time, would be regarded as reasonable. <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah King of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</span> Sennacherib says that the payment made him by Hezekiah was thirty talents of gold and <span class="accented">eight</span> hundred talents of silver ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 39, line 34). He has, perhaps, exaggerated, or he may have counted in all the silver that he carried off from the whole of Judaea; or, possibly, the payment to purchase peace was eight hundred talents, the fixed tribute three hundred. We learn from Sennacherib's inscription that, besides making this money payment, Hezekiah had to consent to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a cession of territory towards the south-west, which was apportioned between Gaza, Ekron, and Ash-deal; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the surrender of an Assyrian vassal king, detained in Jerusalem; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the contribution to the harem at Nineveh of two if not more of his daughters. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:9-16 The descent Sennacherib made upon Judah, was a great calamity to that kingdom, by which God would try the faith of Hezekiah, and chastise the people. The secret dislike, the hypocrisy, and lukewarmness of numbers, require correction; such trials purify the faith and hope of the upright, and bring them to simple dependence on God.</body></html>
