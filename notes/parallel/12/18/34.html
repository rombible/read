The reference to "my fathers" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?">2Kings 19:12</a>, and the use of the general term, "the king of Assyria" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-33.htm" title="Has any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?">2Kings 18:33</a>), are against Schrader's supposition that the historian has confused the campaigns of Sargon with those of Sennacherib. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-30.htm" title="And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,">2Kings 17:30</a>.) Sargon has recorded that <span class= "ital">Ya-u-bi-h-di,</span> king of the Hamathites, induced Arpad, Simyra, Damascus, and Samaria to join his revolt against Assyria. The confederacy was defeated at Qarqar, and Yahubihdi taken and flayed alive (B.C. 720).<p><span class= "bld">Arpad.</span>--<span class= "ital">Tell-Erfad,</span> about ten miles north of Aleppo. The question, "Where are the gods?" &c, may imply that they had been annihilated along with their temples and statues. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-10.htm" title="But man dies, and wastes away: yes, man gives up the ghost, and where is he?">Job 14:10</a>.) Sometimes, indeed, the Assyrians carried off the idols of conquered nations, but this need not have been an invariable practice, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-11.htm" title="Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?">Isaiah 10:11</a> seems to imply that they were sometimes destroyed, as was likely to be the case when a city was taken by storm, and committed to the flames.<p><span class= "bld">Sepharvaim.</span>--See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24</a>. This city revolted with Babylon against Sargon at the beginning of his reign. No account of its fall has been preserved.<p><span class= "bld">Hena, and Ivah.</span>--These names do not occur in Isaiah, and are wholly unknown. The words look like two Hebrew verbs ("He hath caused to wander, and overturned"), as at present vocalised; and the Targum translates them as a question: "Have they not made them wander, and carried them away?" Hoffmann thinks the two words are really one (the <span class= "ital">niphal</span> participle of <span class= "ital">'av'av</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and should be rendered as an epithet of Sepharvaim, "the utterly perverted;" a nickname given it by the Assyrians, because of its follyin revolting again after its former subjugation. But the mention of Ava and the Avites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-31.htm" title="And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.">2Kings 17:31</a>) is in favour of the same proper name here, and the LXX., Syriac, Arabic, and Vulg. agree with this. (The Syriac reads <span class= "ital">Avva,</span> as in chap. 7:24.)<p><span class= "bld">Have they delivered Samaria</span> <span class= "bld">. . .?</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">How much less have they </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> its gods) <span class= "ital">delivered Samaria out of mine hand!</span> So Ewald, <span class= "ital">Gram.,</span> ? 256. The Syriac, Vulg., and Arabic render as the Authorised Version. Perhaps the original reading was not <span class= "ital">k?;</span> but <span class= "ital">haki:</span> "<span class= "ital">Is it the case that</span> they have delivered?" &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-22.htm" title="Did I say, Bring to me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?">Job 6:22</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Out of mine hand?</span>--Sennacherib speaks as if he were one with his father, a circumstance which lends some support to the suggestion of Schrader, that the successive Assyrian invasions were not kept quite distinct in the Hebrew tradition. If so, the year 714 B.C. , assigned as the date of the present expedition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2Kings 18:13</a>), may really be that of an earlier expedition under Sargon, who, in fact, invaded the West in 720, 715, and 711 (or 709) B.C.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad?</span> Hamath and Arpad had been recently conquered (about <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>) by Sargon (see the 'Epouym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Of the latter city but little is known, net even its site. We find it generally connected with Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>; ' Eponym Canon,' pp. 68, 126) and Hamath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-13.htm">Isaiah 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>; ' Eponym Canon,' p. 126), and may conjecture that it lay between them, either in Coele-Syria or in the Anti-Libanus. (On Hamath, see the commentary upon 2 Kings 14:25; and for its special god, Ashima, see that on 2 Kings 17:30.) <span class="cmt_word">Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hens, and Ivah?</span> (On the cities and gods of Sepharvaim and Ivah (or Ava), see the comment on 2 Kings 17:24 and <COMMENTARY/VERSE_ONLY:2 Kings 17:31.) "Hena," mentioned always with Sepharvaim and Ivah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>), is probably Allah on the Euphrates, about seventy miles above Hit (Ivah). Nothing is known of its gods. Probably Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah had rebelled in conjunction, and been re-conquered at no distant date. Sargon mentions in his annals that he besieged and took Sepharvaim (Sippara) in his twelfth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</span> There is probably some compression of the original narrative here. The meaning is, "Have they delivered their several cities, or has the god of Samaria delivered his city out of my hand?" No god had hitherto delivered any city which the Assyrians had attacked. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:17-37 Rabshakeh tries to convince the Jews, that it was to no purpose for them to stand it out. What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.</body></html>
