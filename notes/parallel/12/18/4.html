Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.">2Chronicles 31:1</a>, and all the versions here. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm" title="And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.">2Kings 17:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made.</span>--The attempt of Bahr and others to evade the obvious force of this simple statement is quite futile. It is clear that the compiler of Kings believed that the brasen serpent which Hezekiah destroyed was a relic of the Mosaic times. (See the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4-9</a>, and the allusion to the fiery serpents in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm" title="Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>.) His authority may have been oral tradition or a written document. In ancient Egypt the serpent symbolised the healing power of Deity; a symbolism which is repeated in the Graeco-Roman myth of 'sculapius. When Moses set up the Brasen Serpent, he taught the people by means suited to their then capacity that the power of healing lay in the God whose prophet he was--namely, Jehovah; and that they must look to Him, rather than to any of the gods of Egypt, for help and healing. (Kuenen does not believe in the great antiquity of this relic. Yet the Egyptian and Babylonian remains which have come down to our time have lasted many centuries more than the interval between Moses and Hezekiah; and some of them were already ancient in the Mosaic age. Our own Doomsday Book is at least as old as the brasen serpent was when it was destroyed. There is really no tangible <span class= "ital">historical</span> ground for this extreme unwillingness to admit the authenticity of anything attributed by tradition to the authorship and handiwork of Moses.)<p><span class= "bld">And he called it.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and it was called.</span> Literally, <span class= "ital">and one called it.</span> The impersonal construction, like the German <span class= "ital">man nannte.</span><p><span class= "bld">Nehushtan.</span>--The popular name of the serpent-idol. It is vocalised as a derivative from <span class= "ital">n?'h?sheth, </span>"brass," or "copper;" but it may really be formed from <span class= "ital">n?'h?sh,</span> "serpent," and denote "great serpent" rather than "brass-god." (Comp. the term Leviathan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm" title="Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.">Job 3:8</a>.) Further, although the word is certainly not a compound of <span class= "ital">n?'h</span>?<span class= "ital">sheth, </span>"copper," and <span class= "ital">t?n </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., tannin</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> "serpent," this may have been the popular etymology of the word. (Comp. the proper name, Nehushta, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm" title="Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.

He began, as we learn from Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3, 17</a>), "in the first year of his reign, the first month, and the first day," by reopening the temple, which Ahaz had shut up, removing from it all the "filthiness" which Ahaz had allowed to accumulate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-5.htm">2 Chronicles 29:5</a>), gathering together the priests and Levites and exhorting them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4-11</a>), restoring and renewing the vessels which Ahaz had cut in pieces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-19.htm">2 Chronicles 29:19</a>), and then re-establishing the temple-worship with all due solemnity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20-35</a>). He next resolved on holding a grand Passover-festival, in the second month, as it had not been possible to keep it in the first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2, 3</a>), and invited thereto, not only his own subjects, but the Israelites of the neighboring kingdom who were not yet carried off, but were still under the rule of Hoshea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-10.htm">2 Chronicles 30:10, 11, 18</a>). It was not until this festival was over that the removal of the high places was taken in hand. Then, in a fit of zeal, which no doubt the king encouraged, a multitude of those who had kept the feast went forth from Jerusalem, first into the cities of Judah and Benjamin, and then into several of the cities of Israel, and "brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars... and utterly destroyed them all" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And brake the images, and cut down the groves</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the grove</span>, according to the present text; but, as all the versions have the plural, Thenius thinks <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> should be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Keil and Bahr, on the contrary, would retain the singular, but understand it "collectively." That idolatry was practiced at some of the high places seems clear from this place, as well as from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>). Difficulties are raised with respect to this statement. Some argue that the serpent, having served its purpose, would have been left hanging at the place where it was set up in the wilderness; others, that Moses would have destroyed it, lest the Israelites should make it an idol; others, again, that it was not likely to have lasted seven hundred years from the Exodus, even if it was brought into Palestine and taken care cf. It is supposed, therefore, that an imitation of the original serpent had been made by the Jews in the reign of Ahaz, had been called "the serpent Of Moses," and was now destroyed. But there is no sufficient reason for any of these suppositions. Considering what the serpent typified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>), it is not surprising that Moses should have been instructed to preserve it with the furniture of the tabernacle, or that, when once attached to that structure, it should have been preserved as a religious relic for seven hundred years. Many Egyptian figures in bronze now exist which are from three thousand to four thousand years old. The statement of the writer of Kings, that Hezekiah did now destroy "the serpent <span class="accented">that Moses had made</span>," is of more weight than a thousand speculations concerning what is likely, or not likely, to have happened. <span class="cmt_word">For unto these days the children of Israel did burn incense to it.</span> Not, certainly, "from Moses' time to Hezekiah's," but from a date left vague and undetermined to the time when Hezekiah took his religious reformation in hand. Hezekiah found the practice continuing; the writer is not concerned to say - perhaps does net know - when it began. He implies, however, that it was of long standing. Serpent-worship was widely spread in the East, and there was more excuse for directing religious regard toward this serpent than toward any other. <span class="cmt_word">And he called it Nehushtan</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it was called Nehushtan</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span> is a singular with indefinite subject ("one called"), equivalent to "they called," or "it was called" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29, 30</a>). Nehushtan is not from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> "serpent," but from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5ea;</span>, "brass," and means "the little brass thing," <span class="hebrew">&#x5df;</span> being a diminutive, expression of tenderness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 Hezekiah was a true son of David. Some others did that which was right, but not like David. Let us not suppose that when times and men are bad, they must needs grow worse and worse; that does not follow: after many bad kings, God raised one up like David himself. The brazen serpent had been carefully preserved, as a memorial of God's goodness to their fathers in the wilderness; but it was idle and wicked to burn incense to it. All helps to devotion, not warranted by the word of God, interrupt the exercise of faith; they always lead to superstition and other dangerous evils. Human nature perverts every thing of this kind. True faith needs not such aids; the word of God, daily thought upon and prayed over, is all the outward help we need.</body></html>
