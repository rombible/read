But the LXX., Syriac, Arabic, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-7.htm" title="But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar?">Isaiah 36:7</a> have the singular, "But if thou say," which is probably original. (Hezekiah is presently mentioned in the third person, to avoid ambiguity.)<p><span class= "bld">In the Lord our God.</span>--The emphatic words of the clause.<p><span class= "bld">Whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away.</span>--This is just the construction which a heathen would naturally put on Hezekiah's abolition of the local sanctuaries. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm" title="He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.">2Kings 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm" title="Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.">2Chronicles 31:1</a>.) The Assyrians would appear to have heard of Hezekiah's reformation, As he was a vassal of the great king, no doubt his proceedings were watched with jealous interest.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall worship . . . in Jerusalem?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Before this altar shall ye worship, at Jerusalem.</span> The great altar of burnt offering was to be the <span class= "ital">one</span> altar, and Jerusalem the <span class= "ital">one</span> city, where Jehovah might be worshipped.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if ye say unto me, We trust in the Lord our God.</span> Sennacherib had also heard of this second ground of trust, which Hezekiah had certainly put forward with great openness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-8.htm">2 Chronicles 32:8</a>). No doubt he thought it purely fantastical and illusory. But he was not unaware that it might inspire a determined resistance. He therefore condescended to argue against reliance on it. <span class="cmt_word">Is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away?</span> His counselors have suggested to Sennacherib a specious argument - How can Hezekiah confidently rely on the protection of the God of the land, Jehovah, when he has been employing himself for years in the destruction of this very God's high places and altars? Surely the God will not favor one who has been pulling down his places of worship! Putting out of sight the special requirements of the Jewish Law, the argument might well seem unanswerable. At any rate, it was calculated to have a certain effect on the minds of those who were attached to the high-place worship, and desired its continuance. <span class="cmt_word">And hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem.</span> A weak argument, if addressed to Jews of Jerusalem only, but likely to have weight with the country Jews, if, as is probable, they had crowded into the city when the invasion began. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:17-37 Rabshakeh tries to convince the Jews, that it was to no purpose for them to stand it out. What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.</body></html>
