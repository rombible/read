We may also see a contrast between the utter overthrow of the stronger kingdom and the deliverance of its smaller and weaker neighbour, because Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-5.htm" title="He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.">2Kings 18:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - THE PUNISHMENT OF SAMARIA FOR DISOBEDIENCE. In contrast with Hezekiah's piety and consequent prosperity, the author places the disobedience (ver. 12) and consequent extinction of the sister kingdom (vers. 9-11), which Belonged to Hezekiah's earlier years, and was an event of the greatest importance to him, since it made his dominions conterminous with those of Assyria, and exposed his northern frontier to attack at any moment from the Assyrian forces. According to all probable human calculation, the fall of Samaria should have been followed <span class="accented">at once</span> by an attack on Judaea; and but for the change of dynasty, and troubles on all sides which ensued thereupon, this would naturally have taken place. As it was, Judaea was allowed a Breathing-space, during which she strengthened her power in Philistia (see the comment on the preceding verse), and otherwise prepared herself to resist attack (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8-11</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah King of Israel.</span> Hezekiah Began to reign before Hoshea had completed his third year (ver. 1).

The secret dislike, the hypocrisy, and lukewarmness of numbers, require correction; such trials purify the faith and hope of the upright, and bring them to simple dependence on God.</body></html>
