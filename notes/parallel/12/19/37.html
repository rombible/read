The Hebrew version of Tobit (1:21) gives Dagon as the god. Dagon (<span class= "ital">Da-kan, Da-gan-nu</span>) was worshipped at an early date in Babylonia, and later in Assyria; but no stress can be laid on the evidence of a late version of an Apochryphon. Wellhausen thinks the original reading of the LXX. must have been <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>, which seems to involve the name of Asshur, the supreme god of the Assyrians.<p><span class= "bld">Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him.</span>--The Assyrian monuments are silent on the subject of the death of Sennacherib. For Adrammelech, see the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-31.htm" title="And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.">2Kings 17:31</a>. Sharezer, in Assyrian, <span class= "ital">Sar-u</span>c<span class= "ital">ur,</span> "protect the king," is only part of a name. The other half is found in Abydenus (<span class= "ital">apud</span> Eusebius), who records that Sennacherib was slain by his son Adramelos, and succeeded by Nergilos (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Nergal), who was slain by Axerdis (Esarhaddon). From this it appears that the full name was <span class= "ital">Nergal-sar-u</span>c<span class= "ital">ur,</span> "Nergal protect the king!" (the Greek Neriglissar.) (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm" title="So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;">Jeremiah 39:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And they escaped into the land of Armenia.</span>--Ararat, the Assyrian <span class= "ital">Urartu,</span> was the name of the great plain through which the Araxes flowed. The battle in which Esarhaddon defeated his brothers was fought somewhere in Little Armenia, near the Euphrates, according to Schrader, who gives a fragment of an inscription apparently relating thereto.<p><span class= "bld">Esarhaddon.</span>--The Assyrian <span class= "ital">Assur-aha-iddina, "</span>Asshur gave a brother," who reigned 681-668 B.C.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> - seventeen or eighteen years afterwards; not "fifty-five days" after, as the author of Tobit (1. 21) says - <span class="cmt_word">as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god.</span> The word Nisroch offers considerable difficulty. It has been connected with <span class="accented">nesher</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>), "eagle," and explained as a reference to the eagle-headed genius sometimes seen in the Assyrian sculptures ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 265). But there is no evidence that the genii were ever worshipped in Assyria, much less that they had temples of their own, nor is any name resembling "Nisroch" attached to any of them. The word itself is somewhat doubtful, and different manuscripts of the Septuagint, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>, have the variants of <span class="accented">Nasaraeh</span>, <span class="accented">Esorach</span>, <span class="accented">Meserach</span>, and <span class="accented">Asarach</span>, while Josephus has <span class="accented">Araskas</span>. Asarach might conceivably be a strengthened form of Asshur; but the substitution of <span class="accented">samech</span> for <span class="accented">shin</span> is against this explanation. Still, Asshur was certainly Sennacherib's favorite god, the deity whom he principally worshipped. Josephus regards the name as belonging, not to the god, but to the temple (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), which is perhaps the true solution of the difficulty. Translate - "as he was worshipping his god in the house Nisroch." <span class="cmt_word">That Adram-melech and Sharezer his sons.</span> Adram-melech is called "Adrammeles" by Aby-denus, "Ardamazanes" by Polyhistor. Neither form resembles any known Assyrian name, but <span class="accented">Adrammelech has a good</span> Semitic derivation (see the comment on 2 Kings 18:31). "Sharezer" is probably a shortened form of Nergal-shar-ozer (comp. "Shalman," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), which was a name in use at the time ('Eponym Canon,' p. 68). Abydenus seems to have called him Nergilus. <span class="cmt_word">Smote him with the sword.</span> So Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:1. &sect; 5) and Mos. Chor. ('Hist. Armen.,' 1:22). A mutilated inscription of Esarhaddon's seems to have described his war with his brothers ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 103) at the commencement of his reign, but the earlier part is wanting. <span class="cmt_word">And they escaped into the land of Armenia</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of Ararat</span>. The Hebrew "Ararat" is the Assyrian "Ur-arda" - the ordinary name for the country about Lakes Van and Urumiyeh. The name "Armenia" is not found earlier than the inscriptions of Darius Hystaspis. <span class="cmt_word">And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</span> Esarhaddon (the <span class="accented">Sarchedon</span> of Tobit 1:21, and the Asshur-akh-iddin of the Assyrian inscriptions) succeeded his father in <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>, and was engaged for some time in a war with his brothers on the Upper Euphrates, after which he made himself master of Nineveh. He reigned from <span class="date">B.C. 681</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 669</span>, when he was succeeded by his son, Asshur-bani-pal. Assyria reached the acme of her prosperity in his time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:35-37 That night which followed the sending of this message to Hezekiah, the main body of their army was slain. See how weak the mightiest men are before Almighty God. Who ever hardened himself against Him and prospered? The king of Assyria's own sons became his murderers. Those whose children are undutiful, ought to consider whether they have not been so to their Father in heaven? This history exhibits a strong proof of the good of firm trust and confidence in God. He will afflict, but not forsake his people. It is well when our troubles drive us to our knees. But does it not reprove our unbelief? How unwilling are we to rest on the declaration of Jehovah! How desirous to know in what way he will save us! How impatient when relief is delayed! But we must wait for the fulfilling of his word. Lord, help our unbelief.</body></html>
