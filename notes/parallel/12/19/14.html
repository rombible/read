Hezekiall's act was a solemn and perfectly natural indication to his ministers and people that he had put the matter into the hands of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah received the letter.</span> It had not been previously stated that Sennacherib had written a letter. But the author forgets this, and so speaks of "the letter." Kings generally communicated by letters, and not merely by messages (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-9.htm">Nehemiah 1:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Of the hand of the messengers, and read it.</span> Probably Sennacherib had caused it to be written in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord.</span> Not as if God would not otherwise know the contents of the letter, but to emphasize his detestation of the letter, and to make it silently plead for him with God. Ewald rightly compares what Judas Maccabaeus did with the disfigured copies of the Law at Maspha (1 Macc. 3:48), but incorrectly calls it ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 183, note 1, Eng. trans.) "a laying down of the object <span class="accented">in the sanctuary</span>." Maspha was "over against" the temple, at the distance of a mile or more. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:8-19 Prayer is the never-failing resource of the tempted Christian, whether struggling with outward difficulties or inward foes. At the mercy-seat of his almighty Friend he opens his heart, spreads his case, like Hezekiah, and makes his appeal. When he can discern that the glory of God is engaged on his side, faith gains the victory, and he rejoices that he shall never be moved. The best pleas in prayer are taken from God's honour.</body></html>
