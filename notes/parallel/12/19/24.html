Sennacherib means that this is what he is wont to do. As mountains do not stop him (ver. 23), so deserts do not stop him - he digs wells in them, and drinks water "strange" to the soil - never before seen there. <span class="cmt_word">And with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places</span>; rather, <span class="accented">will</span> 1 <span class="accented">dry up all the rivers of Egypt</span> (compare the Revised Version. "Mazor" is used for "Egypt" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>). It is the old singular from which was formed the dual Mizraim. Whether it meant "land of strength" (Pusey), or "land of distress" (Ewald), may be doubted, since we have no right to assume a Hebrew derivation. There was probably a native word, from which the Hebrew <span class="accented">Mazor</span>, the Assyrian <span class="accented">Muzr</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">Misr</span> were taken. Sennacherib's beast is that, as he makes deserts traversable by digging wells, so, if rivers try to stop him, he will find a way of drying them up. Compare the boasts of Alaric in Claudian ('Bell. Get.,' pp. 525-532), who had probably this passage of Kings in his thoughts - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"To patior suadente fugam, cum cesserit omnis<br />Obsequiis natura meis?<br />Subsidere nostris Sub pedibus montes, arescere vidimus amnes<br />Fregi Alpes, galeisque Padum victricibus hausi."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:20-34 All Sennacherib's motions were under the Divine cognizance. God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as good ground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit in our lives.</body></html>
