not, however, as if Jehovah's eyes were closed before this prayer. To treat the figurative language of the Old Testament in such a manner does violence to common sense. "Bow thine ear," "Open thine eyes," in Hezekiah's mouth simply meant "Intervene actively between me and my enemy;" although, no doubt, such expressions originally conveyed the actual thoughts of the Israelites about God.<p><span class= "bld">Which hath sent him.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">which he hath sent.</span> The "words" are regarded as a single whole, a <span class= "ital">message.</span><p><span class= "bld">The living God.</span>--In contrast with the lifeless idols of Hamath, Arpad, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Lord, bow down thine ear, and hear.</span> "Bow down thine ear" is a Hebrew idiom for "give ear," "attend "(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-2.htm">Psalm 71:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-1.htm">Psalm 86:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, etc.). It is based upon the fact that, when men wish to catch exactly what another says to them, they bend themselves towards him, and bring one ear as near to him as they can. <span class="cmt_word">Open, Lord, thine eyes, and see.</span> Take cognizance both with eye and ear; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> take <span class="accented">full</span> cognizance - let nothing escape thee. <span class="cmt_word">And hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which he has sent to reproach</span>. The suffix translated "him" in our version really means "it" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the speech or letter of Sennacherib, which Hezekiah has "spread before the Lord." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:8-19 Prayer is the never-failing resource of the tempted Christian, whether struggling with outward difficulties or inward foes. At the mercy-seat of his almighty Friend he opens his heart, spreads his case, like Hezekiah, and makes his appeal. When he can discern that the glory of God is engaged on his side, faith gains the victory, and he rejoices that he shall never be moved. The best pleas in prayer are taken from God's honour.</body></html>
