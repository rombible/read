Instead of the word <span class= "ital">blasting</span> the parallel text (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-27.htm" title="Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.">Isaiah 37:27</a>) has <span class= "ital">field</span>--a difference of one letter. Thenius adopts this, and corrects <span class= "ital">stalk</span> into <span class= "ital">east wind,</span> no great change in the Hebrew. We thus get the appropriate expression: <span class= "ital">and a field before the east wind.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power</span>; literally, <span class="accented">were short of hand</span> - unable, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> make an effectual resistance. When God has decreed a change in the distribution of power among the nations, his providence works doubly. It infuses confidence and strength into the aggressive people, and spreads dismay and terror among those who are attacked. Unaccountable panics seize them - they seem paralyzed; instead of making every possible preparation for resistance, they fold their hands and do nothing. They are like fascinated birds before the stealthy advance of the serpent. <span class="cmt_word">They were dismayed and confounded.</span> Historically, the prophet declares, this was the cause of the general collapse of the nations whom the Assyrians attacked. God put a craven fear into their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house-tops.</span> The "grass of the field" is one of the most frequent similes for weakness. "All flesh is grass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>); "They shall soon be cut down like the grass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>); "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>); "I am withered like grass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>). In the hot sun of an Eastern sky nothing faded more quickly. But this weakness was intensified in the "grass of the house-tops." It "withered before it grew up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>). The depth of earth was so slight, the exposure so great, the heat so scorching, that it sank in death almost as soon as it had sprung to life. Such has been the weakness of the nations given over as a prey to the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_word">And as corn blasted before it be grown up.</span> Corn blasted before it shoots into a stalk is as frail as grass, or frailer. It dwindles and disappears without even asserting itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:20-34 All Sennacherib's motions were under the Divine cognizance. God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as good ground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit in our lives.</body></html>
