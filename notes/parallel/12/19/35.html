SENNACHERIB'S RETREAT, AND HIS "VIOLENT END.</span><p>(35) <span class= "bld">And it came to pass </span>(in)<span class= "bld"> that night.</span>--This definition of time is wanting in the parallel text; but it is implied by the phrase in the morning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">Isaiah 37:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">2Kings 19:35</a>). The night intended can hardly be the one which followed the day when the prophecy was spoken (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.">2Kings 19:29</a>). The expression "in that night," may perhaps be compared with the prophetic "in that day," and understood to. mean simply "in that memorable night which was the occasion of this catastrophe." (Theuius sees in this clause an indication that the present section was derived from another source, probably from the one used by the chronicler in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/32-20.htm" title="And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.">2Chronicles 32:20-23</a>. Reuss thinks this confirmed by the fact that neither the prediction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-7.htm" title="Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.">2Kings 19:7</a>, nor that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/19-21.htm" title="This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.">2Kings 19:21-34</a>, speaks of so great and so immediate an overthrow.)<p><span class= "bld">The angel of the Lord went out.</span>--The destroying angel, who smote the firstborn of the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/12-12.htm" title="For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.">Exodus 12:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>), and smote Israel after David's census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/24-15.htm" title="So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.">2Samuel 24:15-17</a>). These passages undoubtedly favour the view that the Assyrian army was devastated by pestilence, as Josephus asserts. Others have suggested the agency of a simoom, a storm with lightning, an earthquake, &c. In any case a supernatural causation is involved not only in the immense number slain, and that in one night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-6.htm" title="Nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness; nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.">Psalm 91:6</a>), but in the coincidence of the event with the predictions of Isaiah, and with the crisis in the history of the true religion:<p>"Vuolsi cosi cola dove si puote<p>Ci� che si vuole; e pi� non dimandare."<p><span class= "bld">In the camp of the Assyrians.</span>--Where this was is not said. That it was not before Jerusalem appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/19-32.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.">2Kings 19:32-33</a>; and the well-known narrative of Herodotus (ii. 141) fixes Egypt, the land of plagues, as the scene of the catastrophe. "Of the details of the catastrophe, which the Bible narrative is content to characterise as the act of God, the Assyrian monuments contain no record, because the issue of the campaign gave them nothing to boast of; but an Egyptian account, preserved by Herodotus, though full of fabulous circumstances, shows that in Egypt, as well as in Judaea, it was recognised as a direct intervention of Divine power. The disaster did not break the power of the great king, who continued to reign for twenty years, and waged many other victorious wars. But none the less it must have been a very grave blow, the effects of which were felt throughout the empire, and permanently modified the imperial policy; for in the following year Chaldaea was again in revolt, and to the end of his reign Sennacherib never renewed his attack upon Judah" (<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">And when they arose early.</span>--The few who were spared found, not sick and dying, but corpses, all around them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-33.htm" title="And the Egyptians were urgent on the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.">Exodus 12:33</a> : "They said, we be all dead men.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-37.</span> - DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB'S HOST, AND HIS OWN VIOLENT DEATH AT NINEVEH. The sequel is told in a few words. That night destruction came down on the host of Sennacherib, as it lay en-camped at some distance from Jerusalem, silently and swiftly. Without noise, without disturbance, the sleeping men slept the sleep of death, and in the morning, when the survivors awoke, it was found that a hundred and eighty-five thousand were slain. Upon this, with the remnant of his army, Sennacherib hastily returned to Nineveh. There, some time after - about seventeen years according to our reckoning - a conspiracy was formed against him by two of his sons, who murdered him as he was worshipping in a temple, and fled into Armenia. Another son, Esarhaddon, succeeded. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass that night.</span> The important expression, "that night," is omitted from the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>, but is undoubtedly an original portion of the present history. It can have no other meaning - as Keil and Bahr have seen - than "the night following the day on which Isaiah had foretold to Hezekiah the deliverance of Jerusalem." God's word "runneth very swiftly." No sooner was the premise given than the destroying angel received his orders, and "that night" the terrible stroke fell. <span class="cmt_word">That the angel of the Lord went out</span>; or, <span class="accented">an angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, LXX.). We cannot say, with Bahr, that it was "the same one who smote the firstborn in Egypt, and inflicted the pestilence after the census under David." Revelation does not tell us that there is definitely one destroying angel. "The angel of death" is a rabbinical invention. It accords rather with the analogy of God's dealings that he should use at one time the services of one minister, at another time those of another. <span class="cmt_word">And smote.</span> Imagination has been over-busy in conjecturing the exact manner of the smiting. Some critics have suggested pestilence, or more definitely "the plague" (Gesenius, Dathe, Maurer, Ewald, Winer, Thenins, Keil, etc.); others a terrible storm (Vitringa, Stanley); others the simoom (Prideaux, Milman); others a nocturnal attack by Tirhakah (Ussher, Preiss, Michaelis). Some of these the text altogether precludes, as the attack of Tirhakah, which must have aroused the whole host, and not left the disaster to be discovered by those who "awoke early in the morning." Others are improbable, as the simoom, or a terrible storm with thunder and lightning, which have never been known to accomplish such a destruction. Pestilence is no doubt possible, but a pestilence of a strange and miraculous character, to which men succumbed without awaking or disturbing others. But the narrative rather points to sudden and silent death during sleep, such as often happens to men in the course of nature singly, and here on this occasion was made to happen in one night to a hundred and eighty-five thousand men by the Divine omnipotence acting abnormally. <span class="cmt_word">In the camp of the Assyrians.</span> The destruction was not only at one time, but in one place. "The camp of the Assyrians" cannot mean half a dozen camps situated in half a dozen different places, as Keil supposes. Sennacherib was somewhere with his main army, encamped for the night, and there, wherever it was, the blow fell. But the exact locality is uncertain. All that the narrative makes clear is that it was not in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. Herodotus places the catastrophe at Pelusium (2. 141). Bahr thinks it was probably before Libnah. I should incline to place it between Libnah and the Egyptian frontier, Sennacherib, when he heard that Tirhakah was coming against him (ver. 9), having naturally marched forward to meet and engage his army. <span class="cmt_word">A hundred four score and five thousand.</span> These figures do not pretend to exactness, and can scarcely have been more than a rough estimate. They are probably the Assyrians' own estimate of their loss, which the Jews would learn from such of the fugitives as fell into their hands. <span class="cmt_word">And when they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the survivors - <span class="cmt_word">arose early in the morning, they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hundred and eighty-five thousand - <span class="cmt_word">were all dead corpses</span> - absolutely dead, that is; not merely sick or dying. The fact makes against the theory of a pestilence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:35-37 That night which followed the sending of this message to Hezekiah, the main body of their army was slain. See how weak the mightiest men are before Almighty God. Who ever hardened himself against Him and prospered? The king of Assyria's own sons became his murderers. Those whose children are undutiful, ought to consider whether they have not been so to their Father in heaven? This history exhibits a strong proof of the good of firm trust and confidence in God. He will afflict, but not forsake his people. It is well when our troubles drive us to our knees. But does it not reprove our unbelief? How unwilling are we to rest on the declaration of Jehovah! How desirous to know in what way he will save us! How impatient when relief is delayed! But we must wait for the fulfilling of his word. Lord, help our unbelief.</body></html>
