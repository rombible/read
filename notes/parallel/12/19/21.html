Zion here, as Jerusalem in the next line, is regarded as <span class= "ital">mother</span> of the people dwelling there. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm" title="I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?">2Samuel 20:19</a>.) The term Virgin naturally denotes the inviolable security of the citadel of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">Hath shaken her head at thee.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">hath nodded behind thee.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm" title="He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.">Psalm 22:8</a>.) The people of Jerusalem nod in scorn at the retiring envoys of Sennacherib.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning him.</span> "Him" is, of course, Sennacherib. It adds great liveliness and force to the opening portion of the oracle, that it should be addressed directly by Jehovah to Sennacherib, as an answer to his bold challenge. The only address at all similar in Scripture is that to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31, 32</a>), spoken by "a voice from heaven" But the present passage is one of far greater force and beauty. <span class="cmt_word">The virgin the daughter of Zion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the virgin daughter of Zion</span>, or <span class="accented">the virgin daughter</span>, <span class="accented">Zion</span>. Cities were commonly personified by the sacred writers, and represented as "daughters" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-10.htm">Isaiah 23:10, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a>, etc.). "Virgin daughter" here may perhaps represent "the consciousness of impregnability" (Drechsler); but the phrase seems to have been used rhetorically or poetically, to heighten the beauty or pathos of the picture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>), without any reference to the question whether the particular city had or had not been previously taken. Jerusalem certainly had been taken by Shishak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>), and by Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>); but Zion, if it be taken as the name of the eastern city (Bishop Patrick, <span class="accented">ad</span> lee.), may have been still a "virgin fortress." <span class="cmt_word">Hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn</span>; or, <span class="accented">despises thee and laughs thee to scorn</span>. The Hebrew preterite has often a present sense. Whatever was the case a little while ago (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1-14</a>), the city now laughs at thy threats. <span class="cmt_word">The daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee</span>; or, <span class="accented">wags her head at thee - in</span> scorn and ridicule (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:20-34 All Sennacherib's motions were under the Divine cognizance. God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as good ground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit in our lives.</body></html>
