The "rumour" or report intended is presently specified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm" title="And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,">2Kings 19:9</a>); "for though Sennacherib made one more attempt to bring about the surrender of Jerusalem, his courage must have left him when it failed, and the thought of retreat must have suggested itself, the execution of which was only accelerated by the blow which fell upon his army" (<span class= "ital">Keil</span> and <span class= "ital">Thenius</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will send a blast upon him.</span> The meaning is doubtful. Most modern critics translate, with the LXX., "I will put a spirit within him," and understand "a spirit of cowardice," or "a despondent mood" (Thenius), or "an extraordinary impulse of Divine inspiration, which is to hurry him blindly on" (Drechsler). But the idea of our translators, that the blast (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) is external, and sent <span class="accented">upon</span> him, not put in him - that, in fact, the destruction of his army is referred to, seems defensible by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>. The prophecy was, no doubt, intentionally vague - enough for its immediate purpose, which was to comfort and strengthen Hezekiah - but not intended to gratify man's curiosity by revealing the exact mode in which God would work. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall hear a rumor</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">shall hear a hearsay</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall be told something, which shall determine him on a hasty retreat. It is best, I think, to understand, not news of Tirhakah's advance (Knobel, Keil, Bahr), much less news of an insurrection in some other part of the empire (Cheyne), but information of the disaster to his army. It is no objection to this that Sennacherib was "with his army." No doubt he was. But he would learn the catastrophe from the mouth of some one who came into his tent and told him - he would "hear a hearsay" <span class="cmt_word">And shall return to his own land</span> (see ver. 36), <span class="cmt_word">and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span> (On Sennacherib's murder, see the comment upon ver. 37.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-7 Hezekiah discovered deep concern at the dishonour done to God by Rabshakeh's blasphemy. Those who speak from God to us, we should in a particular manner desire to speak to God for us. The great Prophet is the great Intercessor. Those are likely to prevail with God, who lift up their hearts in prayer. Man's extremity is God's opportunity. While his servants can speak nothing but terror to the profane, the proud, and the hypocritical, they have comfortable words for the discouraged believer.</body></html>
