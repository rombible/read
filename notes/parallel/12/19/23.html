The royal palace and grounds appear to be meant. Thenius compares "the house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm" title="He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.">1Kings 7:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By thy messengers</span> - literally, <span class="accented">by the hand of thy messengers</span> - Rabshakeh and others (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-30.htm">2 Kings 18:30, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-10.htm">2 Kings 19:10-13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">thou hast reproached the Lord, and but said.</span> Sennacherib had net <span class="accented">said</span> what is here attributed to him, any more than Sargon had <span class="accented">said</span> the words ascribed to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13, 14</a>. But he had <span class="accented">thought</span> it; and God accounts men's deliberate thoughts as their utterances. Isaiah's "oracle" brings out and places in a striking light the pride, self-confidence, and self-sufficiency which underlay Sennacherib's messages and letters. <span class="cmt_word">With the multitude of my chariots</span>; or, <span class="accented">with chariots upon chariots</span>. The chariot-force was the main arm of the Assyrian military service - that on which most dependence was placed, and to which victory was commonly attributed. The number of chariots that could be brought into the field by the Assyrians is nowhere stated; but we find nearly four thousand hostile chariots collected to oppose an ordinary Assyrian invasion, and defeated (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 362, note 8). The estimates of Cterias - eleven thousand for Ninas, and a hundred thousand for Semiramis (Died. Sic., 2:5. &sect; 4) - are, of course, unhistorical. <span class="cmt_word">I am come up to the height of the mountains.</span> "The height of the mountains" is here the high ground which an army would have to traverse in passing from the Coele-Syrian valley into Palestine. It is not exactly Lebanon, which runs parallel with the coast, and certainly does not "guard Palestine to the north," as Keil supposes; But it may be viewed as a "side" or "flank" of Lebanon. In point of fact, Lebanon and Hermon unite their roots to form a barrier between the Coele-Syrian plain (<span class="accented">El Buka'a</span>) and the valley of the Jordan, and an invader from the north must cross this barrier. It is not so difficult or rugged but that the Assyrians could bring their chariots ever it. They were accustomed to traverse far more difficult regions in Zagros and Niphatos and Taurus, and to carry their chariots with them, dismounting when necessary, and having the vehicles lifted over obstacles by human hands (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74). <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon.</span> An army which invades Palestine by the Coele-Syrian valley - quite the easiest and most usual line of invasion - necessarily passes along the entire eastern "side," or "flank," of Lebanon, which is the proper meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and not "loftiest height" (Keil), or "innermost recess" (Revised Version). The plural, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, is natural when a mountain range, like Lebanon, is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">And will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof.</span> The felling of timber in the Syrian mountain-chains was a common practice of the Assyrian invaders, and had two quite distinct objects. Sometimes it was mere cruel devastation, done to injure and impoverish the inhabitants; but more often it was done for the sake of the timber which the conqueror carried off into his own country. "The mountains of Amanus I ascended," says Asshur-nazir-pal; "wood for bridges, pines, box, cypress, I cut down... cedar-wood from Amanus I destined for Bit-Hira and my pleasure-house called Azmaku, and for the temple of the moon and sun, the exalted gods. I proceeded to the land of Iz-mehri, and took possession of it throughout: I cut down beams for bridges, and carried them to Nineveh" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 74). The cedar (<span class="accented">erez</span>) and the pine, or juniper (<span class="accented">berosh</span>), were in special request. <span class="cmt_word">And I will enter into the lodgings of his borders -</span> rather, the <span class="accented">lodge of its</span> border - perhaps a palace or hunting-lodge on the outskirt of the Lebanon forest region (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and into the forest of his Carmel</span>; rather, the <span class="accented">forest of its orchard</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the choicest part of the Lebanon forest region - the part which is rather park or orchard than mere forest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:20-34 All Sennacherib's motions were under the Divine cognizance. God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as good ground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit in our lives.</body></html>
