Keil's remark, however, is also to the purpose: "The metaphor is taken from wild animals, which are thus held in check--the ring in the nose of lions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-4.htm" title="The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 19:4</a>), and other wild beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm" title="But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will bring you up out of the middle of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick to your scales.">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-28.htm" title="And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the middle of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.">Isaiah 30:28</a>), the bridle in the mouth of intractable horses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm" title="Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near to you.">Psalm 32:9</a>). This agrees with "I will turn thee back," &c. (With this last comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-24.htm" title="How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?">2Kings 18:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult</span> - rather, <span class="accented">thy arrogancy</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5df;</span> is rather the quiet security of extreme pride and self-confidence than "tumult" - <span class="cmt_word">is come up into mine ears</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has attracted my notice - <span class="cmt_word">therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips.</span> The imagery is most striking. Captive kings were actually so treated by the Assyrians themselves. A hook or split-ring was thrust through the cartilage of the nose, or the fleshy part of the under lip, with a rope or thong attached to it, and in this guise they were led into the monarch's presence, to receive their final sentence at his hands. In the sculptures of Sargon at Khorsabad we see three prisoners brought before him in this fashion, one of whom he seems to be about to kill with a spear ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 367). In another sculpture set up by a Babylonian king, his vizier brings before him two captives similarly treated, but with the ring, apparently, passed through the cartilage of their noses (ibid., vol. 3. p. 436) Manasseh seems to have received the same treatment at the hands of the "captains" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>) who brought him a prisoner to Esarhaddon at Babylon. Other allusions to the practice in Scripture will be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>. The threat in the present passage was, of course, not intended to be understood life-rally, but only as a declaration that God would bring down the pride of Sennacherib, humiliate him, and reduce him to a state of abject weakness and abasement. <span class="cmt_word">And I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest</span> (comp. ver. 33). The meaning is clear. Sennacherib would not be allowed to come near Jerusalem. He would hurry back by the low coast route (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>), by which he had made his invasion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:20-34 All Sennacherib's motions were under the Divine cognizance. God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as good ground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit in our lives.</body></html>
