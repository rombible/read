More than one place bore the name.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed?</span> The Assyrian kings always speak of all their predecessors as their ancestors. In point of fact, Sennacherib bad had only one "father" among the previous kings, viz. Sargon. <span class="cmt_word">As Gozan</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 17:6). It is uncertain at what time Gozan was finally conquered and absorbed. It was frequently overrun by the Assyrians from the reign of Tiglath-pileser I. (about <span class="date">B.C. 1100</span>); but it was probably not absorbed until about <span class="date">B.C. 809</span>. The Prefect of Gozan first appears in the list of Assyrian Eponyms in <span class="date">B.C. 794</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And Haran.</span> "Haran" is generally admitted to be the city of Terah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-32.htm">Genesis 11:32</a>), and indeed there is no rival claimant of the name. Its position was in the western part of the Gauzanitis region, on the Belik, about lat. 36&deg; 50' N. It was probably conquered by Assyria about the same time as Gozan. <span class="cmt_word">And Reseph.</span> A town called "Razappa," probably "Rezeph," appears in the Assyrian inscriptions from an early date. It is thought to have been in the near vicinity of Haran, but had been conquered and absorbed as early as <span class="date">B.C. 818</span>. Whether it is identical with the Resapha of Ptolemy ('Geograph.,' 5:15) is doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Eden.</span> Probably the inhabitants of a city called "Bit-Adini" in the Assyrian inscriptions, which was on the Middle Euphrates, not far from Carchemish, on the left bank ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 69, 71, etc.). This place was conquered by Asshur-nazir-pal, about <span class="date">B.C. 877</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Which were in Thelasar.</span> "Thelasar" is probably the Hebrew equivalent of "Tel-Asshur," "the hill or fort of Asshur," which may have been the Assyrian name of Bit-Adini, or of a city dependent on it. Asshur-nazir-pal gave Assyrian names to several cities on the Middle Euphrates (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 55, line 48; p. 69, line 50). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:8-19 Prayer is the never-failing resource of the tempted Christian, whether struggling with outward difficulties or inward foes. At the mercy-seat of his almighty Friend he opens his heart, spreads his case, like Hezekiah, and makes his appeal. When he can discern that the glory of God is engaged on his side, faith gains the victory, and he rejoices that he shall never be moved. The best pleas in prayer are taken from God's honour.</body></html>
