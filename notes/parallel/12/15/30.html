"The land of Beth-Croft," he says, "... the tribe... the goods of its people and their furniture I sent to Assyria. Pekah their king [I caused to be put to death?] and Hoshea I appointed to the kingdom ever them; their tribute I received, and [their treasures?] to Assyria I sent" ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123, 124, lines 15-19). It is probably this invasion of which the writer of Chronicles speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>) as resulting in the deportation of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. <span class="cmt_word">In the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.</span> This date stands in contradiction with ver. 33, where Jotham's entire reign is reckoned at sixteen years, and apparently must be a corrupt reading. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:8-31 This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not without troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel. The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. We have reason to be thankful for restraints, for being kept out of temptation, and should beg of God to renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
