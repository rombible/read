It must have become amply evident to the kings of Judah, at any rate from the time of the attack on Menahem (ver. 19), that the independence of both kingdoms was menaced by Assyria, and that it was of great importance that their principal fortresses should be placed in a state of efficient defense. Azariah had paid great attention to the fortifying and arming of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9, 15</a>), and his son now followed in his footsteps. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a> we learn that he not only built the high gate of the temple, but also "on the wall of Ophel built much," Nor was he content with fortifying the capital. He also "built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers." Tiglath-pileser had made war on his father ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 117, 118). He felt that any day his own turn might come. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:32-38 Jotham showed great respect to the temple.
