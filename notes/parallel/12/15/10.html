So all the versions except the LXX. The open assassination of the king is noted, in contrast with the secrecy with which former conspiracies had been concerted. It is a symptom of the rapidly-increasing corruption of morals, which allowed people to look on with indifference while the king was being murdered. (The LXX. puts the Hebrew words into Greek letters thus: <span class= "greekheb">???????</span><span class= "ital">.</span> The word <span class= "ital">qobol</span>--"before"--is Aramaic rather than Hebrew, and only occurs here. Ewald acutely conjectured that <span class= "ital">Qobol'?m--"</span>before people"--was really the proper name of another usurper, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-8.htm" title="Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.">Zechariah 11:8</a>, "the third king during that month;" but in that case the narrative is hardly coherent of complete. Gratz suggests the correction "in Ibleam."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him.</span> Josephus calls Shallum Zachariah's "friend," but otherwise adds nothing to the present narrative. <span class="cmt_word">And smote him before the people.</span> The phrase employed is very unusual, and has justly excited suspicion. It was not understood by the LXX., who translate <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>, which gives no sense. Ewald sought to solve the difficulty by inventing a king, "Zobolam," but other critics have found this expedient too bold. The rendering of our translators is generally accepted, though <span class="accented">qobal</span>, "before," only occurs here and in Daniel. If we accept this rendering, we must suppose that the act of violence was done openly, like Jehu's murder of Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">And slew him, and reigned in his stead</span> (comp. ver. 13). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:8-31 This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not without troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel. The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. We have reason to be thankful for restraints, for being kept out of temptation, and should beg of God to renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
