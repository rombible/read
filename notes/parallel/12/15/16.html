Pul's retirement was bought by a large sum of money, which Menahem collected from his subjects (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Menahem smote Tiphsah.</span> The only town of this name known to history or geography is the famous city on the Euphrates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>), called by the Greeks Thapsacus. It has been thought that Menahem could not have pushed his conquests so far, and a second Tiphsah has been invented in the Israelite highland, between Tirzah and Samaria, of which there is no other notice anywhere. But "Tiphsah," which means "passage" or "fordway," is an unsuitable name for a city in such a situation. The view of Keil is clearly tenable - that Zachariah had intended to carry on his father's warlike policy, and had collected an army for a great Eastern expedition, which had its head-quarters at the royal city of Tirzah, and was under the command of Menahem. As the expedition was about to start, the news came that Shallum had murdered Zachariah and usurped the throne. Menahem upon this proceeded from Tirzah to Samaria, crushed Shallum, and, returning to his army, carried out without further delay the expedition already resolved upon. The Assyrian records show that, at the probable date of the expedition, Assyria was exceptionally weak, and in no condition to resist an attack, though a little later, under Tiglath-pileser, she recovered herself<span class="cmt_word">. And all that were therein, and the coasts thereof, from Tirzah.</span> "From Tirzah" means "starting from Tir-zah," as in ver. 14. It is to be connected with "smote," not with "coasts." Because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it. Determined resistance on the part of a city summoned to surrender has always been regarded as justifying an extreme severity of treatment. It is not clear that Menahem transgressed the ordinary usages of war in what he did, however much he transgressed the laws of humanity. <span class="cmt_word">And all the women therein that were with child he ripped up</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, with the comment; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:8-31 This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not without troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel. The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. We have reason to be thankful for restraints, for being kept out of temptation, and should beg of God to renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
