The word armon, rendered "palace," is usually explained as meaning citadel or keep, from a root meaning to be high. (Comp. <span class= "greekheb">? ????</span> in Greek.) Ewald makes it the harem, which, as the innermost and most strongly-guarded part of an Oriental palace, is probably meant here. Thither Pekahiah had fled for refuge before the conspirators.<p><span class= "bld">With Argob and Arieh.</span>--Pekah slew these two persons, probably officers of the royal guard, who stood by their master, as well as the king himself.<p>The peculiar names are an indication of the <span class= "ital">historical</span> character of the account. Argob suggests that the person who bore this name was a native of the district of Bashan so designated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-13.htm" title="The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, three score great cities with walls and brazen bars:">1Kings 4:13</a>); Arieh ("lion"), like our own Cceur-de-Lion, betokens strength and bravery. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm" title="And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes on the mountains;">1Chronicles 12:8</a>, "The Gadites, whose faces were as the faces of lions.")<p><span class= "bld">And with him fifty men of the Gileadites.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">and with him were fifty,</span> &c. Pekah was supported by fifty soldiers, probably of the royal guard. Menahem himself was of Gadite origin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-17.htm" title="In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.">2Kings 15:17</a>), and so belonged to Gilead. He would therefore be likely to recruit his body-guard from among the Gileadites, who were always famous for their prowess. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm" title="There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.">Joshua 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-12.htm" title="And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?">Judges 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-31.htm" title="Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.">1Chronicles 26:31</a>.) The two names Argob and Arieh agree with this supposition. The LXX. reads, in place of "the Gileadites," <span class= "greekheb">??? ??? ???????????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> "of the four hundred," which reminds us of David's six hundred <span class= "ital">Gibborim</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm" title="And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.">2Samuel 15:18</a>).<p>Josephus accounts for the short reign of Pekahiah by the statement that he imitated the cruelty of his father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-26.</span> - SHORT REIGN OF PEKA-HIAH. The short reign of Pekahiah was wholly undistinguished. He held the throne for two years only, or perhaps for parts of two years, and performed no action that any historian has thought worthy of record. Our author has nothing to relate of him but the circumstances of his death (ver. 25), wherewith he combines the usual formulae (vers. 23, 24, 26). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:8-31 This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not without troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel. The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. We have reason to be thankful for restraints, for being kept out of temptation, and should beg of God to renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
