It was no long time since Jeroboam II. had recovered it for Israel. According to Schrader (<span class= "ital">K.A.T.,</span> pp. 254, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) the reference of the verse is to Tiglath Pileser's expedition in B.C. 734, called in the Eponym list an expedition to the land of <span class= "ital">Pilista</span> (Philistia). With this Schrader connects a fragment of the annals which begins with a list of towns conquered by Tiglath, and ends thus: . . . "the town of Gaal (ad) . . . (A) bil . . . of the upper part of the land of Beth-Omri (i.e., Samaria) . . . in its whole extent I annexed to the territory of Assyria; my prefects the sagans I appointed over them." The fragment goes on to mention the flight of Han-n, king of Gaza, to Egypt, and the carrying off of his goods and his gods by the conqueror. It is added, "The land of Beth-Omri . . . the whole body of his men, their goods, to the land of Assyria I led away, <span class= "ital">Pakaha </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Pekah) their king I <span class= "ital">slew</span> (so Schrader;? 'they slew'), and <span class= "ital">A-u-si-ha </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Hoshea) . . . over them I appointed. Ten (talents of gold, 1,000 talents of silver) 1 received from them."<p>(30) <span class= "bld">Hoshea . . . slew him, and reigned in his stead.</span>--See the inscription of Tiglath Pileser, quoted in the last Note, from which, as Schrader remarks, it is clear that Hoshea only secured his hold on the crown by recognition of the suzerainty of Assyria. The brief record of Kmgs does not mention this; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm" title="Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.">2Kings 17:3</a> represents Hoshea as paying tribute to Shalmaneser IV., the successor of Tiglath.<p><span class= "bld">In the twentieth year of Jotham.</span>--This is a suspicious statement, as not agreeing with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-33.htm" title="Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

The writer is again exceedingly brief. Pekah's reign was a remarkable one, and might have furnished much material to the historian. In conjunction with Rezin of Damascus, he made war upon Judaea, defeated Ahaz with great loss (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>), and laid siege to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>). Ahaz called in the aid or' Assyria, and Tiglath-pileser made two expeditions into Palestine - the one mentioned in ver. 29, and another some years afterwards. In the latter he seems to have had the assistance of Hoshea, who, with his sanction, slew Pekah, and became king. The scanty notices of our author must be supplemented from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28.htm">2 Chronicles 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-8</a>; and the Assyrian inscriptions. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah King of Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the thirty-ninth or thirty-eighth year</span> (see the comment on ver. 23). Pekahiah's "two years" may not have been complete. <span class="cmt_word">Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.</span> The Assyrian records make this number impossible. Tiglath-pileser's entire reign lasted only eighteen years, yet it more than covered the entire reign of Pekah. When he first invaded the kingdom of Samaria, Menahem was upon the throne ('Eponym Canon,' p. 120, line 29); when he last attacked it, probably in <span class="date">B.C. 730</span> - two years before his death in <span class="date">B.C. 728</span> - he set up Hoshea, or, at any rate, sanctioned his usurpation (ibid., pp. 123, 124, lines 15-18). Pekah's entire reign must have come in the interval, which is certainly not more than one of fifteen, probably not more than one of ten years. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:8-31 This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not without troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel. The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. We have reason to be thankful for restraints, for being kept out of temptation, and should beg of God to renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
