(B.C. 745-727). The most important statement runs: "19 districts of the city of Hamath (<span class= "ital">Hammatti</span>) with the cities of their circuit, on the coast of the sea of the setting of the sun (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the Mediterranean), which in their transgression had revolted to Azariah, to the border of Assyria I restored, my prefects my governors over them I appointed." The Eponym list records a three years' campaign of Tiglath Pileser against the Syrian state of Arpad in B.C. 742-740. Schrader supposes that Azariah and Hamath were concerned in this campaign. (This conflicts with the ordinary chronology, which fixes 758 B.C. as the year of Azariah's death.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam King of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah King of Judah to reign.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a> it is distinctly stated that Jeroboam's reign of forty-one years commenced in the fifteenth of Amaziah, who from that time lived only fifteen years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-17.htm">2 Kings 14:17</a>). Either, therefore, Azariah must have begun to reign in the fifteenth year of Jeroboam, or there must have been an interregnum of twelve years between the death of Amaziah and the accession of Azariah. As this last hypothesis is pre-eluded by the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-20.htm">2 Kings 14:20, 21</a>, we must correct the, twenty-seventh year" of this verse into the "fifteenth."
