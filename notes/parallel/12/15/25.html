<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A captain of his</span> - "captain of a thousand," according to Josephus (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.) - <span class="cmt_word">conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house</span>;

"The Four Hundred" were probably the royal body-guard, which at this time may have consisted of Gileadites. <span class="cmt_word">And he killed him, and reigned in his room.</span> It does not appear that Pekah had any grievance. His crime seems to have been simply prompted by ambition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:8-31 This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not without troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel. The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. We have reason to be thankful for restraints, for being kept out of temptation, and should beg of God to renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
