Then the sense will simply be, that the Samaritans contemporary with the writer do not worship Jehovah according to the Torah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto this day</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the time at which Kings was written (about <span class="date">B.C. 580-560</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">they do after the former manners</span> - that is, they maintain the mixed religion, which they set up on the coming of the Samaritan priest from Assyria a hundred and fifty or sixty years previously - <span class="cmt_word">they fear not the Lord.</span> This statement seems directly opposed to the thrice-repeated one (vers. 32, 33, 41), "They feared the Lord;" but the apparent contradiction is easily reconciled. The new immigrants "feared Jehovah" in a certain sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> externally. They admitted him into their pantheon, and had ritual observances in his honor. But they did not really fear him in their hearts. Had they done so, they would have inquired what were his laws, statutes, and ordinances, and would have set themselves to obey them. This they did not think of doing. <span class="cmt_word">Neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances</span> - either the "statutes" and "ordinances" are regarded as having become <span class="accented">de jure</span> "<span class="accented">theirs"</span> by their occupation of the Holy Land, or "their" refers by anticipation to "the children of Jacob" towards the close of the verse - <span class="cmt_word">or after the Law</span> - rather, <span class="accented">and after the Law - <span class="cmt_word"></span>and commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:24-41 The terror of the Almighty will sometimes produce a forced or feigned submission in unconverted men; like those brought from different countries to inhabit Israel. But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken from him.</body></html>
