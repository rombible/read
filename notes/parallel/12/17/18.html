We have here the apodosis of the long sentence beginning with ver. 7 and continuing to the end of ver. 17. When all that is enumerated in these verses had taken place, then the Lord was moved to anger against Israel, then matters had reached a crisis, the cup of their iniquity was full, and God's wrath, long restrained, descended on them. <span class="cmt_word">And removed them out of his sight.</span> Removal out of God's sight is loss of his favor and of his care. "The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>) - he "knoweth their way," "watcheth ever them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>), "careth for them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>); but "the countenance of the Lord is against them [averted from them] who do evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>). He will not look upon them nor hear them. <span class="cmt_word">There was none left but the tribe of Judah only.</span> The "tribe of Judah" stands for the kingdom of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-23.htm">1 Kings 12:23</a>; '<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-18</a>), into which the greater part of Dan and Simeon had also been absorbed. This became now, exclusively, God's "peculiar people," the object of his love and of his care. The writer, it must be remembered, belongs to the period of the Captivity, and is not speaking of the restored Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-23 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
