In another passage he speaks of locating certain Arab tribes, including those of Tham-d and Ephah, in the land of Beth-Omri; and in a third passage of his annals he says that he "removed the rest" of these Arab tribes, "and caused them to dwell in the city of Samerina" (Samaria). This notice be. longs to Sargon's seventh year (715 B.C. ). Kuthah and Sepharvaim were also towns in Babylonia. The former is called <span class= "ital">Kutie</span> in the cuneiform inscriptions. It had a temple of Nergal and Laz, the ruins of which have been discovered at <span class= "ital">Tell-Ibrahim,</span> north-east of Babylon. Sepharvaim, in the cuneiform <span class= "ital">Sipar</span> and <span class= "ital">Sippar,</span> means "the two Sipars;" in allusion, probably, to the fact that the town was divided between the two deities <span class= "ital">Samas</span> (the sun), and <span class= "ital">Anunitum,</span> and bore the names of <span class= "ital">Sippar sa Samas</span> ("Sippara of the Sun"), and <span class= "ital">Sippar sa Anunitum</span> ("Sippara of Anunit").

It is, therefore, quite likely that he had, as usual, deported the conquered Hamathites, and, in fact, settled some of them in Samaria, as this verse relates.<p><span class= "bld">Placed them.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">made them dwell,</span> the very phrase used by Sargon himself in describing these arrangements (<span class= "ital">usesib</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> At a later period Esarhaddon reinforced these colonists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm" title="Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as you do; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up here.">Ezra 4:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-41.</span> <span class="accented">- Re-peopling of the kingdom of Israel by Assyrian colonists</span>, <span class="accented">and formation of a mixed religion</span>. The writer, before dismissing the subject of the Israelite kingdom, proceeds to inform us of certain results of the conquest. Having removed the bulk of the native inhabitants, the Assyrians did not allow the country to lie waste, but proceeded to replace the population which they had carried off by settlers from other localities (ver. 24). These settlers were, after a short time, incommoded by lions, which increased upon them, and diminished their numbers (ver. 25). The idea arose that the visitation was supernatural, and might be traced to the fact that the newcomers, not knowing "the manner of the God of the land," displeased him by the neglect of his rites or by the introduction of alien worship (ver. 26). A remedy for this was sought in the sending to them from Assyria one of the priests who had been carried off, from whom it was thought they might learn how "the God of the land" was to be propitiated. This was the orion of the "mixed religion" which grew up in the country. While the nations who had replaced the Israelites brought in their own superstitions, and severally worshipped their own gods (vers. 30, 31), there was a general acknowledgment of Jehovah by all of them, and a continuance of Jehovistic worship in the various high places. The nations both "feared the Lord, and served their graven images," down to the time when the writer of Kings composed his work (vers. 33-41). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria brought men from Babylon.</span> It has been supposed, in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>, that no colonists were introduced into the country till the time of Esarhaddon, who began to reign in <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. But this, which would be intrinsically most improbable (for when did a king forego his tribute from a fertile country for forty-one years?), is contradicted by a statement of Sargon, that he placed colonists there in <span class="date">B.C. 715</span> ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 415). These were not necessarily the first; and, on the whole, it is probable that the re-peopling of the country begun earlier. Hamath was reduced by Sargon in <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, and punished severely. Its inhabitants were carried off, and replaced by Assyrians ('Eponym Canon,' p. 127). Probably some of them were at once settled in Samaria. The conquest of Babylon by Sargon was not till later. It occurred in <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>, and was probably followed by the immediate deportation of some of its inhabitants to the same quarter. <span class="cmt_word">And from Cuthah.</span> "Cuthah," or "Cutha," was an important Babylonian city, often mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 74, 75; vol. 3. p. 35; vol. 5. pp. 93, 94, 102). Its ruins exist at the site now called Ibrahim, about fifteen miles northeast of Babylon. Sargon must have become master of it when he put down Merodach-Baladan and assumed the sovereignty of Babylonia, in <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>. Why the later Jews called the Samaritans "Cuthaeans," rather than Sepharvites, or Avites, or Hamathites, it is impossible to determine. Possibly the Cuthaean settlers preponderated in numbers ever the others. <span class="cmt_word">And from Ava.</span> "Ava" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) is probably the same as the Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a> and 2 Kings 19:13, and perhaps identical with the Ahava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) of Ezra (Ezra 8:15, 21). The city intended is thought to be the "Is" of Herodotus (1. 179), and the modern Hit. Hit lies upon the Euphrates, about a hundred and thirty miles above Babylon, in lat. 33&deg; 45' nearly. It is famous for its bitumen springs. <span class="cmt_word">And from Hamath</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 14:25). Hamath on the Orontes was conquered by Sargon in <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, two years after his capture of Samaria ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Its rude inhabitants were carried off, and Assyrians were placed there. <span class="cmt_word">And from Sepharvaim.</span> It is generally allowed that "Sepharvaim" is "Sippara," the dual form being accounted for by the fact that Sippara was a double town, partly on the right and partly on the left bank of a stream derived from the Euphrates. Hence Pliny speaks of it as "oppida Hipparenorum" ('Hist. Nat.,' 6:30). The exact site, at Abu-Habba, sixteen miles southwest of Baghdad, has only recently been discovered (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1885, vol. 8. pp. 172-176). <span class="cmt_word">And placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</span> Transplantation of nations, commenced by Tiglath-pileser, was practiced on a still larger scale by Sargon. The following summary will illustrate this point: "In all his wars Sargon largely employed the system of wholesale deportation. The Israelites were removed from Samaria, and planted partly in Gozan or Mygdonia, and partly in the cities recently taken from the Medes. Hamath and Damascus were peopled with captives from Armenia and other regions of the north. A portion of the Tibareni were carried captive to Assyria, and Assyrians were established in the Tibarenian country. Vast numbers of the inhabitants of the Zagros range were also transported to Assyria; Babylonians, Cuthaeans, Sapharrites, Arabians, and others were placed in Samaria; men from the extreme east (perhaps Media) in Ashdod. The Comukha were removed from the extreme north to Susiana, and Chaldaeans were brought from the extreme south to supply their places. Everywhere Sargon 'changed the abodes' of his subjects, his aim being, as it would seem, to weaken the stronger races by dispersion, and to destroy the spirit of the weaker ones by severing at a blow all the links which unite a patriotic people to the country it has long inhabited. The practice had not been unknown to previous monarchs; but it had never been employed by any of them so generally or on so grand a scale as it was by this king" (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 423). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:24-41 The terror of the Almighty will sometimes produce a forced or feigned submission in unconverted men; like those brought from different countries to inhabit Israel. But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken from him.</body></html>
