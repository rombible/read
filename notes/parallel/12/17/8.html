The Israelites had been repeatedly warned not to follow these (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-3.htm">Leviticus 18:3, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-14</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Whom the Lord east out from before the children of Israel</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Canaanitish nations, whose idolatries and other "<span class="accented">abominations"</span> were particularly hateful to God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-18.htm">Deuteronomy 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>, etc.) - <span class="cmt_word">and of the kings of Israel.</span> The sins and idolatries of Israel had a double origin. The great majority were derived from the heathen nations with whom they were brought into contact, and were adopted voluntarily by the people themselves. Of this kind were the worship at "<span class="accented">high</span> places" (ver. 9), the "<span class="accented">images"</span> and "groves" (ver. 10), the causing of their children to "pass through the fire" (ver. 17), the employment of divination and enchantments (ver. 17), and perhaps the "<span class="accented">worship</span> of the host of heaven" (ver. 16). A certain number, however, came in from a different source, being imposed upon the people by their kings. To this class belong the desertion of the temple-worship, enforced by Jeroboam (vex. 21), the setting up of the calves at Dan and Bethel (ver. 16) by the same, and the Baal and <span class="accented">Astarte</span> worship (ver. 16), introduced by Ahab. This last and worst idolatry was not established without a good deal of persecution, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Which they had made.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-23 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
