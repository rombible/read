As he had rejected the ten tribes on account of certain transgressions, which have been enumerated (vers. 8-17), so, when Judah committed the self-same sins, and transgressed equally, Judah had equally to be rejected. "<span class="accented">All</span> the seed of Israel" is the entire nation - Israel in the widest sense, made up of Judah and of Israel in the narrow sense. So Keil, rightly. <span class="cmt_word">And afflicted them</span> - by the hands of Sargon, and Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>), and Pharaoh-Nechoh, and others - <span class="cmt_word">and delivered them into the hands of spoilers.</span> The "spoilers" intended are probably, first, the "bands of the Chaldees, and of the Syrians, and of the Moabites, and of the children of Ammon," who were let loose upon Judaea by Nebuchadnezzar when Jehoiakim rebelled against him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>), and secondly Nebuchadnezzar himself and Nebuzaradan, who completed the spoliation of the country, and plundered Jerusalem itself, to punish the revolts of Jehoiachid and Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13-16</a> and 2 Kings 25:8-21), when all the treasures of the temple were carried off. <span class="cmt_word">Until he had cast them out of his sight</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> until he had punished Judah as he had previously punished Israel (ver. 18), which was what justice required. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-23 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
