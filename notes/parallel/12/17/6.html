The reign of Shalmaneser came to an end, and Sargon seated himself upon the throne. There have been commentators on Kings (Keil, Bahr) who have supposed that Shalmaneser and Sargon were the same person, and have even claimed that the Assyrian inscriptions support their view. But the fact is otherwise. Nothing is more certain than that, according to them, Sargon succeeded Shalmaneser IV. in <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> by a revolution, and was the head of a new dynasty. He claims in his annals, among his earliest acts, the siege and capture of Samaria ('Eponym Canon,' p. 125). It is remarkable that Scripture, while in no way connecting him with the capture, never distinctly assigns it to Shalmaneser. Here we are only told that "the King of Assyria" took it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9, 10</a>, where we are distinctly told that Shalmaneser "came up against Samaria, and besieged it," the capture is expressed by the phrase, "they took it," not "he took <span class="accented">it</span>." Perhaps neither king was present in person at the siege, or, at any rate, at its termination. The city may have been taken by an Assyrian general, while Shalmaneser and Sargon were contending for the crown. In that case, the capture might be assigned to either. Sargon certainly claims it; Shalmaneser's annals have been so mutilated by his successors that we cannot tell whether he claimed it or not. The city fell in <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>; and the deportation of its inhabitants at once took place. <span class="cmt_word">And carried Israel away into Assyria.</span> The inscription of Sargon above referred to mentions only the deportation, from the city of Samaria itself, of 27,290 persons. No doubt a vast number of others were carried off from the smaller towns and from the country districts. Still, the country was not left uninhabited, and Sargon assessed its tribute at the old rate ('Eponym Canon,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.). Nor was the cry of Samaria destroyed, since we hear of it subsequently more than once in the Assyrian annals. <span class="cmt_word">And placed them in Halah.</span> "Halah" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) has been supposed by some to be the old Assyrian city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>) of Calah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>), which was, down to the' time of Tiglath-pileser, the main capital; but the difference of spelling is an objection, and the Assyrians do not seem to have ever transported subject-populations to their capitals. It is moreover reasonable to suppose that Halah, Habor, Gozan, and Hara (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>) were in the same neighborhood. This last consideration points to the "Chalcitis" of Ptolemy (5. 18) as the true "Halah," since it was in the immediate vicinity of the Khabour, of Gauzanitis, and of Haran. <span class="cmt_word">And in Habor by the river of Gozan.</span> This is a mistranslation. The Hebrew runs, "And on Habor (Khabor), the river of Gozan" (so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>). "Habor, the river of Gozan," is undoubtedly one of the Khabours. Those who find Halah in Calah, or in Calacine (Calachene), generally prefer the eastern river which runs into the Tigris from Kurdistan a little below Jezireh. But there is no evidence that rids river bore the name in antiquity. The Western Khabour, on the other hand, was well known to the Assyrians under that appellation, and is the Aborrhas of Strabo and Procopius, the Chaboras of Pliny and Ptolemy, the Aburas of Isadore of Charax, and the Abora of Zosimus. It adjoins a district called Chalcitis, and it drains the country of Gauzanitis or Mygdonia. The Western Khabour is a river of Upper Mesopotamia, and runs into the Euphrates from the northeast near the site of the ancient Circesion. The tract which it drains is called Mygdonia by Strabo, Gauzanitis by Ptolemy. <span class="cmt_word">And in the cities of the Medes.</span> Media had been repeatedly invaded and ravaged by the Assyrians from the time of Vulnirari IV. (about <span class="date">B.C. 810</span>); but the first king to conquer any portion of it, and people its cities with settlers from other parts of his dominions, was Sargon (Oppert, ' Inscriptions des Sargonides,' pp. 25, 37). We learn from the present passage that a certain number of these settlers were Israelites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a> and Tobit 1:14). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 When the measure of sin is filled up, the Lord will forbear no longer. The inhabitants of Samaria must have endured great affliction. Some of the poor Israelites were left in the land. Those who were carried captives to a great distance, were mostly lost among the nations.</body></html>
