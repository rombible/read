It is uncertain whether he was Tiglath-pileser's son or a usurper. The name, Shalmaneser (<span class="accented">Sali-manu-uzur</span>) was an old royal name in Assyria, and signified "Shalman protects" (compare the names Nabu-kudur-uzur, Nergal-asar-uzur, Nabu-pal-uzur, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And Hoshea became his servant.</span> Hoshea had been placed on the throne by Tiglath-pileser ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123, 124, lines 17,18), and had paid him tribute (ibid., lines 18, 19). We must suppose that on Tiglath-pileser's death, in <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, he had revolted, and resumed his independence.
