This has been supposed to mean "in the twentieth year from the accession of Jotham," or, in other words, in the fourth year of Ahaz, since Jotham reigned only sixteen years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-33.htm">2 Kings 15:33</a>). But now the beginning of his reign is placed eight years later. An interregnum of this duration has been placed by some between Pekah and Doshea; but this is contradicted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, and also by an inscription of Tiglath-pileser ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123,124, lines 17, 18).
