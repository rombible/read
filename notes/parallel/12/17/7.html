Here, for once, the writer ceases to be the mere historian, and becomes the religious teacher and prophet, drawing out the lessons of history, and justifying the ways of God to man. <span class="accented">As</span> Bahr says, he "<span class="accented">does</span> not carry on the narrative as taken from the original authorities, but himself here begins a review of the history and fate of Israel, which <span class="accented">ends</span> with ver. 23, and forms an independent section by itself." The section divides itself into four portions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> From ver. 7 to ver. 12, a general statement of Israel's wickedness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from ver. 13 to ver. 15, a special aggravation of their guilt, viz. their rejection of prophets; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> vers: 16 and 17 contain a specification of their chief acts of sin; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> from ver. 18 to ver. 23, a general summary, including some words of warning to Judah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God</span>; rather, <span class="accented">And it came to pass</span>, <span class="accented">when</span>, etc. The clauses from the present to the end of ver. 17 depend on the "when" of this verse; the apodosis does not come till ver. 18, "When the children of Israel had done all that is stated in vers. 7-17, then the result was that the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight." <span class="cmt_word">Which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt.</span> So commencing his long series of mercies to the nation, and indicating his gracious favor towards it. "The deliverance from Egypt," as Bahr well says, "was not only the beginning, but the symbol, of all Divine grace towards Israel, and the pledge of its Divine guidance." Hence the stress laid upon it, both here and by the Prophet Hoses (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-9.htm">Hosea 12:9, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From under the hand</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the oppression - <span class="cmt_word">of Pharaoh King of Egypt, and had feared other gods</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reverenced and worshipped them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-23 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
