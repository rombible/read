While the allusions to Bethel, commonly called "Bethaven" (" House of nothingness" for "House of God "), are frequent in the Israelitish prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5, 8, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10-13</a>), there is but a single distinct allusion to Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). Bethel was "the king's chapel" and "the king's court" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-13.htm">Amos 7:13</a>). The priest selected by Sargon's advisers was a Bethelite priest, and, returning thither, took up the worship familiar to him. <span class="cmt_word">And taught them</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the new settlers <span class="cmt_word">- how they should fear the Lord.</span> This worship could only be that of the calf-priests instituted by Jeroboam, which was, however, most certainly a worship of Jehovah, and an imitation or travesty of the temple - worship at Jerusalem. Whether the returned priest set up a new calf-idol to replace the one which had been carried off to Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>), is doubtful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:24-41 The terror of the Almighty will sometimes produce a forced or feigned submission in unconverted men; like those brought from different countries to inhabit Israel. But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken from him.</body></html>
