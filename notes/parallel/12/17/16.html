Schlottmann writes: "That Ashera was only another name for the same supreme goddess (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Ashtoreth) is at once shown by the parallelism of 'Baal and Ashtaroth' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.">Judges 2:13</a>) with 'Baal and Asherim' (the plural of Ashera) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>. In quite the same way Baal and Ashera stand side by side in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Judges 6:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm" title="And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.">2Kings 23:4</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm" title="Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.">1Kings 18:19</a> the 450 prophets of the Baal and the 400 of the Ashera. further, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.">2Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-18.htm" title="And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.">2Chronicles 24:18</a>, the LXX. render Ashera by Astarte; and in other passages Aquila, Symmachus, and the Peshito do the same thing." He then refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm" title="For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.">1Kings 14:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-8.htm" title="And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.">Isaiah 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a>, and continues: "according to these and many other passages, <span class= "ital">Ashera</span> was used as the designation of the commonest material representation of the goddess. It consisted of a block of wood, of considerable size (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-26.htm" title="And build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which you shall cut down.">Judges 6:26</a>), and resembling a tree, as is shown by the expressions used in connection with it, such as <span class= "ital">'</span>setting up,' 'planting,' and 'cutting down' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm" title="And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:">2Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Judges 6:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm" title="He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.">2Kings 18:4</a>, &c). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a> the LXX. actually renders tree; 'and so the Peshito in Deut. vi 21, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-13.htm" title="Your graven images also will I cut off, and your standing images out of the middle of you; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.">Micah 5:13</a>. Hence, we must not think of pillars like the Greek Hermae, but of a <span class= "ital">real trunk planted in the ground, rootless, but not branchless;</span> for which purpose pines and evergreens were preferred. The <span class= "ital">tree</span> signifies, according to an ancient and widespread conception, <span class= "ital">nature,</span> or <span class= "ital">the world,</span> which in this case stands as goddess at the side of the Baal----<span class= "ital">the lord</span> of the world. (Comp. the Norse tree, Yggdrasil, and the Assyrian sacred tree.) Hence, the Ashera was set up by the altar of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Judges 6:28</a>).

Schlottmann adds that Movers is wrong in making Astarte and Ashera two different goddesses, the former being "the stern, cruel virgin," the latter, "the goddess who excites to pleasure;" and he justly observes that, as in the case of Baal, the same deity may be conceived under contrary aspects (Riehm's <span class= "ital">Handworterbuch Bibl. Alterthums,</span> pp. Ill--114). For the Hebrew conception of Astarte see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.">Jeremiah 44:17</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span> Kuenen, <span class= "ital">Rel. of Isr. i.</span> 88 <span class= "ital">seq.,</span> agrees with Movers, but hardly proves his case.<p><span class= "bld">Worshipped all the host of heaven.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm" title="For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.">2Kings 21:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm" title="And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.">2Kings 23:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - The main sins of Israel are now specified, that they themselves may stand self-convicted, and that others may be warned against doing the like. First, generally. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They left all the commandments of the Lord their God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> neglected them, rendered them no obedience, offered none of the stated sacrifices, attended none of the appointed feasts, broke the moral law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1, 2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-1.htm">Hosea 7:1</a>, etc.) by swearing, and lying, and stealing, and committing adultery, by drunkenness, and lewdness, and bloodshed. <span class="cmt_word">And made them molten images, even two calves.</span> These at least were undeniable - there they were at Dan and Bethel, until the Captivity came (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>), worshipped, sworn by (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>), viewed as living gods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>), offered to, trusted in. Every king had upheld them, so that Bethel was regarded as "the king's court," and "the king's chapel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-13.htm">Amos 7:13</a>); all the people were devoted to them, and "brought their sacrifices to Bethel every morning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>), "and their tithes after three years." <span class="cmt_word">And made a grove.</span> The "grove "(<span class="accented">asherah</span>) which Ahab set up at Samaria (1 Kings 16:38), and which remained there certainly to the time of Jehoahaz (see the comment on 2 Kings 13:6). <span class="cmt_word">And worshipped all the host of heaven.</span> This worship had not been mentioned before; and it is nowhere else ascribed to the Israelites of the northern kingdom. Manasseh seems to have introduced it into Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5, 11</a>). Such knowledge as we have of the Western Asiatic religions seems to indicate that <span class="accented">astral</span> worship, strictly so called, was a peculiarity of the Assyro-Babylonian and Arabian systems only, and did not belong to the Syrian, or the Phoenician, or the Canaanite. It may be suspected that the present passage is somewhat rhetorical, and assigns to the Israelites the "worship of the host of heaven," simply because an astral character attached to Baal and Ashtoreth, who were associated in the religion of the Phoenicians with the sun and moon. On the ether hand, it is just possible that the Assyro-Babylonian star-worship had been introduced into Israel under Menahem, Pekah, or Hoshea. <span class="cmt_word">And served Baal.</span> The Baal-worship, introduced by Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>), was not finally abolished by Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-28.htm">2 Kings 10:28</a>). Like other popular religions, it had a revival Hosea, writing under the later kings from Jeroboam II. to Hoshea, alludes to the Baal-worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8, 17</a>) as continuing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-23 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
