Their ravages were understood by the colonists as a token of the wrath of the local deity on account of their neglect of his worship. The sacred writer endorses this interpretation of the incident, probably remembering <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm" title="I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.">Leviticus 26:22</a>.

They brought with them their own forms of heathenism (see vers. 30, 31). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the Lord sent lions among them.</span> Lions are not now found in Palestine, nor indeed in any part of Syria, though they are numerous in Mesopotamia; but anciently they appear to have been tolerably common in all parts of the Holy Land (see the comment on 1 Kings 13:24). We may gather from what is said here that, though new settlers had been brought into the country by the Assyrians, yet still there had been a considerable decrease in the population, which had been favorable to the lions multiplying. The new settlers, it is to be noted, were placed in the towns (ver. 24); and it is probable that many of the country districts lay waste and desolate. Still, the writer views the <span class="accented">great</span> increase in the number of the lions as a Divine judgment, which it may have been, though based upon a natural circumstance. <span class="cmt_word">Which slew some of them.</span> (For the great boldness of the Palestinian lion, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-36.htm">1 Kings 20:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-13.htm">Proverbs 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>, etc.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:24-41 The terror of the Almighty will sometimes produce a forced or feigned submission in unconverted men; like those brought from different countries to inhabit Israel. But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken from him.</body></html>
