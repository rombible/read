This was the covenant which Israel had been warned so frequently not to "forget" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-13.htm">Deuteronomy 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>), yet which they had "forgotten," or, at any rate, "forsaken," as already declared in ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall ye fear other gods.</span> The writer has probably a practical object in his reiteration. He expects his words to reach the ears of the mixed race inhabiting Samaria in his day, and would fain warn them against their idolatrous practices, and point them to the pure worship of Jehovah. It is pleasing to remember that ultimately the mixed race was won to the true faith, and that the Samaritans of our Lord's time were as true worshippers of Jehovah, and as zealous followers of the Law, as the Jews themselves. The interesting community at Nablous still maintains Samaritan forms, and reads the Samaritan Pentateuch. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:24-41 The terror of the Almighty will sometimes produce a forced or feigned submission in unconverted men; like those brought from different countries to inhabit Israel. But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken from him.</body></html>
