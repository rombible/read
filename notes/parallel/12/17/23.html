But henceforth "the distinctive character of the nation was lost; such Hebrews as remained in their old land became mixed with their heathen neighbours. When Josiah destroyed the ancient high places of the northern kingdom he slew their priests, whereas the priests of Judaean sanctuaries were provided for at Jerusalem. It is plain from this that he regarded the worship of the northern sanctuaries as purely heathenish (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-20.htm" title="And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burned men's bones on them, and returned to Jerusalem.">2Kings 23:20</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-5.htm" title="Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.">2Kings 17:5</a>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and it was only in much later times that the mixed population of Samaria became possessed of the Pentateuch, and set up a worship on Mount Gerizim, in imitation of the ritual of the second Temple. We have no reason to think that the captive Ephraimites were more able to retain their distinctive character than their brethren who remained in Palestine. The problem of the lost tribes, which has so much attraction for some speculators, is a purely fanciful one. The people whom Hosea and Amos describe were not fitted to maintain themselves apart from the heathen among whom they dwelt. Scattered among strange nations, they accepted the service of strange gods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-64.htm" title="And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone.">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>), and, losing their distinctive religion, lost also their distinctive existence."

General warnings and denunciations had been given by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>, etc.), by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-4</a>), and probably by the entire series of prophets enumerated in the comment on ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> up to the time that the Second Book of Kings was written, about <span class="date">B.C. 580-560</span>, the Israelites remained within the limits of the country to which they were carried by the conqueror. Not long after this time, about <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, a considerable number returned with Zerubbabel to Palestine, and others with Ezra (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-13.htm">Ezra 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>-<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13</a>). What became of the rest has been a fertile subject of speculation. Probably the more religions united with the Jewish communities, which were gradually formed in almost all the cities of the East; while the irreligious laid aside their peculiar customs, and became blended indistinguishably with the heathen. 'There is no ground for expecting to find the "ten tribes" anywhere at the present day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-23 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
