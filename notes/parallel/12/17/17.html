The sin of child-murder had not Been previously laid to the charge of Israel; but, as it had infected Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>), there is no reason why it should not have invaded also the sister kingdom. Perhaps it is alluded to by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-2.htm">Hosea 5:2</a>; and Hosea 6:8.

Magical practices always accompanied idolatry, and were of many kinds. Sometimes divination was by means of staves or rods (rhabdomancy), which were manipulated in various ways (Herod., 4:67; Schol. ad Nicandr., 'Theriac.,' 613; Tacit., 'German.,' &sect; 10; Atom. Marc., 31:2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>). Sometimes it was by arrows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>). Very often, especially in Greece and Rome, it was by inspecting the entrails of victims. Where faith in God wanes, a trust in magical practices, astrology, chiromancy, "sertes Virgilianae," horoscopes, spirit-rapping, and the like, almost always supervenes. <span class="cmt_word">And sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.</span> (On the expression, "sold themselves to do evil," see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-23 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
