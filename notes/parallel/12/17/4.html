This statement seems to imply that Shalmaneser took Hoshea prisoner <span class= "ital">before</span> the siege of Samaria: a supposition which finds support in the fact that Sargon, who ended the siege, makes no mention of the capture or death of the Israelite king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So, King of Egypt.</span> We learn from the Prophet Hosea that the expediency of calling in Egypt as a counterpoise to Assyria had long been in the thoughts of those who directed the policy of the Israelite state (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>, etc.). Now at last the plunge was taken. An Ethiopian dynasty of some strength and vigor had possession of Egypt, and held its court during some part of the year at Memphis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>). The king who occupied the throne was called Shabak or Shebek - a name which the Greeks represented by Sabakos or Sevechus, and the Hebrews by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>. (The original vocalization of this word was probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Seveh</span>; but in later times this vocalization was lost, and the Masorites pointed the word as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Soh</span> or So). The Assyrians knew the king as Sibakhi, and contended with him under Sargon. Hoshea now sent an embassy to this monarch's court, requesting his alliance and his support against the great Asiatic power by which the existence of all the petty states of Western Asia was threatened. Shalmaneser was at the time endeavoring to capture Tyro, and Hoshea might reasonably fear that, when Tyre was taken, his own turn would come. It is not clear how Shabak received Hoshea's overtures; but we may, perhaps, assume that it was with favor, since otherwise Hoshea would scarcely have ventured to withhold his tribute, as he seems to have done. It must have been in reliance on "the strength of Egypt" that he ventured to brave the anger of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">And brought no present</span> - or, <span class="accented">sent no tribute - <span class="cmt_word"></span>to the King of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the King of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</span> The ultimate result is mentioned at once, before the steps by which it was accomplished are related. Shalmaneser did not "summon Hoshea before his presence to listen to his explanations," and then, "as soon as he came, take him prisoner, put him in chains, and imprison him" (as Ewald thinks), but simply declared war, invaded Hoshea's country, besieged him in his capital, and ultimately, when he surrendered, consigned him to a prison, as Nebuchadnezzar afterwards did Jehoiachin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Otherwise Hoshea's reign would have come to an end in his sixth or seventh, and not in his ninth year. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 When the measure of sin is filled up, the Lord will forbear no longer. The inhabitants of Samaria must have endured great affliction. Some of the poor Israelites were left in the land. Those who were carried captives to a great distance, were mostly lost among the nations.</body></html>
