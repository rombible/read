The arms which David had laid up in the Temple as spoils of war were now to be used, appropriately enough, for the restoration of David's heir to the throne. Possibly, as Bahr suggests, the guards who came off duty at the palace had left their weapons there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give King David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the Lord.</span> We hear of David carrying with him to Jerusalem the "shields of gold," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shields ornamented with gold, which he took from the servants of Hadadezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>); but otherwise we are not told of his establishing an armory. Solomon made six hundred shields of solid gold, and laid them up in the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>); but these were carried off by Sheshonk, when he invaded Judaea in the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>). Rehoboam, in their place, made three hundred brazen shields (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>), which, however, were deposited in the guard-chamber of the royal palace. Of spears collected by David, and laid up in the temple, we know nothing beyond the present passage. There can be little doubt that the weapons were brought forth from their receptacle with the view (as Ewald says) of "consecrating the work of the restoration of the Davidic house with the sacred arms of the great founder himself" (see 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 136) - not, however, with arms that he had worn, but with some which he had collected and laid up. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-12 Athaliah destroyed all she knew to be akin to the crown. Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out. Say, Let the King, even Jesus, live, for ever live and reign in my soul, and in all the world.</body></html>
