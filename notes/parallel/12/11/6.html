And he sat on the throne of the kings.">2Kings 11:19</a> "the gate of the Couriers" is mentioned, apparently as the principal entrance to the palace enclosure. That gate and this one are probably the same. It is here called "the gate <span class= "ital">behind</span> the Couriers" because a guard was usually stationed in front of it. Perhaps the word "behind" has originated in a mere echo of the word "gate" ('<span class= "ital">ahar, sha'ar</span>), and should be omitted as an error of transcription.<p><span class= "bld">So shall ye keep the watch of the house.</span>--Thus shall ye--the three divisions of the guards, entering on duty on the Sabbath--guard the entrances and exits of the royal palace.<p><span class= "bld">That it be not broken down.</span>--The Hebrew is only the one word <span class= "ital">mass?h,</span> which occurs nowhere else. It appears to mean "repulse," "warding off," and is probably a marginal gloss on "watch" (<span class= "ital">mishmereth</span>), explaining its nature--viz., that the guards were to keep back any one who tried to enter the palace buildings. Gesenius paraphrases, "ad depellendum populum" (<span class= "ital">zum Abwehren</span>). Thenius suggests the reading "and repel"! <span class= "ital">scil</span>., "all comers" (<span class= "ital">-nes?ah</span> for <span class= "ital">mass?h</span>).

It seems to be called in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a>) "the gate of the foundation" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>) instead of "the gate of Sur" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>), as here - the one reading having evidently arisen out of the other by a corruption. We must understand one of the <span class="accented">palace</span> gates, but which of them is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">And a third part at the gate behind the guard</span>; called in ver. 19 "the gate of the <span class="accented">guard</span>," and shown there to have been on the <span class="accented">cast</span> side of the palace, where it faced the temple, and abutted on the Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">So shall ye keep the watch of the house</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the "king's house," or palace, which is contrasted with the "house of the Lord" of the next verse - <span class="cmt_word">that it be not broken down.</span> This rendering is scarcely accepted at the present time by any writers. Ewald renders, "according to custom;" Keil, "for defense;" Furst, "alternately;" our Revisers, "and be a barrier." The Hebrew word used occurs nowhere else, and it seems impossible to determine its sense. The LXX. simply omit it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-12 Athaliah destroyed all she knew to be akin to the crown. Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out. Say, Let the King, even Jesus, live, for ever live and reign in my soul, and in all the world.</body></html>
