In the fervour of their newly-awakened enthusiasm for Jehovah, the assembly may have hurried off at once to the work of demolition. It seems to be implied that the "house of Baal" stood on the Temple mount, in ostentatious rivalry with the sanctuary of Jehovah. (Comp, the introduction of idolatrous altars into the Temple itself by Manasseh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/21-4.htm" title="And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.">2Kings 21:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-7.htm" title="And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:">2Kings 21:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>.) This house of Baal had, perhaps, been built by Athaliah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1Kings 16:31-32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">His altars . . . his images.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">its</span> (the Temple's) <span class= "ital">altars . . . its images.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord.</span>--The obviously close connection of this statement with what precedes, almost proves that the sanctuary of Baal had stood within the Temple precincts, probably in the outer court. After the destruction of it, Jehoiada appointed certain overseers--probably Levites of rank--to prevent any future desecration of the Temple by the practice of idolatrous rites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/8-5.htm" title="Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.">Ezekiel 8:5-16</a>), or by wanton attacks of the Baal-worshippers, who might be cowed, but were certainly not exterminated (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm" title="For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow on Baalim.">2Chronicles 24:7</a>); and to see that the legitimate <span class= "ital">cultus</span> was properly carried out. (The sentence tells us what was done some time afterwards, in consequence of the reformation; thus finishing the subject in hand at the expense of the strict order of time.)<p><span class= "bld">Mattan.</span>--Mattan is short for Mattanbaal, "gift of Baal," a Ph?nician name occurring in Punic and Assyrian inscriptions (the Muthumballes of Plautus). Comp. also <span class= "ital">Mitinna and Matten,</span> as names of Tyrian kings (Inscr. of Tig. Pil. ii.; Herod. Vii. 98).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people of the land</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all those who had come up to Jerusalem from the various cities of Judah to help Jehoiada (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">went into the house of Baal.</span> According to Josephus, "the house of Baal" here mentioned was built by Jehoram and Athaliah in the reign of the former ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 4), But, if this was the case, it is rather strange that the writer of Chronicles, who enumerates so many of the evil acts of Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4, 6, 11</a>), does not mention it. The present narrative shows that the temple was in, or very near, Jerusalem; but there is nothing to fix the site of it. <span class="cmt_word">And brake it down</span> - Josephus says they "razed it to the ground" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly.</span> It was common among the heathen to have several altars in one temple, and not uncommon to have several images even of the same god, especially if he was a god worshipped under different forms, as Baal was (whence the word "Baalim"). The Baalim of this temple are mentioned by the writer of Chronicles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</span> The name "Mattan" recalls that of the last King of Judah, which was originally Mattaniah, equivalent to "gift of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Mattan would be simply "gift." We may presume that, though only called "priest," he was the high priest. <span class="cmt_word">And the priest</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiada - <span class="cmt_word">appointed officers over the house of the Lord.</span> The parallel passage of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18, 19</a>) explains this statement. We are there told that "Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the priests the Levites... to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David. And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which was unclean in anything should enter in." During Athaliah's reign the temple service had ceased; breaches had been broken in the outer walls; and neither the priests nor the porters had served in their regular order; there had been no morning or evening sacrifice, and no antiphonal psalm-singing. Jehoiada re-established the regular courses and the worship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:17-21 King and people would cleave most firmly to each other, when both had joined themselves to the Lord. It is well with a people, when all the changes that pass over them help to revive, strengthen, and advance the interests of religion among them. Covenants are of use, both to remind us of, and bind us to, the duties already binding on us. They immediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with one another, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The people rejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet. The way for people to be joyful and at peace, is to engage fully in the service of God; for the voice of joy and thanksgiving is in the dwellings of the righteous, but there is no peace for the wicked.</body></html>
