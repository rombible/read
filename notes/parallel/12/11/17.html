The king being at present a mere puppet in his hands, Jehoiada had to determine the next steps which were necessary to be taken. These, in his judgment, were three. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A solemn covenant must be made between the king and the people; and another between the king, the people, and God - the latter pledging the king and people to maintain the worship of Jehovah, and never again to apostatize; the former pledging the king to govern according to law, and the people to remain faithful to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The temple of Baal, erected in Jerusalem at the instance of Athaliah, must be destroyed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The king must be removed from the temple and installed in the palace of his ancestors. A brief account of these proceedings concludes the present chapter. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people.</span> In the original it is "made the covenant;" and the meaning is that the high priest renewed the old covenant understood to exist between king and people on the one hand and God on the other, that they would be faithful to God and God to them - that they would maintain his worship, and that he would continue his protection (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-10.htm">Exodus 34:10-28</a>). The apostasy of Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Athaliah was regarded as having put an end to the old covenant, and therefore it was solemnly remade or renewed. <span class="cmt_word">That they should be the Lord's people</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-29.htm">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>, etc.); <span class="cmt_word">between the king also and the people.</span> The terms of this covenant are nowhere distinctly stated, but we can only suppose them to have expressed in words the intention of that novel act, the imposition of "the testimony" upon the head of the king at the time of his coronation (see the comment upon ver. 12). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:17-21 King and people would cleave most firmly to each other, when both had joined themselves to the Lord. It is well with a people, when all the changes that pass over them help to revive, strengthen, and advance the interests of religion among them. Covenants are of use, both to remind us of, and bind us to, the duties already binding on us. They immediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with one another, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The people rejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet. The way for people to be joyful and at peace, is to engage fully in the service of God; for the voice of joy and thanksgiving is in the dwellings of the righteous, but there is no peace for the wicked.</body></html>
