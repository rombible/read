the former exulting in their work, the latter not lifting a finger while the idolatrous tyrant was being put to death " (connecting the first half of the verse with the second; after Ewald). But his assumption that "all the people of the land," here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-14.htm" title="And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.">2Kings 11:14</a>, means "the soldiery" ("die ganze in Jerusalem anwesende Kriegerische Landesmannschaft--Die Kriegsmannschaft") is certainly wrong. "The people of the land" are plainly opposed to the royal guards--"the Praetorians"--who effected the revolution, as civilians to soldiers.<p><span class= "bld">The city was in quiet.</span>--The citizens of Jerusalem accepted the revolution without attempting any counter movement. No doubt there was a strong element of Baal-worshippers and partisans of Athaliah in the capital. "The people of the land" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, probably, the people whom the centurions had called together from the country, at the instance of Jehoiada, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-2.htm" title="And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 23:2</a>) are contrasted with the burghers of Jerusalem. The phrase, "the city was in quiet" (or "had rest," <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might.

The <span class="accented">whole land</span> was content with the revolution that had taken place. No opposition showed itself. Ewald has no ground for his statement that the heathenizing party was strong in Jerusalem, and that the worshippers of Jehovah "had for a long time to keep watch in the temple, to prevent surprise by the heathenizing party" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 136, note 3). He has mistaken the intention of the last clause of ver. 18. If anything is clear from the entire narrative of the early reign of Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-3.htm">2 Kings 11:3-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-1.htm">2 Chronicles 24:1-14</a>), it is that there was no heathenizing party in Jerusalem, or none that dared to show itself, until after the death of the high priest Jehoiada, which was later than the twenty-third year of Joash. <span class="cmt_word">And the city</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jerusalem - <span class="cmt_word">was in quiet: and they slew</span> - it might he translated, <span class="accented">when they had slain</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.</span> The intention of the writer is to connect the period of tranquility with the removal of Athaliah, and therefore to point her out as the cause of disturbance previously. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:17-21 King and people would cleave most firmly to each other, when both had joined themselves to the Lord. It is well with a people, when all the changes that pass over them help to revive, strengthen, and advance the interests of religion among them. Covenants are of use, both to remind us of, and bind us to, the duties already binding on us. They immediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with one another, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The people rejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet. The way for people to be joyful and at peace, is to engage fully in the service of God; for the voice of joy and thanksgiving is in the dwellings of the righteous, but there is no peace for the wicked.</body></html>
