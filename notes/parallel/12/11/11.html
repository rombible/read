No one, it must be remembered, was ever allowed to enter inside the sanctuary but the priests and officiating Levites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>). And the temple. "The temple" is here the sanctuary, as in the passage of Chronicles just quoted.

Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out. Say, Let the King, even Jesus, live, for ever live and reign in my soul, and in all the world.</body></html>
