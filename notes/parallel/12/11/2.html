So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.">2Chronicles 22:11</a>.) This marriage with a sister of the king shows what almost royal dignity belonged to the high priest's office.<p><span class= "bld">The king's sons which were slain.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">which were to be put to death</span>. At the time when the order for slaying the princes had been given, Jehosheba (or Jehoshabeath; Chronicles) concealed the infant Joash. The fact of his infancy caused him to be overlooked. [The Hebrew text here reads by mistake a word meaning deaths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm" title="They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung on the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.">Jeremiah 16:4</a>). Chronicles supports the Hebrew margin.]<p><span class= "bld">And they hid him.</span>--This clause is out of its place here. The Hebrew is, <span class= "ital">him and his nurse in the chamber of the beds; and they hid him from Athaliah, and he was not put to death.</span> Clearly the word, "and she put," supplied in Chronicles, has fallen out before this. The Targum and Syriac read, "and she hid him and his nurse," &c.<p><span class= "bld">In the bedchamber.</span>--<span class= "ital">In the chamber of beds, i.e.</span>, the room in the palace where the mattresses and the coverlets were kept, according to a custom still prevalent in the East.

Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out.
