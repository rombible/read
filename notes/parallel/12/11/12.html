perhaps from a side chamber, or perhaps from the sanctuary itself.<p><span class= "bld">And gave him the testimony.</span>--The Hebrew has simply <span class= "ital">and the testimony</span>. Kimchi explains this to mean <span class= "ital">a royal robe</span>; other rabbis think of a phylactery on the coronet. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm" title="And you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>.) Thenius says, <span class= "ital">the Law--i.e.</span>, a book in which were written Mosaic ordinances, and which was held in a symbolic manner over the king's head after he had been crowned. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-11.htm" title="Then they brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.">2Chronicles 23:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Anointed him.</span>--The chronicler says it was "Jehoiada and his sons" who did it. It is difficult to see what objection can fairly be taken to this explanatory addition, unless we are to suppose that, although the high priest was present, the soldiers of the guard poured the sacred oil on the king's head. Yet Thenius adduces it as an instance of the "petty spirit of the chronist," accusing him of inserting the words "for fear anybody should think of an anointing by unconsecrated hands." Surely such criticism as this is itself both "petty" and "wilful." The words probably stood in the chronicler's principal source.<p><span class= "bld">God save the king.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Vivat rex</span>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-25.htm" title="For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.">1Kings 1:25</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiada - <span class="cmt_word">brought forth the king's son</span> - produced him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the chamber or chambers where he had been concealed hitherto. (On the temple chambers, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4-9</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And put the crown upon him.</span> That the Israelite kings actually wore crowns appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-2.htm">1 Chronicles 20:2</a>. The crown was probably a band of gold, either plain or set with jewels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a>), fastened behind with a riband. It receives here the same name that is given to the high priest's diadem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a> and Exodus 39:30. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him the testimony.</span> The words "gave him" are not in the original, and are superfluous. What is meant plainly is that the high priest laid on the young king's head a copy of the Law, or of some essential portion of it, perhaps the Decalogue, which is often called "the testimony" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16, 21</a>, etc.). The object apparently was to show that the king was to rule by law, not arbitrarily - that he was to be, as Dean Stanley says, "not above, but beneath, the law of his country" ('Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 397). The ceremony seems to have been a new one, and is indicative of the gradual curtailment of the regal power under the later monarchy. <span class="cmt_word">And they made him king, and anointed him.</span> A change is made from the singular to the plural, because, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-11.htm">2 Chronicles 23:11</a>, "Jehoiada <span class="accented">and his</span> sons anointed him." We have had no mention of the anointing of a new monarch in Judah since the time of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>). It may, however, have been the usual practice. <span class="cmt_word">And they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people - all who were present - <span class="cmt_word">clapped their hands</span> - an ordinary sign of joy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-1.htm">Psalm 47:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-8.htm">Psalm 98:8</a>; Isaiah 4:12; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>, etc.) - <span class="cmt_word">and said, God save the king!</span> literally, <span class="accented">long live the king</span>! (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-16.htm">2 Samuel 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-25.htm">1 Kings 1:25, 39</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-12 Athaliah destroyed all she knew to be akin to the crown. Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out. Say, Let the King, even Jesus, live, for ever live and reign in my soul, and in all the world.</body></html>
