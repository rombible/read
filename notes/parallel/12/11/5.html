The troops of the royal guard regularly succeeded each other on duty just as they do in modern European capitals. That the Sabbath was the day on which they relieved each other is known only from this passage; but the priestly and Levitical guilds did the same, and their organisation in many ways resembled that of an army.<p><span class= "bld">The watch of the king's house.</span>--There were two places to be occupied for the success of the present movement--viz., the royal palace and the Temple, "the king's house" and "the house of the Lord." In the former was Athaliah, the usurping queen, whose movements must be closely watched, and whose adherents must be prevented from occupying and defending the palace; in the latter, the young heir to the throne, who must be protected from attack. That "the king's house" here means the palace proper is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-16.htm" title="And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.">2Kings 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm" title="And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.">2Kings 11:19</a>, and, indeed, from the whole narrative. The LXX. adds, "at the entry" (<span class= "greekheb">?? ?? ??????</span>)--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the grand entrance to the palace itself. This is at least a correct gloss, and may be part of the original text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do.</span> It is evident, from 2 Chronicles and from Josephus, that a considerable interval of time separates the events of ver. 5 from those of ver. 4. The <span class="accented">immediate</span> arrangement made between Jehoiada and the centurions was that they should "go throughout the whole land" (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 2), visit "all the cities of Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), and gather out of them a strong force of Levites and priests (Josephus), together with a certain number of other representative Israelites, which force they should bring with them to Jerusalem, and place at his disposal. To accomplish this must have taken some weeks. When the force had arrived, Jehoiada summoned it to meet him in the courts of the temple, and swore it to a similar covenant to that which he had made with the centurions. He then bided his time, completed his arrangements, utilized the store of arms laid up in the temple armory (ver. 10), and finally gave two charges - one to the centurions, which is given here (vers. 5-8), and the other to the force collected from the cities of Judah, which is given in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>). The orders given to the two forces were very similar, but not identical. <span class="cmt_word">A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath.</span> The royal body-guard consisted of five divisions, each probably of a hundred men, and each commanded by its own captain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>). It was usual on the sabbath for three divisions out of the five to mount guard at the royal palace, while two were engaged outside, keeping order in the city, and especially at the temple. We do not know the ordinary disposition of the guard, either inside or outside the palace. On this occasion Jehoiada commanded that the palace-guard should be disposed as follows: one division at the palace proper, in the courts and halls and antechambers; a second at one of the issues from the palace, known as "the gate of Sur;" and a third at an issue called "the gate of the guard," which was certainly towards the east, where the palace fronted the temple. The object was to secure the palace, but not to prevent the queen from leaving it. <span class="cmt_word">Shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the royal palace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-12 Athaliah destroyed all she knew to be akin to the crown. Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out. Say, Let the King, even Jesus, live, for ever live and reign in my soul, and in all the world.</body></html>
