It was unquestionably through her influence that Jehoram was prevailed upon to introduce the Baal-worship into Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-5.htm">2 Chronicles 2:5, 11</a>), and Ahaziah prevailed upon to maintain it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-27.htm">2 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3</a>, "He also Talked in the ways of the house of Ahab: <span class="accented">for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly"</span>). On the death of Ahaziah, she found her position seriously imperiled. The crown would have passed naturally to one of her grandchildren, the eldest of the sons of Ahaziah. She would have lost her position of <span class="accented">gebirah</span>, or queen mother, which would have passed to the widow of Ahaziah, the mother of the new sovereign. If she did not at once lose all influence, at any rate a counter-influence to hers would have been established; and this might well have been that of the high priest, who was closely connected by marriage with the royal family. Under these circumstances, she took the bold resolution described in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">She arose and destroyed the seed royal.</span> She issued her orders, and had all the members of the house of David on whom she could lay her hands put to death. The royal house had already been greatly depleted by Jehoram's murder of his brothers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>), by Arab marauders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>), and by Jehu's murder of the "brethren of Ahaziah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-14.htm">2 Kings 10:14</a>); but it is clear that Ahaziah had left several sons behind him, and some of his "brethren" had also, in all probability, left issue. There may also have been many other descendants of David in Judah, belonging to other branches of the house than that of Rehoboam. Athaliah, no doubt, endeavored to make a clean sweep, and get rid of them all. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-12 Athaliah destroyed all she knew to be akin to the crown. Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out. Say, Let the King, even Jesus, live, for ever live and reign in my soul, and in all the world.</body></html>
