(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-3.htm" title="And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.">2Kings 23:3</a>.) The stand (Vulg., "tribunal") was apparently a dais reserved for the king only, which stood before the great altar, at the entrance to the inner court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-13.htm" title="And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.">2Chronicles 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm" title="For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court: and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.">2Chronicles 6:13</a>). Thenius maintains that the king stood on the top of the flight of steps leading into the sanctuary. Why, then, does not the text express this meaning more exactly? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-13.htm" title="Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.">2Kings 9:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">As the manner was</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, according to the custom on such occasions.<p><span class= "bld">The princes.</span>--The chiefs of the people, <span class= "ital">not</span> the centurions of the royal guard, who have their <span class= "ital">full</span> designation throughout the chapter. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm" title="And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.">2Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/11-9.htm" title="And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.">2Kings 11:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-15.htm" title="But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that follows her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.">2Kings 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm" title="And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.">2Kings 11:19</a>.) The present account has nowhere stated that the nobles were present in the Temple; but this sudden mention of them, as if they had been present throughout the proceedings, is in striking harmony with the chronicler's express assertion that, after their conference with Jehoiada, the centurions of the guard assembled the Levites and <span class= "ital">the heads of the clans</span> in the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD has said of the sons of David.">2Chronicles 23:3</a>). (The LXX. and Vulg. render "singers," because they read <span class= "ital">sh?rim</span>, "singers," instead of <span class= "ital">s?rim</span>, "princes.")<p><span class= "bld">The trumpeters.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the trumpets</span>; as we speak of "the violins," meaning <span class= "ital">the players</span> on them. The sacred trumpets or clarions blown on solemn occasions by the priests are intended. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-14.htm" title="But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.">2Kings 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm" title="Make you two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shall you make them: that you may use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.">Numbers 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm" title="And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.">1Chronicles 15:24</a>.) This is an indication that the priests and Levites were present as the chronicle so conspicuously represents, and as, indeed, was to be expected on an occasion when the high priest took the lead, and when the scene of action was the Temple. The acting classes of priests and Levitical musicians, warders, and priestly attendants must certainly have participated in the proceedings.<p><span class= "bld">All the people of the land.</span>--Secrecy was no longer necessary, as Thenius supposes, when once the centurions of the guard had heartily taken up with the plot.<p><span class= "bld">Rejoiced . . . blew.</span>--<span class= "ital">Rejoicing . . . blowing.</span><p><span class= "bld">Treason.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Conspiracy</span>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar</span>; rather, <span class="accented">on the pillar</span>, or on <span class="accented">the raised platform</span>.

Some rumor of what was about to occur had got abroad, and many of the people had provided themselves with trumpets. As Dean Stanley puts it, "The temple court was crowded with spectators, and they too took part in the celebration, and themselves prolonged the trumpet-blast, blended with the musical instruments of the temple service." <span class="cmt_word">And Athaliah rent her clothes.</span> Athaliah took in all with a single glance. She "saw that the fatal hour was come" (Stanley).
