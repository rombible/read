The narrative woke another chord of memory which had hitherto slept. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, This is the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite.</span> The prophecy referred to is doubtless that recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>. It is, however, here expanded, either because Jehu's recollection was not exact, or because the record in 1 Kings is abbreviated. The great point of the prophecy is common to both records, viz. that the dogs should eat Jezebel at Jezreel, on the scene of her iniquities. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel.</span> It is not quite clear what is meant by the portion (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span>) of Jezreel. Probably there is no allusion to the "portion" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) of Naboth (vers. 25, 26). Rather the same is meant as by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>, viz. the cultivated space or "portion" of land outside the wall of the town (see the comment on that passage). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:30-37 Instead of hiding herself, as one afraid of Divine vengeance, Jezebel mocked at fear. See how a heart, hardened against God, will brave it out to the last. There is not a surer presage of ruin, than an unhumbled heart under humbling providences. Let those look at Jezebel's conduct and fate, who use arts to seduce others to commit wickedness, and to draw them aside from the ways of truth and righteousness. Jehu called for aid against Jezebel. When reformation-work is on foot, it is time to ask, Who sides with it? Her attendants delivered her up. Thus she was put to death. See the end of pride and cruelty, and say, The Lord is righteous. When we pamper our bodies, let us think how vile they are; shortly they will be a feast for worms under ground, or beasts above ground. May we all flee from that wrath which is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.</body></html>
