Nothing is known of Jehu's origin. He is twice mentioned by Shalmaneser II., king of Assyria, as one of his tributaries. In a fragment of his Annals relating to the campaign against Hazael, undertaken in his eighteenth year (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.">2Kings 8:15</a>), the Assyrian monarch states that, after besieging Damascus, and ravaging the Hauran, he marched to the mountains of Baal-<span class= "ital">rosh</span>, the foreland of the sea (Carmel?), and set up his royal image thereon. "In that day the tribute of the land of the Tyrians (and) Sidonians, (and) of Ya'ua (Jehu), son of Omri, I received." On the Black Obelisk there is a representation of Jehu's tribute-bearers, and, perhaps, of Jehu himself, kneeling before Shalmaneser. The superscription is: "Tribute of Ya'ua, son of Humri (Omri)--(ingots of) silver and gold, a bowl of gold, ewers of gold, goblets of gold, buckets of gold, (ingots of) lead, a rod of the hand of the king, spears--I received it."<p><span class= "bld">Go in.</span>--Into Jehu's house.<p><span class= "bld">From among his brethren</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, his comrades in arms; his fellow-captains.<p><span class= "bld">Carry him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">cause him to enter</span>.

Elijah had been bidden to anoint him king, but apparently had neglected to do so, or rather had devolved the task upon his successor. Meantime Jehu served as a soldier under Ahaziah and Jehoram, Ahab's sons, and attained such distinction that he became one of the captains of the host (<span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 5), according to Josephus (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.) the chief captain. Jehu was commonly known as "the son of Nimshi" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-20.htm">2 Kings 9:20</a>), either because, his father having died young, he was brought up by his grandfather, or perhaps simply "because Nimshi was a person of more importance than Jehoshaphat." <span class="cmt_word">And go in</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, seek his presence, go into his quarters, wherever they may be, have direct speech with him - <span class="cmt_word">and make him arise up from among his brethren</span> (comp. vers. 5 and 6). Jehu's "brethren" are his <span class="accented">brother-officers</span>, among whom Elisha knows that he will be found sitting. <span class="cmt_word">And carry him to an inner chamber.</span> Persuade him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to quit the place where thou wilt find him sitting with the other generals, and to go with thee into a private apartment for secret conference. Secrecy was of extreme importance, lest Joram should get knowledge of what was happening, and prepare himself for resistance. Had he not been taken by surprise, the result might have been a long and bloody civil war. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 In these and the like events, we must acknowledge the secret working of God, disposing men to fulfil his purposes respecting them. Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.</body></html>
