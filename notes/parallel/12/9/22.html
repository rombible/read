Jehu's reply left no doubt of his intentions. He assumes the part of champion of the legitimate worship against Jezebel and her foreign innovations, and the lawless tyrannies by which she sought to enforce them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25-26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">What peace . . . are so many?</span>--<span class= "ital">Rather, What is the peace during the whoredoms of thy mother, and her many witchcrafts--i.e., so long as they continue?</span><p><span class= "bld">Whoredoms.</span>--In the spiritual sense, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, idolatries.

(Comp. the prohibitions in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm" title="You shall not suffer a witch to live.">Exodus 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/18-10.htm" title="There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.">Deuteronomy 18:10-11</a>.) A great number of the Assyrian tablets contain magical formulas, incantations, and exorcisms. Babylonia was the home of the pseudo-science of magic; and the oldest collection of such formulas is that of Sargina king of Agade (Accad), compiled in seventy tablets, about 2200 B.C.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu?</span> Still the same question is asked; but we cannot be sure that it is asked in exactly the same sense. Something in the aspect of Jehu, and in his furious haste, may by this time have alarmed the king. Or possibly he maybe merely repeating the question put through his messengers, and still unanswered, Is all well with the army or no? Has there been any disaster?" Jehu, at any rate, chooses to understand his vague phrase in the former sense, as if he had asked, "Is it peace between thee and me?" and answers in the negative. <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witch-crafts are so many?</span> literally, <span class="accented">so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and those many witchcrafts of hers continue</span>. By "whoredoms" are meant idolatries, as so frequently in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-5.htm">Leviticus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-11.htm">Ezekiel 23:11</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a>, etc.); by "witchcrafts" all those magical practices which were so common at the time in Egypt, Assyria, and Babylonia, and no doubt also in Phoenicia, and which were so strictly forbidden by the Mosaic Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). Besides the Baal-worship, Jezebel had introduced these unhallowed practices into the kingdom of Israel. Jehu reproaches Joram with allowing them, and declares that there can be no peace between him and his master under ouch circumstances. Having gained his object and got within bowshot of the unsuspecting monarch, he throws off the mask and declares uncompromising hostility. "No man could use such terms of the queen-mother who was willing any longer to be a subject." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:16-29 Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.</body></html>
