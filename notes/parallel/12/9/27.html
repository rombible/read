So the Syriac: "Him also! slay him! and they slew him in his chariot, on the ascent of Gur," &c. But the rendering of the LXX. involves the least change, and is probably right: "Him too! And he smote him in the chariot, in the going up," &c. This is more graphic. Jehu simply ejaculates," Him too! "and, after a hot pursuit, shoots his second victim, at the ascent or declivity of Gur, where Ahaziah's chariot would be forced to slacken speed.<p>The ascent of Gur is not mentioned elsewhere. Ibleam lay between Jezreel and Megiddo. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-27.htm" title="Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.">Judges 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm" title="And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.">Joshua 17:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</span>--See the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.">2Chronicles 22:9</a>, where a different tradition respecting the end of Ahaziah is recorded. The definite assignment of localities in the present account is a mark of greater trustworthiness. The way in which Rashi, whom Keil follows, attempts to combine the two accounts, is revolting to common sense. It would be better to assume a corruption of the text in one or the other narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Megiddo.</span>--Identified in the cuneiform inscriptions as <span class= "ital">Magid- or Magad-</span>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-29.</span> <span class="accented">- Murder of Ahaziah</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house.</span> As soon as Ahaziah saw Jehu shoot his arrow, he too took to flight; not, however, in the same direction as Joram, but southwards, towards his own land. If "garden house" is the right translation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, we can say no more than that it was probably one of the lodges of the royal demesne, which lay south-east and south of Jezreel, whereof nothing more is known. But it is quite possible that we ought to translate, with the LXX., "by the way of Beth-Gan" - <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x28;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>. In this case "Beth-Gan" would be a village or town, probably identical with En-gannim, which lay at the foot of the hills bounding the Plain of Esdraelon, nearly due south of Jezreel (Zerin), and which is now known as Jenin (see the Map of Western Palestine, by Mr. Trelawney Saunders, compiled from the surveys of the Palestine Exploration Fund, where Ahaziah's flight is well traced. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu followed after him; and said, Smite him also in the chariot</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in his chariot</span>, not in that of Jehoram, since the two kings rode respectively in their own chariots (ver. 21). It was a bold step in a pretender not yet settled upon the throne to provoke the hostility of a neighboring country by murdering its monarch; but Jehu probably thought he had more to fear from Ahaziah himself, who had been on such close terms of friendship with Jehoram, than from any probable successors. He, therefore, finding him in his power, pursued after him and slew him. From a religious point of view he could justify the act; since the commission given to him (ver. 7) was to smite all the house of Ahab, and Ahaziah was Ahab's grandson. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. The "ascent of Gur," <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5be;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, was probably the rising ground between the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraslon and the place known as" Ibleam," or "Bileam" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>), which is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Bir-el-Belameh</span>, two miles south of Jenin. Here the steep ascent necessarily delayed the chariot, and Ahaziah's pursuers gained upon him, approached him, and wounded him. <span class="cmt_word">And he fled to Megiddo.</span> Wounded at the ascent of Gur, and despairing of making his way through the rough mountainous country which lay between him and Jerusalem, Ahaziah suddenly changed his route, perhaps thereby baffling his pursuers, and, skirting the hills, had himself conveyed to Megiddo (Ledjun), where he died, either of his wounds, or through some fresh violence on the part of Jehu (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-8.htm">2 Chronicles 12:8, 9</a>). The reconciliation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-8.htm">2 Chronicles 12:8, 9</a> with the present passage is difficult, but not wholly impossible. Perhaps the Chronicler means by "Samaria" the kingdom, not the town. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:16-29 Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.</body></html>
