(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.">1Kings 21:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joram said, Make ready</span> - rather, <span class="accented">harness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">attach - i.e.</span> "attach the horses to the chariot - <span class="cmt_word">and his chariot was made ready</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and one attached</span>, <span class="accented">or harnessed</span>, <span class="accented">his chariot - <span class="cmt_word"></span>and Joram King of Israel and Ahaziah King of Judah went out, each in his chariot.</span> The uncle and the nephew went out together, still, as it would seem, unapprehensive of any danger, though the circumstances were certainly such as might well have amused suspicion. Joram was probably anxious to know the reasons which had induced the captain of his host to quit his post at Ramoth-Gilead. Ahaziah probably accompanied him out of politeness, though he too may have been curious to learn the news. If any disaster had overtaken the army of Israel, the safety of Judah might also be endangered. "Tun res agitur, paries cum proximus ardet." <span class="cmt_word">And they went out against Jehu</span> - rather, <span class="accented">to meet Jehu -</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;</span> (LXX.); see the Revised Version - <span class="cmt_word">and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> Humanly speaking, this was accidental. The "portion of Naboth," or his plot of ground, lay outside the southeastern gate of the city, at no great distance from the walls; and it happened that Joram and Jehu met within its limits. Had the king started a little sooner, or had Jehu made less haste, the meeting would have taken place further from the town, and outside the "portion of Naboth." But Divine providence so ordered matters that vengeance for the sin of Ahab was exacted upon the very scene of his guilt, and a prophecy made, probably by Elisha, years previously, and treasured up in the memory of Jehu (ver. 26), was fulfilled to the letter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:16-29 Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.</body></html>
