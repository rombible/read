Jehu was accompanied, therefore, by a considerable force.<p><span class= "bld">Joram said.</span>--Not to the watchman, but to one of his courtiers. The narrative is very concise.<p><span class= "bld">Is it peace?</span>--This hardly represents the force of the original. Joram is not yet apprehensive. His question merely means, "What is the news?" He expects news from the army at Ramoth. Thenius, however, explains "Come ye with friendly or hostile intention?" In that case, would the king have sent <span class= "ital">a single horseman</span> to ascertain the truth?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and the watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel</span>. The watchtower on the southeast, towards Ramoth-Gilead, is intended. There were probably others in other directions; but the writer is not concerned with them. Each watchtower had its one watchman, who gave warning if anything unusual caught his attention. <span class="cmt_word">And he spied the company of Jehu as he came.</span> <span class="accented">Shiph'ah</span> is generally "abundance," "multitude" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-11.htm">Job 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>), but seems here to designate a "baud ' or "company" of moderate size. It is a somewhat rare word. <span class="cmt_word">And said, I see a company.</span> The watchman gave notice to those whose business it was to inform the king, that a band or company of men was approaching the city. <span class="cmt_word">And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</span> Joram apprehended no danger. If the "company" had been a band of Syrians, or other enemies, coming in hostile fashion, the watchman would have worded his warning differently. The king probably concluded that he was about to receive tidings from the seat of war, and meant to ask, "Is the news good or bad - peaceful or the contrary?" No blame attaches to him for not taking alarm at once. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:16-29 Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.</body></html>
