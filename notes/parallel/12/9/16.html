And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.">2Kings 8:29</a>. After relating what had meanwhile occurred with the army at Ramoth, the narrative returns to that point. Instead of <span class= "ital">Joram was lying there</span>, the LXX. has, "Joram king of Israel was being healed in Jezreel of the shots wherewith the Arameans shot him in Ramoth, in the war with Hazael king of Syria, because he was mighty and a man of might." The first sentence, "Joram king of Israel . . . king of Syria," was probably a marginal note of a different reading of the first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-15.htm" title="But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.">2Kings 9:15</a>. This was inadvertently inserted by some transcriber in connection with <span class= "ital">Joram</span> in the present verse. The sentence, "Because he was mighty and a man of might," was originally a marginal note on the words "Hazael king of Syria" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm" title="So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.">2Kings 9:14</a>), but in like manner came to be erroneously connected with the same words in the various reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-15.htm" title="But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.">2Kings 9:15</a> (<span class= "ital">Thenius</span>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.</span> We must understand that the captains came into Jehu's views, acknowledged the necessity of secrecy, and took precautions against the departure of any one, openly or secretly, from the city. Jehu, with a moderate troop or company (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), sets out, perhaps on the very day of his enthronement, and hastens with all speed to Jezreel, bent on arriving there before any suspicion has arisen of revolt or rebellion. His great object was to surprise Joram, and to kill or capture him before he could take any steps to organize a defense. Probably the force which accompanied him was wholly a chariot force. <span class="cmt_word">And Ahaziah King of Judah was come down to see Joram</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a>, and the comment A.D. loc). Ahaziah, it must be remembered, was Joram's nephew, as well as his ally in the war against Syria. It was natural that he should visit his uncle when he was wounded, even if the wounds were not very serious. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:16-29 Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.</body></html>
