a formula of emphatic asseveration, which originally must have run somewhat as follows: "If I have not seen, may I perish." The inappropriateness of such an expression in the mouth of the Deity is obvious; but that only shows how completely the original meaning of the formula was forgotten in everyday usage.<p><span class= "bld">Yesterday.</span>--So that Ahab seized the vineyard the day after the murder of Naboth, a detail not exactly specified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.">1Kings 21:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The blood.</span>--The plural (margin) implies <span class= "ital">death by violence</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm" title="And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.">Genesis 4:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the blood of his sons.</span>--The murder of the sons of Naboth is neither stated nor implied in 1 Kings 21, an omission which has needlessly troubled the minds of commentators. As to the fact, it would be quite in accordance with ancient practice to slay the sons of one accused of blasphemy along with their father (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/7-24.htm" title="And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.">Joshua 7:24-25</a>); and the crafty Jezebel would not be likely to spare persons whose wrongs might one day prove dangerous. The difference in the two narratives is accounted for by the circumstance that the present is the <span class= "ital">exact version</span> of an eye-witness, viz., Jehu himself, while the former was probably derived from a less direct source.<p><span class= "bld">Saith the Lord.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">is the thing uttered of Jehovah.</span> This phrase, which is uncommon except in the writings of the prophets, and the word rendered "burden" in the last verse, which also belongs to prophetic terminology, together establish the historical authenticity of the short oracle of Elijah, recorded in this verse. Its brevity and the solemnity with which it was pronounced would, we may be sure, stamp it ineffaceably upon the memory of those who heard it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm" title="Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.">1Samuel 2:30</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-33.htm" title="By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, said the LORD.">2Kings 19:33</a>, <span class= "ital">infra</span>.)<p><span class= "bld">I will requite thee in this plat.</span>--Another important detail not given in the former account.<p><span class= "bld">Plat.</span>--<span class= "ital">Portion,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25</a> (twice).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>, where the same idea of retribution is expressed, though in different words). Jehu, after the lapse of fourteen or fifteen years, naturally had forgotten the exact words used. <span class="cmt_word">And the blood of his sons.</span> The execution of Naboth's sons had not been mentioned previously; but, under the rude jurisprudence of the age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>), sons were usually slain with their fathers. And, unless they had been removed, Ahab could not have inherited the vineyard. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord.</span> This was the gist of the prophecy, which ran as follows: "In <span class="accented">the place</span> where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine." <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the Lord.</span> The evil prophesied against Ahab had been formally and expressly deferred to his son's days on Ahab's repentance (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:16-29 Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.</body></html>
