But king Joram was returned.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Now Joram had been on guard in Ramoth-gilead</span> . . . <span class= "ital">And Jehoram the king returned</span>. The whole is a parenthesis intended to explain Jehu's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-15.htm" title="But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.">2Kings 9:15</a> : "Let none go forth . . . to <span class= "ital">tell it in Jezreel.</span>" Although substantially a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/8-28.htm" title="And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.">2Kings 8:28-29</a>, it was hardly "superfluous" (<span class= "ital">Thenius</span>) to remind the reader at this point of Joram's absence--a material element in the success of the conspiracy. Graf's conjecture that <span class= "ital">Jehu</span> should be read instead of <span class= "ital">Joram</span> is an obvious one, but hardly correct.<p><span class= "bld">Because of Hazael.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">against Hazael</span>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi</span> (see the comment on ver. 2) <span class="cmt_word">conspired against Joram.</span> It is not meant that there was a secret conspiracy previous to the prophet's coming, but that, by the open acts which followed on his coming, Jehu and the captains were guilty of a "conspiracy." <span class="cmt_word">Now Joram had kept Ra-moth-Gilead</span>; rather, <span class="accented">now Joram was keeping Ramoth-Gilead</span>. Joram, in his capacity of chief ruler, was keeping, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> defending, Ramoth-Gilead against the Syrians with the bulk of his forces. <span class="cmt_word">He and all Israel, because of Hazael King of Syria</span>; since Hazael wished to win the city back, and would have done so, had it not been stoutly defended. The writer speaks of Joram as the defender, though he was absent, because the defense was made under his orders. Then, to lore-vent misunderstanding, he repeats what he had already said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a> with respect to Joram's wounds, and his retirement to Jezreel to be healed of them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-15 Those who faithfully deliver the Lord's message to sinners, have in all ages been treated as madmen. Their judgment, speech, and conduct are contrary to those of other men; they endure much in pursuit of objects, and are influenced by motives, into which the others cannot enter. But above all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of all sorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of the devoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable. Some faith in the word of God, seems to have animated Jehu to this undertaking.</body></html>
