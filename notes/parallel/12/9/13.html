The words are much discussed by commentators. The LXX. has, "and put it underneath him on the <span class= "ital">garem</span> of the steps" (retaining the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">gerem</span>); the Syriac, "and put it under him on a seat of steps;" the Targum, "at the steps of the hours," i.e., a flight of steps which served as a sundial (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-11.htm" title="And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.">2Kings 20:11</a>); the Vulg., "and each one, taking his cloak, put it under his feet <span class= "ital">in similitudinem tribunalis</span>," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in the fashion of a rostrum, or elevated platform; the Arabic, "on the steps of the rise" (or "elevation").<p>The word <span class= "ital">gerem</span>, rendered "top," can hardly have that meaning. In Hebrew it rarely occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-22.htm" title="A merry heart does good like a medicine: but a broken spirit dries the bones.">Proverbs 17:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-15.htm" title="By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.">Proverbs 25:15</a>), and means <span class= "ital">bone</span>, for which in Aramaic it is the usual term (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-25.htm" title="Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.">Daniel 6:25</a>). In Arabic the word means "body," and it is usually so explained in one passage of the Bible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-14.htm" title="Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:">Genesis 49:14</a>), "Issachar is a strong ass;" literally, <span class= "ital">an ass of body</span>. As the Aramaic <span class= "ital">garma</span> is used in the sense of "self," some would render the present phrase, "on the stairs themselves." But perhaps we may better translate on the analogy of the Arabic word, "They put (their cloaks) under him, on to ('el) the body of the stairs." The stairway on the outside of the house, leading to the roof, served as an extemporised throne, or rather platform, for the king. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-14.htm" title="And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.">2Kings 11:14</a>.) Some Hebrew MSS. have "upon" for "on to." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm" title="And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped on them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.">2Samuel 21:10</a>, "on the rock.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs.</span> Kings were honored by the spreading of garments in their way, that their feet might not touch the dusty ground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-8.htm">Matthew 20:8</a>). The captains of the host, without hesitation, acclaimed Jehu king on the strength of the prophetical announcement, made his cause their own, and joined in his rebellion. It is reasonably conjectured (Bahr) that "a deep dissatisfaction with Joram must have prevailed in the <span class="accented">army</span>," though whether the dissatisfaction arose from the idolatry of the house of Ahab, or from Joram's withdrawal from the war, may be doubted, Jehu, on the ether hand, was evidently highly esteemed. The captains threw themselves with ardor into his cause, and extemporized a sort of enthronement. As often in an Oriental house, an external staircase led from the court to the upper story or to the roof. This they carpeted with their <span class="accented">begeds</span>, or outer cloaks, and, seating him on the top stair, saluted him as actual king. The expression, <span class="accented">el-gerem ham-ma'aloth</span>, is not literally, "on the <span class="accented">top</span> of the stairs," but rather "on the stairs <span class="accented">themselves</span>." Naturally, however, the captains would emplace him upon the topmost stair. <span class="cmt_word">And blew with trumpets.</span> This was a recognized part of the ceremonial of a coronation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Jehu is king.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-15 Those who faithfully deliver the Lord's message to sinners, have in all ages been treated as madmen. Their judgment, speech, and conduct are contrary to those of other men; they endure much in pursuit of objects, and are influenced by motives, into which the others cannot enter. But above all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of all sorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of the devoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable. Some faith in the word of God, seems to have animated Jehu to this undertaking.</body></html>
