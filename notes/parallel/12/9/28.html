As soon, therefore, as Ahaziah was dead, his attendants conveyed his dead body in a chariot to the Judaean capital.

Jewish, like Egyptian, kings seem to have made it their business to see to the construction of their tomb as soon as they mounted the throne. Thus Ahaziah, though he had reigned but a year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>), had already prepared, himself, a sepulcher. His "servants" buried him in it. <span class="cmt_word">With his fathers in the city of David</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; 14:37; 15:8, 24; 22:50; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-24.htm">2 Kings 8:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:16-29 Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.</body></html>
