(comp. vers. 17,18, 19, 22) - or, in other words, u Is all right?" "Is all well?" The sudden appearance and disappearance of the messenger had evidently created an impression that all was not well. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?</span> He did not suppose the man to be actually mad. He calls him "this wild fellow" - "this scatterbrain," on account of the haste and strangeness of his conduct; but he quite expects to hear that there was "method in the <span class="accented">madness</span>," and that the communication had some serious import. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehu - <span class="cmt_word">said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</span> Jehu suspected that the whole scene had been arranged beforehand; that Elisha and the young prophet and the captains of the host were in league, and had concerted a way of offering him the throne. He may have had reason to regard the captains as disaffected towards Jehoram, though this does not appear at all distinctly in the very brief narrative. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-15 Those who faithfully deliver the Lord's message to sinners, have in all ages been treated as madmen. Their judgment, speech, and conduct are contrary to those of other men; they endure much in pursuit of objects, and are influenced by motives, into which the others cannot enter. But above all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of all sorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of the devoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable. Some faith in the word of God, seems to have animated Jehu to this undertaking.</body></html>
