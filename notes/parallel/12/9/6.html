Reuss asserts that this account of the anointing of Jehu, like that of the anointing of Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-13.htm" title="And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that you shall be king over Syria.">2Kings 8:13</a>), is substituted in the present narration for what another document related of <span class= "ital">Elijah</span>. This is pure conjecture. It is easier to suppose that Elijah had instructed his successor to carry out the commission intrusted to himself, although the narrative nowhere says so. He goes on to remark that there is no need to try to clear Elisha of the charge of being a revolutionary and a regicide, for that the new dynasty would make use of his name by way of legitimising itself, exactly as the houses of Kish and of Jesse made use of that of the prophet Samuel. This is being considerably wiser than our only authorities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he (Jehu) arose, and went into the house.</span> Jehu left his seat, rose up, and led the way, from the court, where he had probably been sitting with the other generals, into the house which adjoined the court. The messenger followed; and the two were together, alone. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the messenger - <span class="cmt_word">poured the oil on his head</span> - as directed (ver. 3) - <span class="cmt_word">and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel</span>; literally, Thus <span class="accented">saith Jehovah</span>, <span class="accented">God of Israel</span>. Jehovah's name is emphatically put forward, in contrast with the name of Baal, as that of the true God of Israel; and appeal is made to Jehu, as to one whose God is Jehovah, and who will accept as authoritative a message emanating from him. I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel; literally, <span class="accented">over the people of Jehovah</span>, <span class="accented">over Israel</span>. Practically, the people is, in the main, "the people of Baal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-19.htm">2 Kings 10:19-21</a>), but theoretically and by covenant it is "the people of Jehovah" - his "peculiar people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>), chosen by him out of all the nations of the earth to be his own. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 In these and the like events, we must acknowledge the secret working of God, disposing men to fulfil his purposes respecting them. Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.</body></html>
