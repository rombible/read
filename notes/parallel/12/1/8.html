This might refer to length of hair and beard (so LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, "hirsute," "shaggy"); or to a hairy cloak or mantle. The second alternative is right, because a hairy mantle was a mark of the prophetic office from Elijah downwards. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he has prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:">Zechariah 13:4</a>, "a rough garment;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>, where it is said of John Baptist--the second Elias--that "he was clad in camel's hair," and had "a leather girdle about his loins.") The girdle, as Thenius remarks, would not be mentioned alone. The common dress of the Bedawis is a sheep or goat's skin with the hair left on.<p><span class= "bld">Girt with a girdle of leather.</span>--Such as only the poorest would wear. The girdle was ordinarily of linen or cotton, and often costly. The prophet's dress was a sign of contempt for earthly display, and of sorrow for the national sins and their consequences, which it was his function to proclaim. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A hairy man</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">lord</span> <span class="accented">of hair</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>). Some take the meaning to be that he was rough and unkempt, with his hair and beard long; and so the LXX., who give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>. But the more usual explanation is that he wore a shaggy coat of untanned skin, with the hair outward. Such a garment seems certainly to have been worn by the later prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and to have been regarded as a sign of their profession. But there is no positive evidence that the dress had been adopted by Isaiah's time. <span class="cmt_word">Girt with a girdle of leather.</span> Generally the Israelites wore girdles of a soft material, as linen or cotton. The "curious girdle" of the high priest's ephod was of "fine twined linen," embroidered with gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-8.htm">Exodus 28:8</a>). Girdles of leather, rough and uncomfortable, would only be worn by the very poor and by the ascetic. Elijah may have adopted his rough and coarse costume, either to show contempt for things earthly, as Hengstenberg thinks; or as a penitential garb indicating sorrow for the sins of the people, as Keil supposes; or simple to chastise and subdue the flesh, as other ascetics. <span class="cmt_word">It is Elijah the Tishbite.</span> The description given is enough. The king has no longer any doubt. His suspicion is turned into certainty. There is no living person but Elijah who would at once have the boldness to prophesy the death of the king, and would wear such a costume as described. Elijah is, of course, his enemy, as he had been his father's "enemy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>), and will wish him ill, and prophesy accordingly, the wish being "father to the thought." It is not improbable that Elijah had withdrawn himself into obscurity on the accession of Ahaziah, or at any rate on his exhibition of strong idolatrous proclivities (Ewald), as he had done on more than one occasion from Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8-8</a>). Ahaziah may have been long wishing to arrest and imprison him, and now thought he saw his opportunity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 When Ahaziah rebelled against the Lord, Moab revolted from him. Sin weakens and impoverishes us. Man's revolt from God is often punished by the rebellion of those who owe subjection to him. Ahaziah fell through a lattice, or railing. Wherever we go, there is but a step between us and death. A man's house is his castle, but not to secure him against God's judgments. The whole creation, which groans under the burden of man's sin, will, at length, sink and break under the weight like this lattice. He is never safe that has God for his enemy. Those that will not inquire of the word of God for their comfort, shall hear it to their terror, whether they will or no.</body></html>
