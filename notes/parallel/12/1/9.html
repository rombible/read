The true God was thus insulted in the person of His prophet.<p><span class= "bld">Come down.</span>--Or, Pray come down--in a tone of ironical politeness (<span class= "ital">r?d?h</span>? precative).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king sent unto him a captain of fifty.</span> "Captains of fifties" were first instituted in the wilderness by the advice of Jethro (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-25</a>). Though not expressly mentioned in the military organization of David, they probably formed a part of it, and so passed into the institutions of the kingdom of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">With his fifty.</span> Some recognition of Elijah's superhuman power would seem to have led Ahaziah to send so large a body. His doing so was a sort of challenge to the prophet to show whether Ahaziah or the God whom he represented was the stronger. The circumstances recall those of the "band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>), which was sent, "with swords and staves," to arrest another righteous Person. <span class="cmt_word">He sat on the top of a hill</span>; literally, on <span class="accented">the top of the hill</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). The high ground where Elijah had met the messengers (ver. 3) seems to be intended. When they were gone, the prophet took his seat on the highest point, conspicuous on all sides, so avoiding any attempt at concealment, and awaiting the next step that the king would take, calmly and quietly. <span class="cmt_word">He spake unto him; Thou man of God.</span> The captain is thought by some to have spoken ironically; but there is no evidence of this. The address is respectful, submissive. The miraculous powers of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) were probably known to the officer, who hoped by the tone of his address to escape the prophet's anger. In the same spirit he avoids issuing any command of his own, and prefers simply to deliver the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">The king hath said, Come down.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-18 Elijah called for fire from heaven, to consume the haughty, daring sinners; not to secure himself, but to prove his mission, and to reveal the wrath of God from heaven, against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. Elijah did this by a Divine impulse, yet our Saviour would not allow the disciples to do the like, Lu 9:54. The dispensation of the Spirit and of grace by no means allowed it. Elijah was concerned for God's glory, those for their own reputation. The Lord judges men's practices by their principles, and his judgment is according to truth. The third captain humbled himself, and cast himself upon the mercy of God and Elijah. There is nothing to be got by contending with God; and those are wise for themselves, who learn submission from the fatal end of obstinacy in others. The courage of faith has often struck terror into the heart of the proudest sinner. So thunderstruck is Ahaziah with the prophet's words, that neither he, nor any about him, offer him violence. Who can harm those whom God shelters? Many who think to prosper in sin, are called hence like Ahaziah, when they do not expect it. All warns us to seek the Lord while he may be found.</body></html>
