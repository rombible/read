The word rendered "through" (<span class= "ital">b?'ad</span>) implies that Ahaziah was leaning out over the window-sill. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-30.htm" title="And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.">2Kings 9:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-2.htm" title="The LORD looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.">Psalm 14:2</a>.) He perhaps fell into a gallery underneath, as the palace would be several storeys high, and he was not killed by his fall. The word <span class= "ital">s?b?kh?h</span> means "net" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm" title="For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on a snare.">Job 18:8</a>, and decorative "network" in metal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-18.htm" title="And he made the pillars, and two rows round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital.">1Kings 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-12.htm" title="To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;">2Chronicles 4:12</a>. The Rabbis explain it here as a sort of skylight to the chamber beneath the upper chamber, or a spiral stairway; both improbable.<p><span class= "bld">He sent messengers</span>.--By Jezebe?s advice.

"Lord of Flies" is generally compared with the Greek <span class= "greekheb">???? ????????</span>,<span class= "ital"> or </span><span class= "greekheb">????????</span>, the "fly-averting Zeus" of the Eleans (Paus., viii. 26, 4), and it is no doubt true that flies are an extraordinary pest in the East. But when we remember that "myiomancy," or divination by watching the movements of flies, is an ancient Babylonian practice, we can hardly doubt that this is the true significance of the title "Baal-zebub." In the Assyrian deluge tablet the gods are said to have gathered over Izdubar's sacrifice "like flies" (<span class= "ital">kima zumbie</span>). The later Jewish spelling (<span class= "greekheb">??????????</span>) probably contains an allusive reference to the Talmudic woras <span class= "ital">zebel</span> ("dung"), <span class= "ital">zibb-l</span> ("dunging").<p><span class= "bld">Ekron.</span>--<span class= "ital">Akir</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm" title="From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:">Joshua 13:3</a>).

It is implied that the <span class="cmt_word">upper chamber</span> had a single window, which was closed by a single <span class="accented">lattice</span>, or shutter of interlaced woodwork. The shutter may have been insufficiently secured; or the woodwork may have been too weak to bear his weight, Compare the fall of Eutychus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>), where, however, there is no mention of a "lattice." <span class="cmt_word">Was sick</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "was so injured that he had to take to his bed." <span class="cmt_word">Inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron.</span> As a worshipper of Baal, bent on walking in the evil way of his father and of his mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>), Ahaziah would naturally inquire of some form of the Baal divinity. Why he chose "Baal-zebub the god of Ekron," it is impossible to say. Perhaps Baal-zebub had at the time a special reputation for giving oracular responses. Perhaps the Ekron temple was, of all the ancient sites of the Baal-worship, the one with which he could most readily communicate. Philistia lay nearer to Samaria than Phoenicia did, and of the Philistine towns Ekron (now <span class="accented">Akir</span>) was the most northern, and so the nearest. "Baal-zebub" has been thought by some to be equivalent to "Beel-samen," "the lord of heaven" - a divine title well known to the Phoenicians; but this view is etymologically unsound, since <span class="accented">zebub</span> cannot possibly mean "heaven." "Baal-zebub" is "the lord of flies " - either the god who sends them as a plague on any nation that offends him (setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21-31</a>), or the god who averts them from his votaries and favorites, an equivalent of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or the Roman "Jupiter Myiagrus," flies being in the East not infrequently a terrible plague.

Sin weakens and impoverishes us. Man's revolt from God is often punished by the rebellion of those who owe subjection to him. Ahaziah fell through a lattice, or railing. Wherever we go, there is but a step between us and death. A man's house is his castle, but not to secure him against God's judgments. The whole creation, which groans under the burden of man's sin, will, at length, sink and break under the weight like this lattice. He is never safe that has God for his enemy. Those that will not inquire of the word of God for their comfort, shall hear it to their terror, whether they will or no.</body></html>
