Thenius argues that the garden of Uzza lay in the Tyrop?on, at the foot of the spur of Ophel. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm" title="And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach on Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.">2Samuel 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-7.htm" title="And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat Uzza, and Ahihud.">1Chronicles 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-49.htm" title="The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai,">Ezra 2:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-51.htm" title="The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah,">Nehemiah 7:51</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house.</span> We have already seen reason for believing that the catacomb of David was full, and that Hezekiah was buried outside it, though in the neighborhood, on this account (see the comment on 2 Kings 20:21). Manasseh seems to have made a new family tomb in a garden belonging to his house (see ver. 26; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>). It is quite impossible to fix its site. <span class="cmt_word">In the garden of Uzza.</span> Probably an addition to the old palace garden; perhaps a purchase made by Manasseh with the object of converting it into a burial-ground. "Uzza," or "Uzzah," was a common name among the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-49.htm">Ezra 2:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-51.htm">Nehemiah 7:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-7.htm">1 Chronicles 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-11</a>), and does not point to any definite individual. <span class="cmt_word">And Amen his son reigned in his stead.</span> "Amon" in Hebrew means "Nursling," or "Darling," and it is quite possible that Manasseh gave his son the name in this sense. But it is also the ordinary Hebrew form of the term ("Amen," or "Amun") by which the Egyptians designated the great god of Thebes, whom the Greeks and Romans called "Ammon." It has therefore been thought by many that it was given by Manasseh to his son "in an idolatrous spirit." So Bishop Cotton in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 61, and others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:10-18 Here is the doom of Judah and Jerusalem. The words used represent the city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken, yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.</body></html>
