Hezekiah's reformation had been carried out against their wishes. They had always leant towards foreign alliances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>) and foreign rites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>).

But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations. In the reformation of large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and in temptation fall away.</body></html>
