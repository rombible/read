The "twelve years" assigned to Amen By the Duke of Manchester ('Times of Daniel') are wholly devoid of foundation, and would throw the entire chronology into confusion. As it is, there is a very exact accordance in this part of the history between the profane and the scriptural dates. <span class="cmt_word">And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</span> Jotbah is probably the same city as the "Jotbath" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-7.htm">Deuteronomy 10:7</a>, and the "Jotbathah" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-33.htm">Numbers 33:33</a>, which was in the neighborhood of Ezion-geber, and therefore probably in the Arabah. Josephus, however, says that Jot-bah was "a city of Judah." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:19-26 Amon profaned God's house with his idols; and God suffered his house to be polluted with his blood. How unrighteous soever they were that did it, God was righteous who suffered it to be done. Now was a happy change from one of the worst, to one of the best of the kings of Judah. Once more Judah was tried with a reformation. Whether the Lord bears long with presumptuous offenders, or speedily cuts them off in their sins, all must perish who persist in refusing to walk in his ways.</body></html>
