<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>); offerings of cakes were made in the very streets to Astarte (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>); the fire of Tophet - a huge furnace in the valley of Hinnom - was kept constantly burning, and the sacrifice of innocent children to the bloody sun-god, Moloch, was perpetual (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a>); it was as common to swear by the name of Moloch as by that of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). Lascivious rites were practiced. Close by the temple the unchaste <span class="accented">priestesses</span> of Venus had their habitations, and their wretched male attendants, the Galli of the classical writers, plied their trade (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>). Cruelty and oppression increased among the upper classes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-1.htm">Zephaniah 3:1-3</a>); the prophets were "light and treacherous persons;" the priests "polluted the sanctuary, and did violence to the Law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1-3</a>). "Spoiling and violence," "strife and contention;" were rife throughout the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>). Ewald sums up the state of things as follows: "The atmosphere of the age was poisoned from above; and the leaders of the people of every class, whose moral decline had already become a subject of lament in the preceding century, sank into an almost incredible degeneracy. The prophets, who ought to have been ever the most loyal guardians of the truth, were for the most part like dumb and greedy dogs; many of the priests allowed themselves to be seduced into offering heathen sacrifices; the judges and nobles paid little heed to the eternal right. Equivocation and hypocrisy spread among those who ought to have ministered most austerely to public truthfulness of life; while those who were engaged in commerce and trade sank into the harshest indifference to every higher aim, and thought only of the acquisition and enjoyment of wealth. So terrible was the demoralization which set in under Manasseh, that those who remained faithful to the ancient religion were either scoffed at as fools, or allowed to perish in cold contempt without any effort being made to save them, and were even derided after their death." <span class="cmt_word">And have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.</span> The moral and spiritual depravity of Judah, though it only came to a head in the time of Manasseh, had its roots in a long-distant past. As St. Stephen pointed out to the Sanhedrin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-39.htm">Acts 7:39-43</a>), it began in the wilderness with the worship of the golden calf, and went on to the worship of the host of heaven, of Moloch, and of Remphan; it was shown markedly in the terrible sin of Peer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>); it stinted God's hand when the nations had to be driven out from Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-5</a>); it provoked God's anger greatly during the whole period of the Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>); checked under David and Solomon, it broke out afresh on the accession of Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>), and showed itself, more or less, under every subsequent king, culminating at last in that fearful condition of things which has been described above (see the comment on the first clause of this verse). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:10-18 Here is the doom of Judah and Jerusalem. The words used represent the city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken, yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.</body></html>
