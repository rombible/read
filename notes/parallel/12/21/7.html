It is meant that the Asherah was erected within the Temple itself, probably in the holy place--an act which was the climax of Manasseh's impiety. (Comp. 23:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-7.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the middle of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places.">Ezekiel 43:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-30.htm" title="For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.">Jeremiah 7:30</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house.</span> He introduced into the temple, and set up there for adoration, an elaborately wrought Asherah, or "sacred tree," probably copied from the elaborate sacred trees of the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 236). These had, in the center, the essential <span class="accented">stele</span>, or pillar, ornamented with rams' horns, symbols of fecundity, and crowned with a representation of a palm tree, the whole being encircled by a framework of metal, twined about it, and throwing out from the circumference, at intervals, either palms or blossoms, or in some instances pomegranates or fir-cones. All the parts represented either animal or vegetable productiveness. <span class="cmt_word">Of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my Name forever.</span> It was the extremest aggravation of Manasseh's wickedness that he was not content to introduce his new religions into the land in other places, but brought them to God's special city which he had chosen, namely, Jerusalem, and there established them, not on the opposite hills, as Solomon had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>), or in a rival temple within the walls, as had been done by Athaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), but within God's holy temple itself. In each of the two courts he placed an idolatrous altar, whereon the people were invited to deposit their offerings; and probably in the temple building itself, perhaps in the very holy of holies, he placed that lust-exciting emblem of Astarte, which was the most horrible profanation of all true religion, turning the truth and grace of God into lasciviousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>). What practical consequences followed on this profanation, we are not distinctly told; but we may readily surmise, especially in the light of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 Young persons generally desire to become their own masters, and to have early possession of riches and power. But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations. In the reformation of large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and in temptation fall away.</body></html>
