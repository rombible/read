The promises of permanence to the city and temple, and of the continued possession of the laud by the people, were, he notes, conditional; and Manasseh, by breaking through the conditions, forfeited them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all that my servant Moses commanded them.</span> The words are not taken from any single passage, but express the general sense of numerous passages, as for example of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-25.htm">Deuteronomy 4:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4-9</a>, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 Young persons generally desire to become their own masters, and to have early possession of riches and power. But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations. In the reformation of large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and in temptation fall away.</body></html>
