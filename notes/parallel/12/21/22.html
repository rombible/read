It is noteworthy that the long reign of Manasseh-Amon is described by the sacred historian simply on the side of its relation to the religion of Israel. The astonishing corruption of worship which broke out during this period; the perverted hankering after foreign rites, which appears to have been only intensified by the restraints endured under Hezekiah; the bloody persecution of those who maintained the ancient faith; the prophetic menaces of coming retribution--such are the main points of the brief but impressive story. As usual, moral and religious license went hand in hand. The prophet Zephaniah denounces all the ruling classes of "the rebellious and polluted city;" princes and judges, prophets and priests, are involved in the same condemnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zephaniah/1-4.htm" title="I will also stretch out my hand on Judah, and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;">Zephaniah 1:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zephaniah/3-1.htm" title="Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!">Zephaniah 3:1-4</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm" title="Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?">Micah 6:10</a> <span class= "ital">seq.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/7-2.htm" title="The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.">Micah 7:2-6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers.</span> Other kings, as Ahaz, had made a sort of compromise between the worship of Jehovah and idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-15</a>).

How unrighteous soever they were that did it, God was righteous who suffered it to be done. Now was a happy change from one of the worst, to one of the best of the kings of Judah. Once more Judah was tried with a reformation. Whether the Lord bears long with presumptuous offenders, or speedily cuts them off in their sins, all must perish who persist in refusing to walk in his ways.</body></html>
