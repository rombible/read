It is possible that Isaiah was still living under Manasseh, and protested in the manner here described against his apostacy. More probably, however, the protests in question were those of that great prophet's disciples: the style is not Isaiah's. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-18.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.">2Chronicles 33:18</a> refers to the history of the kings of Israel for "the words of the seers who spake to Manasseh; "and the originality of the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-13.htm" title="And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.">2Kings 21:13</a> might be held to favour the view that we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/21-11.htm" title="Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols:">2Kings 21:11-15</a>, an extract from that work embodying the authentic oracle of a contemporary prophet.

But it appears much more likely that the passage before us is a sort of <span class= "ital">resume</span> of the substance of many such prophetic addresses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord spake by his servants the prophets, saying.</span> It is uncertain who were the prophets of Manasseh's time. Probably Isaiah was one of them (see ' Introduction to Isaiah,' p. 3.). Habakkuk is thought to have been another (Keil). Nahum and Zephaniah seem also to belong, in part, to his reign. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:10-18 Here is the doom of Judah and Jerusalem. The words used represent the city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken, yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.</body></html>
