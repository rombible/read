(See the Notes on chaps. 16:3, 17:17, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm" title="And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Chronicles 33:6</a>.)<p>"In the time from Manasseh onwards, Moloch-worship and worship of the Queen of Heaven appear as prominent new features of Judah's idolatry.

It was usually the eldest son, who, as the most precious possible offering, was sacrificed to Moloch (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; and, for the true nature of the sacrifice, see the comment on this latter passage). <span class="cmt_word">And observed times.</span> If this translation is right, the reference would be to a superstitious regard for lucky and unlucky days, such as we note in the accounts left of themselves by the Baby-Ionian kings, who begin their buildings "in a happy month, on an auspicious day" (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 487). But probably the true meaning is, "he exercised <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>," or, "had regard to the evil eye," a common superstition in the East. <span class="cmt_word">And used enchantments.</span> A use of spoils is perhaps intended, such as those by which serpents (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) were charmed (see the comment on Isaiah 47:9). <span class="cmt_word">And dealt with familiar spirits and wizards</span> - rather, <span class="accented">he placed in office necromancers</span> (literally, a <span class="accented">necromancer</span>) <span class="accented">and wizards</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gave such persons official positions at his court, instead of putting them to death, as the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>) required - <span class="cmt_word">he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he multiplied to work wickedness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he sought out every possible way; he not only restored all the different kinds of heathen sacrifices and idolatrous customs which had been in use under Ahaz, but carried his opposition to Jehovah a great deal further. As Ewald says ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 208), "He endeavored to become acquainted with all the heathen religions he could find and introduce them into Judah. For this purpose he sent into the most distant lands where there was any famous cultus, and grudged no pains for his one object." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 Young persons generally desire to become their own masters, and to have early possession of riches and power. But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations. In the reformation of large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and in temptation fall away.</body></html>
