The plural is implied by "they told <span class= "ital">them</span>," which immediately follows, and actually occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-11.htm" title="And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.">2Kings 7:11</a>. But the reading of the LXX. and Vulg., "gate," implies the same consonants differently pointed, as those of the word "porter." This attests the antiquity of the reading. Probably, therefore, the word "porter" is here used collectively.<p><span class= "bld">No man . . . voice of man.</span>--The first word (<span class= "ital">'ish</span>) denotes an individual man, the second word (<span class= "ital">'?d?m</span>) denotes the <span class= "ital">species</span>, and so includes women and children.<p><span class= "bld">Horses.</span>--<span class= "ital">The horses</span>. Similarly, <span class= "ital">the asses.</span> Both words are singular (collectives) in the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">Tied</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, tethered and feeding.<p><span class= "bld">The tents.</span>--Omit <span class= "ital">the</span>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they came and called unto the porter of the city</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the guard of the gate nearest them. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, "porter," or "gate-man," is used <span class="accented">collectively<span class="cmt_word"></span>. And they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.</span> The horses and asses within a camp were always "tied," or tethered, as we see from the monumental representations of Egyptian camps (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 476), and also learn from historians (Herod., 4:135). It is somewhat surprising that the horses were left behind, as they would have expedited the flight had they been saddled and mounted. But this was, perhaps, overlooked in the panic. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:3-11 God can, when he pleases, make the stoutest heart to tremble; and as for those who will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shaking of a leaf. Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to report the good tidings to others. From love to him, not from selfish feelings, they will gladly share their earthly good things with their brethren.</body></html>
