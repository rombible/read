Convinced by what they saw that the Syrians had really withdrawn into their own country, they pursued no further, but returned to Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste.</span> Cloaks, shawls, shields, and even swords and spears, would be cast away as <span class="accented">impedimenta - hindrances</span> to a rapid flight. These strewed the line of the retreating army's march. <span class="cmt_word">And the messengers returned, and told the king. Gave a full and complete account of what they had seen.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:12-20 Here see the wants of Israel supplied in a way they little thought of, which should encourage us to depend upon the power and goodness of God in our greatest straits. God's promise may be safely relied on, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned the truth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame his unbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of the plenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, who think that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeply God resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: how uncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God's threatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty. May God help us to inquire whether we are exposed to his threatenings, or interested in his promises.</body></html>
