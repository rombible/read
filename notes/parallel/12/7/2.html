Even granting the very unlikely supposition that Jehovah is about to make windows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm" title="In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.">Genesis 7:11</a>) in the sky, to rain down supplies through them, the promised cheapness of provisions can hardly ensue so soon. Or we may render, "Behold, Jehovah is going to make windows in the sky [<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to pour down provisions upon us]. Can this thing come to pass?" In any case, the tone is that of scoffing unbelief. Reuss renders, with French point, "Voyez donc. Iaheweh en fera pleuvoir! Est ce que c'est chose possible?"<p><span class= "bld">Behold, thou shalt see.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Behold, thou art about </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, destined) <span class= "ital">to see</span>. Elisha partly imitates the speech of the scoffer, which begins in the Hebrew with "Behold, Jehovah is about to make windows." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-26.htm" title="And he said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?">2Kings 5:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lord</span>, or <span class="accented">the captain</span>, as the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> is commonly translated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-9.htm">2 Chronicles 8:9</a>). (For the habit of kings to lean on the hand of an attendant, see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?</span> The king makes no reply; he waits for the result. But the officer on whose arm he leans is not so reticent. Utterly incredulous, he expresses his incredulity in a scoffing way: "Could this possibly be, even if God were to 'make windows in heaven,' as he did at the time of the Flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), and pour through them, instead of rain, as then, a continual shower of fine meal and corn?" Disbelief is expressed, not only in the prophetic veracity of Elisha, but in the power of God. Hence Elisha's stern reply. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</span> At once a threat and a warning. If the thing was to be, and the lord to see it and yet not profit by it, the only reasonable conclusion was that his death was imminent. He was thus warned, and given time to "set his house in order," and to repent and make his peace with the Almighty. Whether he took advantage of the warning, or even understood it, we are not told. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1,2 Man's extremity is God's opportunity of making his own power to be glorious: his time to appear for his people is when their strength is gone. Unbelief is a sin by which men greatly dishonour and displease God, and deprive themselves of the favours he designed for them. Such will be the portion of those that believe not the promise of eternal life; they shall see it at a distance, but shall never taste of it. But no temporal deliverances and mercies will in the end profit sinners, unless they are led to repentance by the goodness of God.</body></html>
