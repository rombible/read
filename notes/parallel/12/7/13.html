(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.">2Kings 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-41.htm" title="But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.">2Kings 4:41</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Five.</span>--Used as an indefinite <span class= "ital">small</span> number, like our "half a dozen." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-8.htm" title="And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.">Leviticus 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-17.htm" title="One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall you flee: till you be left as a beacon on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.">Isaiah 30:17</a>.) The <span class= "ital">actual</span> number taken was two pairs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-14.htm" title="They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.">2Kings 7:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The horses that remain, which are left in the city.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the remaining horses that remain in it</span>. The repetition dwells pathetically on the fewness of those that survive. Instead of "in it," the LXX. and Arabic read "here," which may be right, as the two Hebrew terms closely resemble each other.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, they are as all . . . consumed.</span>--The king's adviser supposes two contingencies: the horses (and their drivers) may return safe, in which case they share the fortune of "all the multitude of Israel that are left" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, have survived the famine, but are likely to die of it); or they may be taken and slain by the enemy, in which case they will be "even as all the multitude that are consumed" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, by the famine and fighting). The sense is thus the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-4.htm" title="If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.">2Kings 7:4</a>. The servant is not much more sanguine than the king: he says, "They have to perish in any case; whether here by famine, or there by the sword, makes little difference." "However it may turn out, nothing worse can happen to the men we send out than has already happened to many others, or than will yet happen to the rest." But perhaps Reuss is right in seeing here simply a reference to the wretched condition of the horses. "Qu'attendre de chevaux qui sont extenues de faim?" A natural doubt whether the starving animals are adequate to the service required of them. "Consumed," then, means <span class= "ital">spent, exhausted.</span><p><span class= "bld">The multitude of Israel.</span>--The article with the first word in the Hebrew is the error of a transcriber, who, as often occurs, wrote the same letter twice.<p><span class= "bld">The Israelites.</span>--<span class= "ital">Israel</span>. Syriac: "Let them bring five of the horsemen who are left: if they are taken, they are accounted of as all the people of Israel who have perished; and let us send and see."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain.</span> One of Jehoram's "servants," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the officers attached to his person, suggested that a small body of horse (four or five) should be sent out to reconnoiter. The besieged had still some horses left, though apparently not many. Note the phrase, "five of the horses <span class="accented">that remain</span>." The majority had died of want, or been killed to furnish food to the garrison. (<span class="cmt_word">Behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in <span class="accented">it</span> - i.e.</span> in Samaria - <span class="cmt_word">behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they will run no more risk than the other troops who remain in the city, for these, too, "are consumed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are on the point of perishing. Supposing that they fall into the enemy's hands, it will go no harder with them than with the "multitude" which is on the point of starvation. <span class="cmt_word">And let us send and see.</span> We can do nothing until we know whether the siege is really raised, or whether the pretended withdrawal is a mere <span class="accented">ruse</span>. We must send and have this matter made clear. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:12-20 Here see the wants of Israel supplied in a way they little thought of, which should encourage us to depend upon the power and goodness of God in our greatest straits. God's promise may be safely relied on, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned the truth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame his unbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of the plenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, who think that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeply God resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: how uncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God's threatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty. May God help us to inquire whether we are exposed to his threatenings, or interested in his promises.</body></html>
