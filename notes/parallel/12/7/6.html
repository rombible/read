The word <span class= "ital">qol</span> (literally, "voice") is commonly used of thunder. (Comp. Psalms 29, <span class= "ital">passim</span>.)

The tract of north Syria between the Euphrates and the Orontes was the cradle of the Hittite race, and it was over this that these kings of the several tribes bore sway. In the thirteenth century (B.C. ) their power extended over great part of Asia Minor, as rock inscriptions prove. Carchemish, Kadesh, Hamath, and Helbon (<span class= "ital">Aleppo</span>) were their capitals. Rameses II. made a treaty of peace with <span class= "ital">Heta-sira</span>, the prince of the Hittites. In the time of Tiglath Pileser I. (B.C. 1120), the Hittites were still paramount from the Euphrates to the Lebanon. Shalmaneser II. mentions a Hittite prince, Sapalulme, king of the <span class= "ital">Patinaa</span>, a tribe on the Orontes. The Hittites from whom Solomon exacted forced labour were those who were left in the land of Israel (comp. Genesis 23, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-34.htm" title="And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:">Genesis 26:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-6.htm" title="So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.">1Samuel 31:6</a>), <span class= "ital">not</span> the people of the great cities mentioned above, which remained independent, as we know from the Assyrian inscriptions.

Twenty years later it revolted under Yahubihdi ("Jah is around me;" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm" title="But you, O LORD, are a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.">Psalm 3:3</a>), but was again reduced, and made an Assyrian prefecture by Sargon, who afterwards stormed Carchemish (B.C. 717). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-30.htm" title="And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,">2Kings 17:30</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The kings of the Egyptians.</span>--The plural may be rhetorical. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-16.htm" title="At that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria to help him.">2Chronicles 28:16</a> : "The kings of Assyria," and Note.) Little is known of the state of Egypt at this time (towards the close of the twenty-second dynasty). The Syrians were seized with panic, under the idea that they were about to be attacked on all sides at once. Some such wild rumour as that expressed by the words of the text must have been spread through the camp; but we need not press the <span class= "ital">literal</span> accuracy of the statement, for who was there to report the exact nature of the alarm to the historians of Israel? Moreover, it is evident from the style of the narrative in chapters 6 and 7 that it rests upon <span class= "ital">oral tradition</span>, so that it would be a mistake to press subordinate details. Prof. Robertson Smith considers that the sudden retreat of the Syrians is explained by the fact that the <span class= "ital">Assyrians</span> were already pressing upon them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, voice, is used for noises of any kind (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-4.htm">Psalm 93:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-13.htm">Ezekiel 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-2.htm">Nahum 3:2</a>), though generally for those in which the human voice preponderated. A noise like that of chariots and of horses and of a great host (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) was borne in upon the ears of the Syrians about nightfall of the day on which Jehoram had determined to put Elisha to death; and, as they expected no reinforcements, they naturally concluded that succor had arrived to help their enemy. How the noise was produced it is impossible to say. Na-rural causes are insufficient; and the writer evidently regards the event as miraculous: "The <span class="accented">Lord had made</span> the host of the Syrians to hear a noise," etc. Nothing can be more weak and irrelevant than to remark, with Bahr," There are instances, even nowadays, that people in certain mountainous regions regard a rushing and roaring sound, such as is sometimes heard there, as a sign of coming war." The Syrians thought they heard the actual arrival of a vast army. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Lo, the King of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites.</span> This supposition has been thought "strange," almost inexplicable. "No such nation as the Hittites any longer existed," says Mr. Sumner ('The Books of the Kings,' vol. 2. p. 72, Eng. trans.). But the Assyrian records of the <span class="date">ninth and eighth centuries B.C.</span> make it evident, not only that the Hittites still existed at that date, but that they were among the most powerful enemies of the Ninevite kings, being located in Northern Syria, about Carchemish (Jerabus) and the adjacent country. It is also apparent that they did not form a centralized monarchy, but were governed by a number of chiefs, or "kings," twelve of whom are mentioned in one place (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 112). It was no very improbable supposition on the part of the Syrians that Jehoram had called in the aid of the Hittite confederacy, and that they had marched an army to his assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the Egyptians.</span> "The plural, kings of the Egyptians," says Keil, "is not to be pressed. It is probably occasioned only by the parallel expression,' kings of the Hittites.'" But Egyptian history shows us that about this date Egypt was becoming disintegrated, and that two or three distinct dynasties were sometimes ruling at the same time, in different parts of the country - one at Bubastis another at Thebes, a third at Tanis, occasionally a fourth at Memphis (see "Ancient Egypt," in 'The Story of the Nations,' p. 311). The writer thus shows a knowledge of the internal condition of Egypt which we should not have expected. To come upon us; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to fall upon us from the north and from the south at the same time. In their panic, the Syrians did not stop to weigh probabilities, or to think how unlikely it was that such a simultaneous attack could have been arranged between powers so remote one from the other. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:3-11 God can, when he pleases, make the stoutest heart to tremble; and as for those who will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shaking of a leaf. Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to report the good tidings to others. From love to him, not from selfish feelings, they will gladly share their earthly good things with their brethren.</body></html>
