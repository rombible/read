(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-32.htm" title="And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.">1Kings 18:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-25.htm" title="And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.">2Kings 6:25</a>.) The prophet's words are more abrupt in the original: "Thus hath Jehovah said, About this time to-morrow a seah (in) fine flour at a shekel, and two seahs (in) barley at a shekel, in the gate of Samaria!"<p><span class= "bld">Fine flour.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm" title="And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes on the hearth.">Genesis 18:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Barley.</span>--Not only as fodder for the horses (Thenius). but also for human consumption, in the shape of barley cakes, &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm" title="And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.">Judges 7:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The gate.</span>--The corn market, therefore, was held in the open space just within the gate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord.</span> This was a very solemn exordium, well calculated to arrest attention. It must be remembered that the prophet's life was trembling in the balance. The executioner was present; the king had not revoked his order; the elders would probably have suffered the king to work his will. All depended on Elisha, by half a dozen words, changing the king's mind. He therefore announces a Divine oracle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>; and for the exact expression, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-4.htm">Jeremiah 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure</span> - literally, a <span class="accented">seah</span> - of fine flour be sold for a shekel. The "seah" was probably about equal to a peck and a half English, the shekel of the time to about half a crown. Thus no extraordinary cheapness is promised, but only an enormous fall in prices from the rate current at the moment (2 Kings 7:25). Such a fall implied, almost necessarily, the discontinuance of the siege. Jehoram appears to have accepted the prophet's solemn asseveration, and on the strength of it to have spared his life, at any rate till the result should be seen. <span class="cmt_word">And two measures</span> - literally, <span class="accented">seahs - <span class="cmt_word"></span>of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</span> The gates, or rather gateways, of Oriental towns were spacious places, where business of various kinds was transacted. One at Nineveh had an area of above two thousand five hundred square feet. Kings often held their courts of justice in the city gates. On this occasion one of the gates of Samaria seems to have been used as a corn-market (comp. vers. 17-20). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1,2 Man's extremity is God's opportunity of making his own power to be glorious: his time to appear for his people is when their strength is gone. Unbelief is a sin by which men greatly dishonour and displease God, and deprive themselves of the favours he designed for them. Such will be the portion of those that believe not the promise of eternal life; they shall see it at a distance, but shall never taste of it. But no temporal deliverances and mercies will in the end profit sinners, unless they are led to repentance by the goodness of God.</body></html>
