This probably happened, as Thenius suggests, when the crowd was <span class= "ital">returning</span> from the Syrian camp, wild with excess of food and drink, after their long abstinence. Thus he "saw the plenty with his eyes, but did not eat thereof" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm" title="Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

It is wanting in some Hebrew MSS., and in the Syriac, Vulg., and Arabic versions. If retained in the text, we must render, "And he died, according to that which the man of God spake, <span class= "ital">which he spake</span> when the king," &c. But perhaps the reading of one Hebrew MS. is correct: "And he died, <span class= "ital">according to the word</span> of the man of God, which he spake," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate.</span> Anticipating disorder, unless special care were taken, through the probable eagerness of the people to purchase the corn which was offered to them at so moderate a rate, Jehoram appointed the officer on whose arm he had leant when he visited the house of Elisha (see ver. 2), to have the charge of the gate, and preside over the sale. Probably there was no thought of the post being one of danger. <span class="cmt_word">And the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.</span> It has been questioned whether the death was accidental (Bahr), and suggested that the eager and famished people resisted his authority, and violently bore down his attempts to control them. But there is nothing in the text that is incompatible with an accidental death. Such deaths ate not uncommon in dense crowds of anxious and excited people. <span class="cmt_word">As the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</span> The varieties of reading here do not affect the general sense. The writer's intention is to lay special stress on the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy; and to emphasize the punishment that follows on a lack of faith. The concluding passage of the chapter is, as Bahr says, "a finger of warning to unbelievers." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:12-20 Here see the wants of Israel supplied in a way they little thought of, which should encourage us to depend upon the power and goodness of God in our greatest straits. God's promise may be safely relied on, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned the truth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame his unbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of the plenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, who think that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeply God resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: how uncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God's threatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty. May God help us to inquire whether we are exposed to his threatenings, or interested in his promises.</body></html>
