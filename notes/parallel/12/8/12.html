"My lord" was the phrase with which slaves addressed their masters, and subjects their monarchs (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-3.htm">2 Kings 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-12.htm">2 Kings 6:12</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.</span> The prophet does not intend to tax Hazael with any special cruelty, he only means to say, "Thou wilt wage long and bloody wars with Israel, in which will occur all those customary horrors that make war so terrible - the burning of cities, the slaughter of the flower of the youth, the violent death of children, and even the massacre of women in a state of pregnancy. These horrors belonged, more or less, to all Oriental wars, and are touched on in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-9.htm">Psalm 137:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>, etc. The wars of Hazael with the Israelites are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3-7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3, 4</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-15 Among other changes of men's minds by affliction, it often gives other thoughts of God's ministers, and teaches to value the counsels and prayers of those whom they have hated and despised. It was not in Hazael's countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but God revealed it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes: the more foresight men have, the more grief they are liable to. It is possible for a man, under the convictions and restraints of natural conscience, to express great abhorrence of a sin, yet afterwards to be reconciled to it. Those that are little and low in the world, cannot imagine how strong the temptations of power and prosperity are, which, if ever they arrive at, they will find how deceitful their hearts are, how much worse than they suspected. The devil ruins men, by saying they shall certainly recover and do well, so rocking them asleep in security. Hazael's false account was an injury to the king, who lost the benefit of the prophet's warning to prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha, who would be counted a false prophet. It is not certain that Hazael murdered his master, or if he caused his death it may have been without any design. But he was a dissembler, and afterwards proved a persecutor to Israel.</body></html>
