Were the reading correct, it would be implied that Jehoram was for some reason or other made king or co-regent in the lifetime of his father, just as Esarhaddon united his heir Assurbanipal with himself in the government of Assyria. But the clause should be omitted as a spurious anticipation of the same words in the next line. So some Hebrew MSS., the Complut., LXX., the Syriac, and Arabic, and many MSS. of the Vulg. The clause as it stands is an unparalleled insertion in a common formula of the compiler, and there is no trace elsewhere of a co-regency of Jehoram with his father. Ewald, after Kimchi, would turn the clause into a sentence, by adding the word <span class= "ital">meth</span>, "had died:" "Now Jehoshaphat the king of Judah had died," an utterly superfluous remark.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-24.</span> - THE WICKED REIGN OF JEHORAM IN JUDAH.

His narrative has to be supplemented from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21.htm">2 Chronicles 21</a>, which contains many facts not mentioned by the writer of Kings. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab King of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then King of Judah</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and of Jehoshaphat King of Judah</span>. The words are wanting in three Hebrew manuscripts, in some editions of the Septuagint, in the Peshito Syriac, in the Parisian Heptaplar Syriac, in the Arabic Version, and in many copies of the Vulgate. They cannot possibly have the sense assigned to them in our version, and are most probably a gloss which has crept into the text from the margin. <span class="cmt_word">Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat King of Judah began to reign.</span> Jehoram's reign was sometimes counted from the seventeenth year of his father, when he was given the royal title, sometimes from his father's twenty-third year, when he was associated, and sometimes from his father's death in his twenty-fifth year, when he became sole king (see the comment on 2 Kings 1:17 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 A general idea is given of Jehoram's badness.
