Under the influence of his wife Athaliah, as it may be surmised, Jehoram slew his six brothers directly after his accession to the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm" title="Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brothers with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.">2Chronicles 21:4</a>). In this connection the remarks of Michaelis are interesting: "In the reign of Jehoram falls the building of Carthage; Dido, her husband Sichaeus, her brother Pygmalion, king of Tyre, and murderer of Sichaeus. By marriage Tyre brought its then prevalent spirit, and a vast amount of evil,into the two Israelitish kingdoms." (The Syriac, Arabic, and Vulg. read "in the ways.") The reason why the details added in Chronicles are here omitted is to be found in the studied brevity of the compiler in the case of less important characters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he introduced into Judah the Baal and Astarte worship, which Ahab had introduced into Israel from Phoenicia. (On the nature of this worship, see the ' Commentary on the First Book of Kings,' p. 374.) The "house of Ahab" maintained and spread the Baal-worship, wherever it had influence. Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, championed it in Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-53.htm">1 Kings 22:53</a>); Jehoram, his brother, allowed its continuance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>); Jehoram of Judah was induced by his wife, Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, to countenance it in Judaea; Athaliah, when she usurped the throne upon the death of her son Ahaziah, made it the state religion in that country. "Evil communications corrupt good manners." The alliance of the two separated kingdoms, concluded between Jehoshaphat and Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2-4</a>), had no tangible result beyond the introduction into Judah of the licentious and debasing superstition which had previously overspread the sister country. <span class="cmt_word">For the daughter of Ahab was his wife.</span> In ver. 26 Athaliah, the wife of Jehoram, is called "the daughter of Omri;" but by "daughter" in that place must be meant "descendant" or "granddaughter." Athaliah has been well called "a second Jezebel." <span class="cmt_word">And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> The wicked actions of Jehoram are recorded at some length in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2-4, 11-13</a>). Shortly after his accession he put to death his six brothers - Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Ahaziah (?), Michael, and Shephatiah - in order to "strengthen himself." At the same time, he caused many of the "princes of Israel" to be executed. Soon afterwards he "made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to become idolaters), "and compelled Judah thereto." That the idolatry, which he introduced, was the Baal-worship is clear, both from the present passage and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-13.htm">2 Chronicles 21:13</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 A general idea is given of Jehoram's badness. His father, no doubt, had him taught the true knowledge of the Lord, but did ill to marry him to the daughter of Ahab; no good could come of union with an idolatrous family.</body></html>
