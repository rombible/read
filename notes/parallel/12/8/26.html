Yet he had several elder brothers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a>)! To explain this, we have to remember <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the early age at which marriage is contracted in the East (twelve years); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fact that each prince had, besides his wife, several concubines. That Joram had several appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's Ares was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri King of Israel</span>. There is something very remarkable in the dignity and precedence attached to Omri. He was, no doubt, regarded of a sort of second founder of the kingdom of Israel, having been the first monarch to establish anything like a stable dynasty. His "statutes" were looked upon as the fundamental laws of the kingdom, and were "kept" down to the time of its destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>). Foreigners knew Samaria as <span class="accented">Beth</span>. <span class="accented">Khumri</span>, or "the house of Omri." He is the only Israelite king mentioned by name on the Moabite Stone (line 5), and the earliest mentioned in the inscriptions of Assyria. Even Jehu, who put an end to his dynasty, was regarded by the Assyrians as his descendant, and known under the designation of" Yahua, the son of Khnmri" (Black Obelisk, epig. 2.). Athallah, the daughter of Ahab, is called "the daughter of Omri," not only in the present passage, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:25-29 Names do not make natures, but it was bad for Jehoshaphat's family to borrow names from Ahab's. Ahaziah's relation to Ahab's family was the occasion of his wickedness and of his fall. When men choose wives for themselves, let them remember they are choosing mothers for their children. Providence so ordered it, that Ahaziah might be cut off with the house of Ahab, when the measure of their iniquity was full. Those who partake with sinners in their sin, must expect to partake with them in their plagues. May all the changes, troubles, and wickedness of the world, make us more earnest to obtain an interest in the salvation of Christ.</body></html>
