(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-7.htm" title="However, the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.">2Chronicles 21:7</a>, Note.) Keil adopts the same reading, but translates, "To give him, that is, his sons, a lamp," making "to his sons" an explanatory apposition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake.</span> The natural punishment of apostasy was rejection by God, and on rejection would, as a matter of course, follow destruction and ruin. God had declared by Moses, "If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and statutes, which I command thee this day; all these curses shall come upon thee The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, <span class="accented">until thou be destroyed</span>, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me. The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, <span class="accented">until he have consumed thee from off the land</span>, whither thou goest to possess it. The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee <span class="accented">till thou perish</span>. And thy heaven which is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is underneath thee shall be iron.... The Lord shall cause thee to be smitten of thine enemies; thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and thou shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.... Thou shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the Lord shall lead thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-37</a>). The apostasy of Jeheram, and of the nation under him, was calculated to bring about the immediate fulfillment of all these threats, and would have done so but for a restraining cause. God had made promises to David, and to his seed after him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29-37</a>, etc.), which would be unfulfilled if Judah's candlestick were at once removed. He had declared, "If thy children forsake my Law, and walk not in my statutes... I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges. Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take away, nor suffer my truth to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips; I have sworn once by my holiness that I will not fail David." If he had now swept away the Jewish kingdom, he would have dealt more hardly with these who clave to David than with those that broke off from him. He would not have shown the "faithfulness" or the "mercy" which he had promised, he would have forgotten "the loving-kindnesses which he aware unto David in his truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-49.htm">Psalm 89:49</a>). Therefore he would not - he <span class="accented">could</span> not - as yet "destroy Judah," with which, in point of fact, he bore for above three centuries longer, until at last the cup of their iniquities was full, and "there was no remedy." <span class="cmt_word">As he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.</span> There is no "and" in the original. Translate - <span class="accented">As he promised him to give him always a light in respect of his children</span>, and compare, for the promise of "a light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 A general idea is given of Jehoram's badness.
