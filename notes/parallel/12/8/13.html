The true sense, which is well represented in the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>;), is - "But what is thy servant, this dog, that he should do so great a thing?" Hazael does not accuse Elisha of making him out a dog in the future, but calls himself a dog in the present. "Dog" is a word of extreme contempt - "the most contemptuous epithet of abuse" (Winer), as appears, among other places, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a>. Hazael means to say - How is it possible that he, occupying, as he does, so poor and humble a position as that of a mere courtier or domestic (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, Josephus), should ever wage war with Israel, and do the "great things" which Elisha has predicted of him? <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha answered, The Lord hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.</span> Elisha explains how it would be possible. Hazael would not continue in his poor and humble condition. Jehovah has revealed it to him that the mere courtier will shortly mount the Syrian throne. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-15 Among other changes of men's minds by affliction, it often gives other thoughts of God's ministers, and teaches to value the counsels and prayers of those whom they have hated and despised. It was not in Hazael's countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but God revealed it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes: the more foresight men have, the more grief they are liable to. It is possible for a man, under the convictions and restraints of natural conscience, to express great abhorrence of a sin, yet afterwards to be reconciled to it. Those that are little and low in the world, cannot imagine how strong the temptations of power and prosperity are, which, if ever they arrive at, they will find how deceitful their hearts are, how much worse than they suspected. The devil ruins men, by saying they shall certainly recover and do well, so rocking them asleep in security. Hazael's false account was an injury to the king, who lost the benefit of the prophet's warning to prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha, who would be counted a false prophet. It is not certain that Hazael murdered his master, or if he caused his death it may have been without any design. But he was a dissembler, and afterwards proved a persecutor to Israel.</body></html>
