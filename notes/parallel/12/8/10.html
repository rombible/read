But (1) the position of the negative before the adverbial infinitive is anomalous; and (2) Hazae?s report of Elisha's words, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-14.htm" title="So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to you?

The Authorised Version is, therefore, right.<p><span class= "bld">Thou mayest certainly recover.</span>--Rather. <span class= "ital">Thou wilt certainly live</span>. Elisha sees through Hazae?s character and designs, and answers him in the tone of irony which he used to Gehazi in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-26.htm" title="And he said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?">2Kings 5:26</a>, "Go, tell thy lord--as thou, the supple and unscrupulous courtier wilt be sure to do--he will certainly recover. I know, however, that he will assuredly die, and by thy hand." Others interpret, "<span class= "ital">Thou mightest</span> recover" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, thy disease is not mortal); and make the rest of the prophe?s reply a confidential communication to Hazael. But this is to represent the prophet as deceiving Benhadad, and guilty of complicity with Hazael, which agrees neither with Elisha's character nor with what follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/8-11.htm" title="And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.">2Kings 8:11-12</a>.

The emendation in the Hebrew margin (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>), accepted by all the versions, and by almost all commentators, is thus certain. Our translators are therefore, so far, in the right; but they were not entitled to tone down the strong affirmative, <span class="accented">khayih thikhyah</span>, "<span class="accented">living</span> thou shalt live," or "thou shalt surely live," into the weak potential, "thou mayest certainly recover." What Elisha says to Hazael is, "Go, say unto him, Thou shalt surely live;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Go, say unto him, what thou hast already made up thy mind to say, what a courtier is sure to say, Thou shalt recover." <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the Lord hath showed me that he shall surely die.</span> If Hazael had reported the whole answer to Benhadad, he would have told no lie, and thus Elisha is not responsible for his lie. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-15 Among other changes of men's minds by affliction, it often gives other thoughts of God's ministers, and teaches to value the counsels and prayers of those whom they have hated and despised. It was not in Hazael's countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but God revealed it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes: the more foresight men have, the more grief they are liable to. It is possible for a man, under the convictions and restraints of natural conscience, to express great abhorrence of a sin, yet afterwards to be reconciled to it. Those that are little and low in the world, cannot imagine how strong the temptations of power and prosperity are, which, if ever they arrive at, they will find how deceitful their hearts are, how much worse than they suspected. The devil ruins men, by saying they shall certainly recover and do well, so rocking them asleep in security. Hazael's false account was an injury to the king, who lost the benefit of the prophet's warning to prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha, who would be counted a false prophet. It is not certain that Hazael murdered his master, or if he caused his death it may have been without any design. But he was a dissembler, and afterwards proved a persecutor to Israel.</body></html>
