By many repetitions the history of the prophets took a fixed shape long before it was committed to writing, and the written record preserves all the essential features of the narratives that passed from mouth to mouth, and were handed down orally from father to child." (Prof. Robertson Smith, <span class= "ital">The Prophets of Israel</span>, p. 116.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king talked with Gehazi</span>; rather, <span class="accented">now the king was talking with Gehazi</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the Revised Version. The king, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, happened to be talking with Gehazi at the moment when the woman came into his presence and "cried" to him. It has been reasonably concluded from this, that chronological order is not observed in the portion of the narrative which treats of Elisha and his doings, since a king of Israel would scarcely be in familiar conversation with a leper (Keil). It may be added that Gehazi can scarcely have continued to be the servant of Elisha, as he evidently now was, after his leprosy. He must have dwelt "without the gate." <span class="cmt_word">The servant of the man of God.</span> That a king should converse with a servant is, no doubt, somewhat unusual; but, as Bahr notes, there is nothing in the circumstance that need astonish us. It is natural enough that, having been himself a witness of so many of the prophet's marvelous acts done in public, Jehoram should become curious concerning those other marvelous acts which he had performed in private, among his personal friends and associates, with respect to which many turnouts must have got abroad; and should wish to obtain an account of them from a source on which he could rely. If he had this desire, he could scarcely apply to the prophet himself, with whom he was at no time on familiar terms, and who would shrink from enlarging on his own miraculous powers. "To whom, then, could he apply with more propriety for this information than to the prophet's familiar servant" - an eye-witness of most of them, and one who would have no reason for reticence? Oriental ideas would not be shocked by the king's sending for any subject from whom he desired information, and questioning him. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</span> Miracles are often called "great things" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) in the Old Testament, but generally in connection with God as the doer of them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-10.htm">Job 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-5.htm">Job 37:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-19.htm">Psalm 71:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-21.htm">Psalm 106:21</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The kindness of the good Shunammite to Elisha, was rewarded by the care taken of her in famine. It is well to foresee an evil, and wisdom, when we foresee it, to hide ourselves if we lawfully may do so. When the famine was over, she returned out of the land of the Philistines; that was no proper place for an Israelite, any longer than there was necessity for it. Time was when she dwelt so securely among her own people, that she had no occasion to be spoken for to the king; but there is much uncertainty in this life, so that things or persons may fail us which we most depend upon, and those befriend us which we think we shall never need. Sometimes events, small in themselves, prove of consequence, as here; for they made the king ready to believe Gehazi's narrative, when thus confirmed. It made him ready to grant her request, and to support a life which was given once and again by miracle.</body></html>
