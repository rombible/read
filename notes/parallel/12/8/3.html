Her own land, where she could have the ministrations of a "man of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), was dear to her; and no sooner had the famine abated than she returned to it. <span class="cmt_word">And she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.</span> During her prolonged absence, some grasping neighbor had seized on the unoccupied house and the uncultivated estate adjoining it, and now refused to restore them to the rightful owner. Widows were especially liable to such treatment on the part of greedy oppressors, since they were, comparatively speaking, weak and defenseless (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>). Under such circumstances the injured party would naturally, in an Oriental country, make appeal to the king (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-4.htm">2 Samuel 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-26.htm">2 Kings 6:26</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The kindness of the good Shunammite to Elisha, was rewarded by the care taken of her in famine. It is well to foresee an evil, and wisdom, when we foresee it, to hide ourselves if we lawfully may do so. When the famine was over, she returned out of the land of the Philistines; that was no proper place for an Israelite, any longer than there was necessity for it. Time was when she dwelt so securely among her own people, that she had no occasion to be spoken for to the king; but there is much uncertainty in this life, so that things or persons may fail us which we most depend upon, and those befriend us which we think we shall never need. Sometimes events, small in themselves, prove of consequence, as here; for they made the king ready to believe Gehazi's narrative, when thus confirmed. It made him ready to grant her request, and to support a life which was given once and again by miracle.</body></html>
