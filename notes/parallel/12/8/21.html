The Vulg. has <span class= "ital">Seira</span>, and the Arabic <span class= "ital">Sa'ira,</span> which suggest an original reading, "to Seir," the well-known mountain chain which was the headquarters of the Edomite people. Perhaps the reading of the text <span class= "ital">�?'ir?h</span> represents a dialectic pronunciation. (Comp. the forms <span class= "ital">Yish?q</span> and <span class= "ital">Yich?q</span> for Isaac.)<p><span class= "bld">And he rose by night.</span>--There may be a <span class= "ital">lacuna</span> of a few lines in the text here, or the compiler, in his desire to be brief, may have become obscure.

(Comp. for the proverbial expression, "to their tents," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is my iniquity? and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?">1Samuel 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm" title="On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.">1Kings 8:66</a>.)

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm" title="And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.">Genesis 27:40</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Joram went over to Zair.</span> Naturally, Joram did not allow Edom to become independent without an attempt to reduce it. He invaded the country in full force, taking up a position at a place called Zair, which is not otherwise known. Zair (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) can scarcely be Zoar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), which, wherever it was, was certainly not in Edom; and it is hardly likely to be a corruption of "Seir" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>), since the utterly unknown <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> would scarcely be put by a copyist in the place of the well-known <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>. Moreover, if Mount Seir were intended, it would probably have had the prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-2.htm">Ezekiel 35:2, 3, 7, 15</a>. "Seir" alone is poetical rather than historical, especially in the language of the later books of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">And all the chariots with him</span>; or, <span class="accented">all his chariots</span> (Revised Version). The article has the force of the possessive pronoun. <span class="cmt_word">And he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about.</span> Josephus understands the writer to mean that Joram made his invasion by night, and smote the Edomites on all sides ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:5. &sect; 1); but it seems better to suppose, with most modern commentators, that the meaning is the following: Soon after Joram invaded the country, he found himself surrounded and blocked in by the Edomite troops, and could only save himself by a night attack, which was so far successful that he broke through the enemy's lines and escaped; his army, however, was so alarmed at the danger it had run, that it at once dispersed and returned home<span class="cmt_word">. And the captains of the chariots</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the captains of the Edomite chariots. They too were "smitten," having probably taken the chief part in trying to prevent the escape. <span class="cmt_word">And the people fled into their tents</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dispersed to their homes. Compare the cry of Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>), "To your tents, O Israel!" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 A general idea is given of Jehoram's badness. His father, no doubt, had him taught the true knowledge of the Lord, but did ill to marry him to the daughter of Ahab; no good could come of union with an idolatrous family.</body></html>
