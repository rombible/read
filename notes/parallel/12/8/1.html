And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.">2Kings 8:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Go thou.</span>--The peculiar form of the pronoun points to the identity of the original author of this account with the writer of 2 Kings 4. Moreover, the famine here foretold appears to be that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm" title="And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.">2Kings 4:38</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>., so that the present section must in the original document have preceded 2 Kings 5. Thenius thinks the compiler transferred the present account to this place, because he wished to proceed chronologically, and supposed that the seven years' famine came to an end with the raising of the siege of Samaria.<p><span class= "bld">For a famine.</span>--<span class= "ital">To the famine</span>. The sword, the famine, the noisome beasts, and the pestilence were Jehovah's "four sore judgments," as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?">Ezekiel 14:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And it shall also come upon.</span>--<span class= "ital">And, moreover, it cometh into</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Seven Years.</span>--Perhaps not to be understood literally, any more than Dante's<p>"O caro Duca mio che <span class= "ital">pi� di sette<p>Volte</span> m'hai sicurta. renduta."--Inferno 8. 97.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life.</span> There is no "then" in the original, of which the simplest rendering would be, "And Elisha spake unto the woman," etc. The true sense is, perhaps, best brought out by the Revised Version, which gives the following: <span class="accented">Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman</span>, etc. The reference is to a time long anterior to the siege of Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the Lord hath called for a famine.</span> A famine is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>, which must belong to the reign of Jehoram, and which is probably identified with that here spoken cf. Elisha, on its approach, recommended the Shunammite, though she was a woman of substance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>), to quit her home and remove to some other residence, where she mighty, escape the pressure of the calamity He left it to her to choose the place of her temporary abode. The phrase, "God hath <span class="accented">called for</span> a famine," means no more and no less than "God has determined that there shall be a famine." With God to speak the word is to bring about the event. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall also come upon the land seven years.</span> Seven years was the actual duration of the great famine, which Joseph foretold in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>), and was the ideally perfect period for a severe famine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13</a>). Many of the best meteorologists are inclined to regard the term of "seven years" as a cyclic period in connection with weather changes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The kindness of the good Shunammite to Elisha, was rewarded by the care taken of her in famine. It is well to foresee an evil, and wisdom, when we foresee it, to hide ourselves if we lawfully may do so. When the famine was over, she returned out of the land of the Philistines; that was no proper place for an Israelite, any longer than there was necessity for it. Time was when she dwelt so securely among her own people, that she had no occasion to be spoken for to the king; but there is much uncertainty in this life, so that things or persons may fail us which we most depend upon, and those befriend us which we think we shall never need. Sometimes events, small in themselves, prove of consequence, as here; for they made the king ready to believe Gehazi's narrative, when thus confirmed. It made him ready to grant her request, and to support a life which was given once and again by miracle.</body></html>
