His reign synchronises with that of Samas-Rimmon in Assyria, who made no expeditions to the West (B.C. 825-812). The name Ben-hadad does not, of course, signify any connection with the dynasty overthrown by Hazael. It was a Divine title (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-24.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.">2Kings 6:24</a>.)<p>Benhadad was probably a feebler sovereign than Hazael. The rule, "Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis," is perhaps as often contradicted as corroborated by actual experience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Hazael King of Syria died</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and Hazael</span>... <span class="accented">died</span>.

It appears by ver. 22 that he outlived Jehoahaz. <span class="cmt_word">And Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.</span> Hazael, the usurper, gave his eldest son the name of the monarch whom he had murdered. It was an old royal name in Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), having been borne by at least two of Hazael's predecessors. The meaning which has been assigned to it ("Son of the sun") is doubtful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:20-25 God has many ways to chastise a provoking people. Trouble comes sometimes from that point whence we least feared it. The mention of this invasion on the death of Elisha, shows that the removal of God's faithful prophets is a presage of coming judgments. His dead body was a means of giving life to another dead body. This miracle was a confirmation of his prophecies. And it may have reference to Christ, by whose death and burial, the grave is made a safe and happy passage to life to all believers. Jehoash was successful against the Syrians, just as often as he had struck the ground with the arrows, then a stop was put to his victories. Many have repented, when too late, of distrusts and the straitness of their desires.</body></html>
