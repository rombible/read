(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.">2Kings 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-2.htm" title="And when you come thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber;">2Kings 9:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">All their days.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">all the days, i.e.</span>, continually (<span class= "ital">not</span> all the days of Jehoahaz, nor of Hazael and Ben-hadad). The phrase is an indefinite designation of a long period of disaster.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the three and twentieth year of Joash</span>; rather, as in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 5), <span class="accented">in the one and twentieth year</span>. This is a correction required by ver. 10 and also by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>. The proof is given at somewhat tedious length by Keil ('Biblical Commentary,' pp. 373, 374) and Bahr ('Books of the Kings,' pp. 139, 140). It seems unnecessary to enter into a lengthy discussion of the point, since all the synchronisms of the later kings of Israel and Judah are in confusion, and appear to be the work of a later hand. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Ahaziah</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>) <span class="cmt_word">King of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">reigned over Israel</span>. The "later hand," which inserted the synchronism, neglected to bring the two portions of the verse into agreement. Our translators have sought to cover up his omission by translating <span class="accented">malak</span> "began to <span class="accented">reign</span>," and then supplying "and reigned" in the next clause. And reigned <span class="cmt_word">seventeen years</span> (so also Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 It was the ancient honour of Israel that they were a praying people. Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.</body></html>
