Jehu had done the same (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>), as had all previous kings of Israel from the time of Jeroboam. The honor of God, however, required that idolatry of whatever kind should be punished, and the Samaritan kingdom could not otherwise be saved from destruction than by, "casting away <span class="accented">all</span> the works of darkness" and returning to the <span class="accented">pure</span> worship of Jehovah. Hence Jehu himself, notwithstanding the good service that he had done in crushing the Baal-worship, was chastised by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>) on account of his continuance in the "sin of Jeroboam;" and now Jehoahaz was even more signally punished.

This is emphatic. Jehoahaz kept up the worship to the full, and in no way suffered it to decline. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 It was the ancient honour of Israel that they were a praying people. Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.</body></html>
