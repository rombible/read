While he was still punishing Israel by the sword of Hazael, he was yet careful not to make a full end, not to allow the affliction to proceed too far. He still preserved the nation, and kept it in being. <span class="cmt_word">And had respect unto them</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "considered them - kept them in his mind - did not permit them to slip out of his recollection" - <span class="cmt_word">because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span> God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was a covenant of mercy. By it he had pledged himself to multiply their seed, to be their God, and the God of their seed after them, and to give to their seed the whole land of Canaan for an <span class="accented">everlasting</span> possession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-8</a>, etc.). This covenant bound him to extend his protection over the people of Israel so long as they had not utterly and entirely cast off their allegiance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And would not destroy them.</span> They were "persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-9.htm">2 Corinthians 4:9</a>). The national life might seem to hang by a thread, but the thread had not snapped. <span class="cmt_word">Neither east he them from his presence as yet.</span> The writer has it in his mind that ultimately they were cast away, rejected, removed out of God's sight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18, 20, 23</a>); but it was not "as yet" - there was still an interval of a century, or a little more, before the blow fell, and the nation of the ten tribes ceased to exist. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:20-25 God has many ways to chastise a provoking people. Trouble comes sometimes from that point whence we least feared it. The mention of this invasion on the death of Elisha, shows that the removal of God's faithful prophets is a presage of coming judgments. His dead body was a means of giving life to another dead body. This miracle was a confirmation of his prophecies. And it may have reference to Christ, by whose death and burial, the grave is made a safe and happy passage to life to all believers. Jehoash was successful against the Syrians, just as often as he had struck the ground with the arrows, then a stop was put to his victories. Many have repented, when too late, of distrusts and the straitness of their desires.</body></html>
