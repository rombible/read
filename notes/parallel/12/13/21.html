In this case, we must suppose that the tomb was more easily opened, as the action was obviously done in haste.<p><span class= "bld">And when the man was let down, and touched the bones.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and they departed. And the man touched the bones.</span> The order of words in the original, as well as the sense, supports old Houbigan?s conjecture. If the meaning were, "and the man went and touched," the subject in the Hebrew would have followed the first verb, not the second. Moreover, the verb would hardly have been <span class= "ital">h?lak</span>.<p><span class= "bld">He revived.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and he lived</span>. Thenius thinks that the sacred writer regarded this miracle as a pledge of the fulfilment of Elisha's promise to Joash Bahr says: "Elisha died and was buried, like all other men, but even in death and in the grave he is avouched to be the prophet and servant of God." Dante's warning may not be out of place here:--<p>"O voi che avete g?intelletti sani,<p>Mirate la dottrina, che s asconde<p>Sotto il velame degli versi strani."<p><span class= "ital">Inf</span>. 9:61, <span class= "ital">sqq</span>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that.</span> "They" is used indefinitely of some unnamed Israelites, like the French on. Certain persons, it does not matter who, were burying a man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about to bury him, and were carrying the corpse to the grave, when an interruption occurred. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, they spied a band of men</span> - rather, <span class="accented">the band</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">the</span> band of that year - <span class="cmt_word">and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha.</span> There was no time for ceremony. Hastily, and somewhat roughly, it may be, the bearers of the body thrust it into Elisha's tomb, which happened to be at hand, and from the mouth of which they were able to remove the closing stone. They did not "throw" the body in, but pushed it in. <span class="cmt_word">And when the man was let down.</span> The man was not "let down." Our translators seem to have been unacquainted with the Jewish mode of burial. They imagine that Elisha's tomb is a pit dug in the ground from the surface downwards, like a modern grave, and the man has therefore to be "let <span class="accented">down</span>," or to "go <span class="accented">down"</span> (marginal translation) into it. The Revised Version avoids the mistranslation, but weakens the force of the original. Translate, <span class="accented">and when the man came</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And touched the bones of Elisha, he revived.</span> The violent push given to the corpse imparted to it a movement which brought it in contact with the bones, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-31.htm">1 Kings 13:31</a>) of Elisha, as it lay, wound in its grave-clothes, but uncoffined, on the floor of the sepulchral chamber. At the moment of contact the dead man came to life - "revived." <span class="cmt_word">And stood up on his feet.</span> In many Jewish tombs the sepulchral chamber would allow of this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:20-25 God has many ways to chastise a provoking people. Trouble comes sometimes from that point whence we least feared it. The mention of this invasion on the death of Elisha, shows that the removal of God's faithful prophets is a presage of coming judgments. His dead body was a means of giving life to another dead body. This miracle was a confirmation of his prophecies. And it may have reference to Christ, by whose death and burial, the grave is made a safe and happy passage to life to all believers. Jehoash was successful against the Syrians, just as often as he had struck the ground with the arrows, then a stop was put to his victories. Many have repented, when too late, of distrusts and the straitness of their desires.</body></html>
