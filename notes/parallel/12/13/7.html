And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.">1Kings 16:15</a>). The subject appears to be Jehovah. The narrative returns, after the long parenthesis, to the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm" title="And Jehoahaz sought the LORD, and the LORD listened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.">2Kings 13:4</a>, "and Jehoahaz besought Jehovah (for he had not left, &c.)."

The destruction of these particular kinds of forces was equivalent to complete disarmament, and rendered further resistance hopeless, as the Syrians were especially strong in chariots and horsemen. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm" title="And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.">2Kings 2:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Had made them like the dust by threshing.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and set them like the dust to trample on or tread underfoot.

The meaning seems to be that Hazael limited the standing army of Jehoahaz to fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, not that he slew the entire military population except this small remnant. The policy of limiting the forces to be maintained by a subject-king was one known to the Romans, and has often been adopted in the East. It is still a part of our own policy in the government of India. The limitation left the country at the mercy of all its neighbors (see ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">For the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</span> Possibly this means no more than an utter destruction - a trampling in the dust, as we phrase it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12, 13</a>; and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>). But it may be an allusion to that destruction of prisoners by means of a threshing instrument, which was certainly sometimes practiced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a>), and which is made a special charge against Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. See Pusey's 'Minor Prophets,' p. 158). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 It was the ancient honour of Israel that they were a praying people. Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.</body></html>
