The natural irritability of the sick man may also have had something to do with it. Thenius well remarks on the manifestly <span class= "ital">historical</span> character of the entire scene. It may be added that, to appreciate it fully, we must remember that <span class= "greekheb">???????????</span>, or soothsaying by means of arrows, was a practice of unknown antiquity in the Semitic world. Shooting an arrow, and observing where and how it fell, was one method of trying to fathom the secrets of that Power which overrules events and foreknows the future. The proceedings of David and Jonathan, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-35.htm" title="And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.">1Samuel 20:35</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>., appear to have been an instance of this sort of divination, which in principle is quite analogous to <span class= "ital">casting lots,</span> a practice so familiar to readers of the Bible. The second process--that described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-18.htm" title="And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite on the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.">2Kings 13:18</a>--seems equally to have depended upon chance, according to modern ideas. The prophet left it to the spontaneous <span class= "ital">impulse</span> of the king to determine the number of strokes; because he believed that the result, whatever it was, would <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a>). Elisha's <span class= "ital">anger</span> was the natural anger of the man and the patriot, disappointed at the result of a divination from which he had hoped greater things. In conclusion, it cannot be too often or too forcibly urged upon students of the true religion that the essential differences which isolate it from all imperfect or retrograde systems are to be found not so much in matters of outward organisation, form, and ritual, such as priesthoods and sacrifices, prophets and modes of divination, which were pretty much the same everywhere in Semitic antiquity; but in the inward spirit and substance of its teaching, in the vital truths which it handed on through successive ages, and, above all, in its steady progress from lower to higher conceptions of the Divine character and purposes, and of the right relations of man to God and his fellow-creatures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">was wroth with him.</span> Elisha was angered at the lukewarmness of Joash, and his lack of faith and zeal. He himself, from his higher standpoint, saw the greatness of the opportunity, the abundance of favor which God was ready to grant, and the way in which God's favor was stinted and narrowed by Joash's want of receptiveness. Had the king been equal to the occasion, a full end might at once have been made of Syria, and Israel might have been enabled to brace herself for the still more perilous struggle with Assyria, in which she ultimately succumbed. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it.</span> It has been suggested that Joash associated the number throe with the notion of completeness, and "thought that what was done thrice was done perfectly" (Bahr); but in this case the prophet would scarcely have been angered. It is far more consonant with the entire narrative to suppose that he stopped from mere weariness, and want of strong faith and zeal. If he had been earnestly desirous of victory, and had had faith in the symbolical action as divinely directed, he would have kept on smiting till the prophet told him it was enough, or at any rate would have smitten the ground five or six times instead of three. The idea that he abstained from modesty or from prudence, "lest too extravagant demands might deprive him of all" (Von Gerlach), finds no support in the text of the narrative. He abstained (as Keil says) because "he was wanting in the proper zeal for obtaining the full promises of God." Had it been otherwise, the complete success obtained by Jeroboam II. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-25.htm">2 Kings 4:25-28</a>) might have been anticipated by the space of fifteen or twenty years. <span class="cmt_word">Whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice</span> (comp. ver. 25, which declares that this prophecy was exactly accomplished). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:10-19 Jehoash, the king, came to Elisha, to receive his dying counsel and blessing. It may turn much to our spiritual advantage, to attend the sick-beds and death-beds of good men, that we may be encouraged in religion by the living comforts they have from it in a dying hour. Elisha assured the king of his success; yet he must look up to God for direction and strength; must reckon his own hands not enough, but go on, in dependence upon Divine aid. The trembling hands of the dying prophet, as they signified the power of God, gave this arrow more force than the hands of the king in his full strength. By contemning the sign, the king lost the thing signified, to the grief of the dying prophet. It is a trouble to good men, to see those to whom they wish well, forsake their own mercies, and to see them lose advantages against spiritual enemies.</body></html>
