Still, we must remember the coarse, lewd dancing which accompanied the first calf-worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>), for which death was not thought too heavy a penalty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-27.htm">Exodus 32:27</a>), and the almost universal combination of unchastity with idolatrous ceremonies, which raises a suspicion that those who frequented the shrines at Dan and Bethel were not wholly innocent of impurity. <span class="cmt_word">And he delivered them into the hand of Hazel King of Syria.</span> The national sins of Israel were mostly punished in this way, by the sword of some foreign foe. Hazael had been already made an instrument for the chastisement of Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>). Now he was to chastise Jehoahaz still more severely. <span class="cmt_word">And into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all the days</span>. Not certainly all the days of the two kings Hazael and Benhadad, for Benhadad was entirely worsted in his war with Joash (vers. 24, 25), but either all the days of Jehoahaz, or all the days that God had appointed for the duration of the calamity. It is perhaps against the former interpretation that Hazael appears to have outlived Jehoahaz (vers. 22-24); but Ben-hadad may have warred against him as his father's general (ver. 25) during his father's lifetime. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 It was the ancient honour of Israel that they were a praying people. Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.</body></html>
