The historian added it by way of pointing out that although the prayer of Jehoahaz did not meet with immediate response, it was not ultimately ineffectual.<p><span class= "bld">For he saw the oppression.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm" title="And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-7.htm" title="And when we cried to the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labor, and our oppression:">Deuteronomy 26:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The king of Syria.</span>--Intentionally general, so as to include both Hazael and Ben-hadad III., his son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-24.htm" title="So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.">2Kings 13:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoahaz besought the Lord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">besought the face of the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-6.htm">1 Kings 13:6</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). Jehoahaz, as Josephus says, "betook him-serf to prayer and supplication of God, entreating that he would deliver him out of the hands of Hazael, and not suffer him to continue subject" ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 5). He did not turn from his sin of idolatry, perhaps did not suspect that it was this sin which had provoked God's anger; but in a general way he repented, humbled himself, and besought God's mercy and assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord hearkened unto him.</span> God accepted his repentance, all imperfect as it was, so far as to save the people from the entire destruction with which it was threatened by the severe measures of Hazael (ver. 7), to continue the national existence (ver. 23), and ultimately to restore the national prosperity (ver. 25 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-27</a>). But he did not remove the oppression, as Josephus imagines, in Jehoahaz's time. Ver. 22 makes this fact absolutely certain. <span class="cmt_word">For he saw the oppression of Israel, because the King of Syria oppressed them.</span> Oppression is always hateful to God, even when he is using it as his instrument for chastising or punishing a guilty people. He "sees" it, notes it, lays it up in his remembrance for future retribution (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>, etc.). (On the nature and extent of the oppression of this period, see ver. 7, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 It was the ancient honour of Israel that they were a praying people. Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.</body></html>
