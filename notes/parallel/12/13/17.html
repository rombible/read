The prophet ordered the shutter to be opened, that the king might shoot from the window. He addressed, not the king, whose hands were both engaged, but his own servant, or one of the royal attendants. <span class="cmt_word">Eastward</span>. Not so much in the direction of Syria, which was north-east of the Israelite territory, as in the direction of Gilead and Bashan, which had been the scene of Hazael's victories (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>), and was now to be the scene of his reverses.

"This is," the prophet meant to say, "an arrow symbolical of deliverance about to come from Jehovah, of deliverance from the cruel oppression of the Syrians" - and not merely of deliverance, but of victory. <span class="cmt_word">For thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek.</span> The Aphek intended is probably that which lay east of the Sea of Galilee, at the distance of about three miles, in lat. 32&deg; 49' nearly. This place was on the direct route between Samaria and Damascus, and had already been the scene of one great victory gained by Israel over Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26-30</a>). The site is marked by the modern village of <span class="accented">Fik</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Till thou have consumed them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">till consuming - i.e.</span>, till the army which thou shalt defeat at that place is destroyed utterly. We have no account of the fulfillment of this prophecy, but may regard the defeat as one of those touched on in ver. 25. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:10-19 Jehoash, the king, came to Elisha, to receive his dying counsel and blessing. It may turn much to our spiritual advantage, to attend the sick-beds and death-beds of good men, that we may be encouraged in religion by the living comforts they have from it in a dying hour. Elisha assured the king of his success; yet he must look up to God for direction and strength; must reckon his own hands not enough, but go on, in dependence upon Divine aid. The trembling hands of the dying prophet, as they signified the power of God, gave this arrow more force than the hands of the king in his full strength. By contemning the sign, the king lost the thing signified, to the grief of the dying prophet. It is a trouble to good men, to see those to whom they wish well, forsake their own mercies, and to see them lose advantages against spiritual enemies.</body></html>
