He shall not return thither any more:">Jeremiah 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a>), which may have been his name before his accession. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.">2Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2Kings 24:17</a>.) Hitzig suggested that he was so called by Jeremiah in allusion to his brief reign, as if he were a <span class= "ital">second</span> Shallum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-13.htm" title="Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.">2Kings 15:13</a>). It is against this that Shallum was not a Judean prince, but an obscure adventurer who usurped the throne of Samaria a hundred and fifty years previously, so that the allusion would not be very clear.<p><span class= "bld">Hamutal.</span>--"Akin to dew." (Comp. Abital, "father of dew," or perhaps, "the father is dew.") <span class= "ital">Tal</span>, however, may be a divine name; the meaning then is, "Tal is a kinsman." (Comp. Hamuel, "El is a kinsman.")<p>(34) <span class= "bld">Turned his name to Jehoiakim.</span>--A slight change. Eliakim is "El setteth up;" Jehoiakim, "Jah setteth up." Necho meant to signify that the new king was his creature. Eliakim, the elder son, may have paid court to Necho; or the Egyptian may have deposed Jehoahaz, as elected without his consent, and perhaps as likely to prove a stronger king than his brother. Necho may have fancied a resemblance between the name <span class= "ital">Yah-</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e., Jah;</span> so it was then pronounced) and <span class= "ital">Aah</span>, the name of the Egyptian moon-god. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-18.htm" title="And his wife Jehudijah bore Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.

Jeremiah had foretold the fact (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/22-10.htm" title="Weep you not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.">Jeremiah 22:10-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-37.</span> - ACCESSION AND EARLY YEARS OF JEHOIAKIM. Pharaoh-Nechoh, when he deposed Jehoahaz, at once supplied his place by another king. He had no intention of altering the governmental system of Palestine, or of ruling his conquests in any other way than through dependent monarchs. His choice fell on Josiah's eldest surviving son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>), Eliakim, who was the natural successor of his father. Eliakim, on ascending the throne, changed his name, as Jehoahaz appears to have done (see the comment on ver. 31), and reigned as Jehoiakim. For three years (B.C. 608-605) he continued a submissive vassal of the Egyptian monarch, and remitted him his tribute regularly (ver. 36). But his rule was in all respects an evil one. He "did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 37). He leant towards idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-8.htm">2 Chronicles 36:8</a>); he was oppressive and irreligious (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.' 10:5. &sect; 2); he "shed innocent blood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>); he was luxurious (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14, 15</a>), covetous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>), and tyrannical (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-6.htm">Ezekiel 19:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh-Nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father.</span> (On the general inclination of Oriental monarchs to support the hereditary principle, and to establish sons in their fathers' governments, even when the father's had been rebels or enemies, see Herod., 3:15.) <span class="cmt_word">And turned his name to Jehoiakim.</span> We may understand that Nechoh required him to take a new name, as a mark of subjection (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>; and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>), but left the choice of the name to himself. He made the change as slight as possible, merely substituting "Jehovah" for "El" as the initial element. The sense of the name remained the same, "God will set up." The idea that Nechoh was pleased with the new name on account of its apparent connection with the Egyptian moon-god, Aah (Menzel), is very fanciful. <span class="cmt_word">And took Jehoahaz away</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> carried him captive to Egypt (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-4.htm">Ezekiel 19:4</a>), a very common practice of Egyptian conquerors, and one often accompanied by extreme severities - <span class="cmt_word">and he cams to Egypt, and died there</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-12.htm">Jeremiah 22:12</a>, where this is prophesied). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:31-37 After Josiah was laid in his grave, one trouble came on another, till, in twenty-two years, Jerusalem was destroyed. The wicked perished in great numbers, the remnant were purified, and Josiah's reformation had raised up some to join the few who were the precious seed of their future church and nation. A little time, and slender abilities, often suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years, been labouring to effect. But, blessed be God, the good work which he begins by his regenerating Spirit, cannot be done away, but withstands all changes and temptations.</body></html>
