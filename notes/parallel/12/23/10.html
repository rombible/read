Simonis plausibly explained the word <span class= "ital">Hinnom</span> as meaning <span class= "ital">shrieking or moaning</span> (from the Arabic <span class= "ital">hanna</span>, arguta voce gemuit, flevit). "The valley of the sons of shrieking" would be a good name for the accursed spot.

The feminine <span class= "ital">molecheth</span>, "queen," occurs as a proper name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-18.htm" title="And his sister Hammoleketh bore Ishod, and Abiezer, and Mahalah.">1Chronicles 7:18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he defiled Topheth.</span> "To-pheth" or "Tophet" was the name given to the place in the valley of Hinnom where the sacrifices were offered to Moloch. The root of the word is thought by some to be <span class="accented">taph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e3;</span>), "a drum," because the cries of the children burnt there were drowned by the beating of drums. Others suggest as the root, <span class="accented">tuph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e3;</span>), "to spit," because the place was "spat at" by the orthodox. But Gesenius and Bottcher derive it from an Aryan root, <span class="accented">taph</span>, or tap, "to burn," whence Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, Latin <span class="accented">tepidus</span>, <span class="accented">Mod</span>. Persian <span class="accented">taftan</span>, Sanskrit tap, etc., and regard the meaning as simply "the place of burning" (see the comment on Isaiah 30:33). <span class="cmt_word">Which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom.</span> The valley of Hinnom, or of the sons of Hinnom, is generally allowed to be that which sweeps round the more western of the two hills whereon Jerusalem was built, in a direction at first south and then east, uniting itself with the Kidron valley a little to the south of Ophel. The origin of the name is uncertain; but it is most likely that the Beni-Hinnom were a tribe of Canaanites, settled on this side of Jerusalem in the time of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>). The "valley" is a ravine, deep and narrow, with steep, rocky sides. When the Moloch-worship first began in it we cannot say; but it was probably before the time of Solomon, who built a high place for Moloch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11</a>), on one of the heights by which the valley is enclosed. (On the horrible profanations of the Moloch-worship, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>.) After the Captivity, the valley of Hinnom - Ge-Hinnom - was reckoned an accursed and abominable place, a sort of earthly counterpart of the place of final punishment, which. thence derived its name of "Geheuna" (<span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>); (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22, 29</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Moloch</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 16:3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:4-14 What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem! One would not have believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel, where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history, and the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness or goodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spirit of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
