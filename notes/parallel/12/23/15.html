see below. Grammatically, "the high place" may be in apposition to "the altar," and may include it, as being a more general term.<p><span class= "bld">Which Jeroboam the son of Nebat . . .</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm" title="Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">1Kings 12:28</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Burned the high place.</span>--Was it, then, a wooden structure, as Thenius supposes? Perhaps it resembled a dolmen (many hundred such have been found in Palestine); and fire may have been kindled under it, by way of cracking the huge slabs of stone of which it was built. The fragments might then be more easily crushed.<p><span class= "bld">Burned the grove.</span>--The present text is, <span class= "ital">burned an ash</span>?<span class= "ital">rah</span>. Perhaps the article has fallen out; especially as this is not the only indication that the text has suffered in this place. Thenius understands the word in the general sense of an <span class= "ital">idol-image</span>, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm" title="However, every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelled.">2Kings 17:29</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>. But it is doubtful whether the word <span class= "ital">Ash</span>?<span class= "ital">rah</span> is so used. It is noteworthy that the present passage indirectly agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm" title="It shall be also carried to Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.">Hosea 10:6</a>, for no mention is made of what used to be the chief object of worship at Beth-el; viz., the golden bullock. It had been carried away to Assyria, as the prophet foretold.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the altar that was at Bethel</span>, <span class="accented">the high place</span>, without any "and." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is in apposition with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>. By setting up an altar at Bethel, Jeroboam constituted Bethel a "high place." <span class="cmt_word">Which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-33.htm">1 Kings 12:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), <span class="cmt_word">both that altar end the high place he brake down</span>. "The high place" is here equivalent to the "house of high places" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>, and designates "the buildings of this sanctuary" (Keil). At such a national center as Bethel a temple would, of course, accompany the altar. Whether the temple and altar were in use or not at the time when Josiah destroyed them, is uncertain. The mixed race which had superseded the Israelites in the country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24-41</a>) may have continued the worship, or may have set it aside. <span class="cmt_word">And burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder</span>. It is not clear that this latter clause applies to the high place. Perhaps we should translate - <span class="accented">And stamped small to powder</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and burned, the grove.</span> It is for the most part only comparatively small objects that are "stamped small to powder" (see vers. 6, 12, and comp. 2 Chronicles 15:21). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-24 Josiah's zeal extended to the cities of Israel within his reach. He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.</body></html>
