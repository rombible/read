Only occurring besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm" title="I will also stretch out my hand on Judah, and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;">Zephaniah 1:4</a>. Here, as in the passage of Hosea, the word denotes the unlawful priests of Jehovah, as contrasted with those of the Baal, mentioned in the next place. Whether the term really means <span class= "ital">black-robed</span>, as Kimchi explains, is questionable. Priests used to wear <span class= "ital">white</span> throughout the ancient world, except on certain special occasions. Gesenius derives it from a root meaning <span class= "ital">black</span>, but explains, <span class= "ital">one clad in black, i.e., a mourner, an ascetic</span>, and so a <span class= "ital">priest</span>. Perhaps the true derivation is from another root, meaning to <span class= "ital">weave: weaver of spells</span> or <span class= "ital">charms</span>; as magic was an invariable concomitant of false worship. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-17.htm" title="And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Kings 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm" title="And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Kings 21:6</a>.) It is a regular word for priest in Syriac (ch-mra; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>; and the Ep. to the Heb., <span class= "ital">passim</span>.)<p><span class= "bld">To burn incense.</span>--So Syriac, Vulg., and Arabic. The Hebrew <span class= "ital">has, and he burnt incense</span>. Probably it should be plural, as in the Vatican LXX. and Targum.<p><span class= "bld">In the places round about.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm" title="And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.">1Kings 6:29</a>. Omit <span class= "ital">in the places</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Unto Baal, to the sun.</span>--<span class= "ital">Unto the Baal, to wit, unto the sun</span>. But it is better to supply <span class= "ital">and</span> with all the versions. <span class= "ital">Bel and Samas</span> were distinct deities in the Assyro-Babylonian system. When Reuss remarks that "the knowledge of the old Semitic worships, possessed by the Hebrew historians, appears to have been very superficial, for Baal and the sun are one and the same deity," he lays himself open to the same charge.<p><span class= "bld">The planets.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">the signs of the Zodiac</span>. The Heb. is <span class= "ital">mazzaloth</span>, probably a variant form of <span class= "ital">mazzaroth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm" title="Can you bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or can you guide Arcturus with his sons?">Job 38:32</a>). The word is used in the Targums, and by rabbinical writers, in the sense of star, as <span class= "ital">influencing human destiny</span>, and so fate, <span class= "ital">fortune</span>, in the singular, and in the plural of the signs of the Zodiac (<span class= "ital">e.g</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm" title="This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm" title="In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.">Esther 3:7</a>). It is, perhaps, derived from '<span class= "ital">azar</span>, "to gird," and means "belt," or "girdle;" or from '<span class= "ital">azal</span>, "to journey," and so means "stages" of the sun's course in the heavens. (Comp. Arab, <span class= "ital">manzal</span>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he put down the idolatrous priests</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the chemarim</span>. The same word is used of idolatrous priests in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>. It is best connected with the Arabic root <span class="accented">chamar</span>, <span class="accented">colere deum</span>, and with the Syriac <span class="accented">cumro</span>, "priest" or "sacrificer." The Syrian priests were probably so called at the time, and the Hebrews took the word, and applied it to all false priests or idolatrous priests, reserving their <span class="accented">own cohanim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) for true Jehovistic priests only. <span class="cmt_word">Whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem.</span> This practice had not been mentioned previously, and can scarcely have belonged to the earlier kingdom of Judah, when "<span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">people"</span> (as we are told so often) "worshipped and burnt incense in the high places." But it is quite in harmony with the other doings of Manasseh and Amen, that, when they re-established the high places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3, 21</a>), they should have followed the custom of the Israelite monarchs at Dan and Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-32</a>), and have "ordained priests" to conduct the worship at them. <span class="cmt_word">Them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon</span> (on the Baal-worship of Manasseh and Amen, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; on the sun-worship, compare below, ver. 11; the moon-worship was probably a form of the worship of Astarte), <span class="cmt_word">and to the planets</span>; rather, to the twelve signs. The constellations or signs of the zodiac are, no doubt, intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>, where the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> may be regarded as a mere variant form of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> of this passage). The proper meaning of the term is "mansions;" or "houses," the zodiacal signs being regarded as the "mansions of the sun" by the Babylonians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 419). <span class="cmt_word">And to all the host of heaven</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 21:3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:4-14 What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem! One would not have believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel, where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history, and the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness or goodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spirit of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
