In Chronicles it occupies nineteen verses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. We learn from Chronicles that all the rites prescribed by the Law, whether in Exodus, Leviticus, or Deuteronomy, were duly observed, and that the festival was attended, not only by the Judaeans, but by many Israelites from among the ten tribes, who still remained intermixed with the Assyrian colonists in the Samaritan country (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-17.htm">2 Chronicles 35:17, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.</span> The ordinances for the due observance of the Passover feast are contained chiefly in Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5-10</a>). They are repeated, but with much less fullness, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-8</a>. The "book of the covenant" found by Hilkiah must, therefore, certainly have contained Exodus (see below, ver. 25). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-24 Josiah's zeal extended to the cities of Israel within his reach. He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.</body></html>
