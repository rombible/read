It may have been erected on the flat roof of one of the gates, or on the top of a store-chamber. Altars upon roofs were a new form of idolatry, apparently connected with the worship of the "host of heaven" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which the kings of Judah</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Manasseh and Amen, perhaps also Ahaz - <span class="cmt_word">had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord</span> (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4, 5</a>). As Manasseh, on his repentance, merely "cast these altars out of the city" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-15.htm">2 Chronicles 33:15</a>), it was easy for Amen to replace them. They belonged to the worship of the "host of heaven." <span class="cmt_word">Did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and east the dust of them into the brook Kidron</span> (comp. ver. 6, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:4-14 What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem! One would not have believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel, where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history, and the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness or goodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spirit of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
