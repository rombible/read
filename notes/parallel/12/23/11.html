them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2Kings 23:5</a>). Here, as there, the Syriac and Arabic render, "he killed," which is possibly a correct gloss.<p><span class= "bld">The horses . . . the sun.</span>--These horses drew "the chariots of the sun" in solemn processions held in honour of that deity. (See Herod, i. 189; Xenoph. <span class= "ital">Anab. iv.</span> 5. 34, <span class= "ital">seq</span>.; Quint. Curt. iii 3. 11.) Horses were also sacrificed to the sun. The sun's apparent course through the heavens, poetically conceived as the progress of a fiery chariot and steeds, explains these usages.<p><span class= "bld">Had given</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., had dedicated</span>.<p><span class= "bld">At the entering in of the house of the Lord.</span>--This appears right. Along with the next clause it states where the sacred horses were kept; viz., in the outer court of the Temple, near the entrance. (So the LXX. and Vulgate. This rendering involves a different pointing of the Hebrew text--<span class= "ital">m</span>?<span class= "ital">bo</span> for mibbo. The latter, which is the ordinary reading, gives the sense, "<span class= "ital">so that they should not come into the house</span>, &c.")<p><span class= "bld">By the chamber.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">towards the cell</span>; further defining the position of the stalls. As to the cells in the outer court, see the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.">1Chronicles 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-45.htm" title="And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.">Ezekiel 40:45</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Nathan-melech the chamberiain</span>, or, <span class= "ital">eunuch</span>, is otherwise unknown.

The treatment of the chariots is thus contrasted with that of the horses. If the whole had been, as some expositors have thought, a work of art in bronze or other material, placed over the gateway, no such difference would have been made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun.</span> The custom of dedicating horses to the sun was practiced by many ancient nations; but it is only in Persia that we find horses <span class="accented">and chariots so</span> dedicated (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:3. &sect; 12). The idea of the sun-god as a charioteer, who drove his horses daily across the sky, is one common to several of the Aryan nations, as the Greeks, the Romans, the Hindoos, and others;but we do not find it either in Egypt or among the Semitic peoples. The sacrifice of the horse to the sun was more general (Herod., 1:216; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:3. &sect; 24; 'Anab.,' 4:5. &sect; 35; Rig Veda, vol. 2. pp. 112, <span class="accented">et seqq</span>., etc.), but does not seem to have been adopted by the Hebrews. It is not at all clear whence the "kings of Judah" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Ahaz, Manasseh, and Amon - derived the idea of maintaining sacred chariots and horses to be used in their sun-worship. They certainly could not have received it, as Keil thinks, "through the Assyrians." <span class="cmt_word">At the entering in of the house of the Lord</span> - the horses, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, were kept near one of the entrances to the temple, to be ready for use in sacred processions - <span class="cmt_word">by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs.</span> There were many "chambers" attached to the temple, which were sometimes used as store-rooms for different materials (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5</a>), sometimes as residences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-7.htm">Nehemiah 13:7</a>). In Josiah's time, "Nathan-melech the chamberlain," or rather "the <span class="accented">eunuch</span>," <span class="accented">o</span>ccupied one of these. It was situated <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - "in the outskirts" or "purlieus" of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">And burned the chariots of the sun with fire</span> (comp. vers. 4, 6, 15, etc.). Josiah burnt all the material objects that had been desecrated by the idolatries; the persons and animals so desecrated he "removed," or deprived of their functions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:4-14 What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem! One would not have believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel, where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history, and the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness or goodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spirit of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
