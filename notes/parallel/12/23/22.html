No passover, from the time of the Judges onward had been celebrated in such strict conformity to the prescriptions of the Law. The LXX. omits the particle of comparison: <span class= "greekheb">??? ??? ??????? ?? ????? ?????</span>. On the ground of this difference, and the one mentioned in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-21.htm" title="And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.">2Kings 23:21</a>, Thenius thinks it not improbable that the text of Kings has been altered to bring into harmony with the account in Chronicles about the restoration of the feast of the passover by <span class= "ital">Hezekiah</span>--a weighty inference from such slight data. The chronicler repeats this very verse at the close of his narrative of Josiah's passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm" title="And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 35:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely there was not holden such a Passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah. </span> <span class="accented">Such</span> a Passover, one so numerously attended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>). and so exactly kept according to every ordinance of the Law of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-6.htm">2 Chronicles 35:6</a>), had not been celebrated during all the period of the judges, from Joshua to Samuel, nor under the kings of all Israel, Saul, David, and Solomon, nor under those of the separated kingdom of Judah, from Rehoboam to this year (the eighteenth) of Josiah. It is an extraordinary perversity which concludes (as do De Wette and Thenius), from this comparison of the present with former Passovers under the judges and the kings, that there had been no such former Passovers at all! Two, at any rate, are recorded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-13.htm">2 Chronicles 30:13-26</a>). Ewald has the good sense to express his dissent from this view, and to declare the meaning of the writer to be simply that "since the time of the judges there had never been such a celebration of the Passover, in such strict accordance, that is, with the prescriptions of a sacred book as that which now took place" (see his 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 239, Eng. trans.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-24 Josiah's zeal extended to the cities of Israel within his reach. He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.</body></html>
