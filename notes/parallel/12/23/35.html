He had to pay for his elevation. The raising of the fine of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.">2Kings 23:33</a> is described in this verse.<p><span class= "bld">But he taxed . . .</span>--The king kept his pledge to Pharaoh, but not out of his own means. He exacted the money from "the people of the land," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the people of all classes, levying a fixed contribution even upon the poorest of his subjects. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-14.htm" title="And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.">2Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm" title="And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.">2Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-24.htm" title="And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.">2Kings 21:24</a>, Thenius insists that "the people of the land" <span class= "ital">are the national militia</span>, and he renders: "he exacted the silver and the gold, <span class= "ital">along with</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, by the help of) <span class= "ital">the people of the land</span>." But this is, to say the least, very questionable. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-14.htm" title="And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.">2Kings 11:14</a>.)<p>(36) <span class= "bld">He reigned eleven years.</span>--Not eleven full years. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;">Jeremiah 25:1</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm" title="And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.">2Kings 24:12</a>; and Jeremiah 3 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm" title="And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:">2Kings 25:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">His mother's name was Zebudah.</span>--So the Hebrew margin and Targum. Hebrew text, Syriac, Vulg., Arabic, <span class= "ital">Zebidah. Zebadiah</span> may have been the real name. The mother of Jehoahaz was Hamutal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm" title="Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.">2Kings 23:31</a>). Thus Josiah had at least two wives, and probably more. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm" title="And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.">2Kings 24:15</a>.) He could not have been over fourteen when he begot Jehoiakim.<p><span class= "bld">Rumah.</span>--Perhaps Arumah, near Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-41.htm" title="And Abimelech dwelled at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.">Judges 9:41</a>), as Josephus has <span class= "ital">Abumah</span>. This is interesting as a slight indication that Josiah's power extended over the territory of the former kingdom of Samaria.<p>(37) <span class= "bld">He did that which was evil . . .</span>--Jeremiah represents him as luxurious, covetous, and violent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.). He murdered Urijah a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-20.htm" title="And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.">Jeremiah 26:20</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.). Ewald thinks that he introduced Egyptian animal-worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-7.htm" title="And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.">Ezekiel 8:7</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.), which is rendered highly probable by his relation of dependence on Necho. (Comp. the introduction of Assyrian star-worship under Ahaz.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh.</span> Jehoiakim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, paid the tribute, which Nechoh had fixed (ver. 33), regularly.

The wicked perished in great numbers, the remnant were purified, and Josiah's reformation had raised up some to join the few who were the precious seed of their future church and nation. A little time, and slender abilities, often suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years, been labouring to effect. But, blessed be God, the good work which he begins by his regenerating Spirit, cannot be done away, but withstands all changes and temptations.</body></html>
