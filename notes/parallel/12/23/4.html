The reformation of religion by Josiah next engages the writer's attention, and is treated, not chronologically, but rather gee-graphically, under the three heads of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> reforms in Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> reforms outside Jerusalem, but in the kingdom of Judah; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> reforms in the territory which had belonged to the kingdom of Samaria (vers. 4-20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The celebration of the Passover is then briefly noticed (vers. 21-25); and the section concludes with a eulogy of Josiah (vers. 24, 25), who, however, it is noticed could not, with all his piety, obtain a revocation of the sentence passed on Judah in consequence of the sins of Manasseh. The fate of Judah was fixed (vers. 26, 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order.</span> Not the "deputy-high priests," of whom there seems to have been only one at this period of the history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>); nor the "heads of the courses," who were not recognized as a distinct class of priests till much later; but merely the common priests, as distinguished from the high priest. (So Keil, Bahr, and others.) <span class="cmt_word">And the keepers of the door</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the keepers of the threshold</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Levites, whose duty it was to keep watch and ward at the outer temple gates (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-13.htm">1 Chronicles 26:13-18</a>). Their importance at this time appears again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal.</span> The reformation naturally began with the purging of the temple. So the reformation under Jehoiada (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>) and that of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-15.htm">2 Chronicles 33:15</a>). Under "the vessels" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) would be included the entire paraphernalia of worship, even the two altars which had been set up in honor of Baal in the outer and the inner courts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And for the grove</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and for all the host of heaven.</span> The three worships are here united, because there was a close connection between them. Baal was, in one of his aspects, the sun; and Astarte, the goddess of the "grove" wet-ship, was, in one of her aspects, the moon. The cult of "the host of heaven," though, perhaps, derived from a different source, naturally became associated with the cults of the sun and moon. <span class="cmt_word">And he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron.</span> The Law required that idols should be burnt with fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>), and likewise "groves" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>). It was enough to "overthrow" altars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>) and to "break" pillars. But Josiah seems to have thought it best to destroy by fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the completest possible way, all the objects, of whatever kind, which had been connected with the idol-worship (see vers. 6, 12, 15, 16). The burning took place in "the fields of Kidron," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the upper part of the Kidron valley, to the northeast of Jerusalem, in order that not even the smoke should pollute the town (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.</span> This was a very unusual precaution, and shows Josiah's extreme scrupulousness. He would not have even the ashes of the wooden objects, or the calcined powder of the metal ones, remain even in the vicinity of the holy city, but transported them to a distance. In selecting Bethel as the place to convey them to, he was no doubt actuated by the circumstance that that village was in some sense the fount and origin of all the religious impurities which had overflowed the land. That which had proceeded from Bethel might well be taken back thither. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:4-14 What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem! One would not have believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel, where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history, and the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness or goodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spirit of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
