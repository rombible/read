Josiah "went up" to the temple from the royal palace, which was on a lower level (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him.</span> Not only the "elders," who had been summoned, but of the people, as many as chose to attend, besides. The gathering was no doubt great; but the expressions used are (as with the Orientals generally) hyperbolical. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests, and the prophets.</span> The representation would have been incomplete without these two classes - the priests, the ordinary and regular readers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11</a>) and teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>) of the Law; and the prophets, the extraordinary and occasional teachers, inspired from time to time, and commissioned to enforce the Law, and futile to declare God's will to the people. <span class="cmt_word">And all the people, both small and great</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. without distinction of classes - all ranks of the people, high and low, rich and poor, noble and base-born. All were concerned, nay, concerned equally, in a matter which touched the national life and the prospects of each individual. <span class="cmt_word">And he read in their ears.</span> There is no reason for translating, with Keil, "he caused to be read in their ears," as though either the Jewish kings could not read, or would be usurping the functions of the priests in publicly reading the Law to the people. If a king might, like Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22-61</a>), lead the prayers of the congregation of Israel in the temple, much more might he read the Law to them. The readers in the Jewish synagogues are ordinarily lay people. <span class="cmt_word">All the words of the book of the covenant.</span> Perhaps there is here some exaggeration, as in the phrases, "<span class="accented">all</span> the men of Judah," and "<span class="accented">all</span> the inhabitants of Jerusalem." The entire Pentateuch could scarcely be read through in less than ten hours. Possibly, the Book of Deuteronomy was alone read. <span class="cmt_word">Which was found in the house of the Lord</span> (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-3 Josiah had received a message from God, that there was no preventing the ruin of Jerusalem, but that he should only deliver his own soul; yet he does his duty, and leaves the event to God. He engaged the people in the most solemn manner to abolish idolatry, and to serve God in righteousness and true holiness. Though most were formal or hypocritical herein, yet much outward wickedness would be prevented, and they were accountable to God for their own conduct.</body></html>
