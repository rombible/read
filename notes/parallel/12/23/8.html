But this assumption of <span class= "ital">two</span> localities is very precarious. The Authorised Version appears to be correct (a similar repetition of the relative referring to the same antecedent occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2Kings 23:13</a>). Joshua is an unknown personage, and it is not clear whether "the gate of Joshua" was a gate of the city named after him, or the great gate of his residence; nor is it certain that "the gate of the city" was that now called the Jaffa Gate. It is possible that the governor's residence lay near the principal gate of the city, on the left as one entered. Several "high places" stood in the open space in front of it, between it and the city gate. These would naturally be called "the high places of the gates."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah.</span> Here the writer diverges from his proper subject - the reforms in and near Jerusalem - to speak of changes which were made in other parts of Judaea. The Levitical priests, who in various cities of Judah had conducted the worship at the high places, were summoned to Jerusalem by Josiah, and forced to remain there, that the unauthorized worship which they had conducted might be brought to an end. <span class="cmt_word">And defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense.</span> Hezekiah had "removed the high places, and broken the images, and cut down the groves" throughout his dominions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), but he had not in any way "defiled the high places;" and therefore no sooner did a king take a different view of his duties than the worship was at once restored (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), and flourished as before. Josiah conceived the idea that, if the high places were "defiled," it would be impossible to renew the worship at them. <span class="cmt_word">From Geba to Beersheba.</span> Geba takes here the place of Bethel as the northern limit of Judah. It was situated at a very short distance from Bethel, and was made to supersede it on account of the idolatries by which Bethel had been disgraced. The exact site is probably the modern <span class="accented">Jeba</span>, on the southern edge of the Wady Suweinit. <span class="cmt_word">And brake down the high places of the gates.</span> The high-place worship had, it would seem, invaded Jerusalem itself. In some of the gates of the city, which were "large open buildings for public meetings and intercourse" (Bahr), altars, or more elaborate places of worship, had been established, and an unauthorized ritual of the high-place type had been set up. That were - rather, <span class="accented">that which was - <span class="cmt_word"></span>in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city.</span> This and the succeeding clauses are limitations of the general statement concerning the "high places of the gates," and indicate that two gates only had been polluted by high-place worship, viz. "the gate of Joshua," and the gale known <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as "the city gate." Neither of these can be determinately fixed, since they are only mentioned in the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and also that which was on the left-hand side in the gate of the city</span>. (So Thenius, Keil, and Bahr.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:4-14 What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem! One would not have believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel, where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history, and the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness or goodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spirit of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
