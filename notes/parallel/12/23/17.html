Josiah's eye caught sight of a "pillar" or obelisk (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) among the tombs, or in their neighborhood, and he had the curiosity to ask what it was. <span class="cmt_word">And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulcher of the man of God, which earns from Judah</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>). The "pillar" could not have been the actual "sepulcher," but was no doubt a monument connected with it. Many of the Phoenician excavated tombs are accompanied by monuments above ground, which are very conspicuous (see Renan's 'Mission de Phenicie,' pls. 11, et <span class="accented">seq</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>).

He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.</body></html>
