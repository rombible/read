As Josiah designed a thorough reformation, it was necessary for him to put them down. <span class="cmt_word">And the images</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the teraphim</span>, which are thought to have been small images kept as household gods in many Israelite families from a very ancient date (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19-35</a>). The superstition was exceedingly persistent. We find it under the judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-14.htm">Judges 18:14</a>), under Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>), here under the later kings, and it is still mentioned after the return from the Captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>). The superstition was, apparently, Babylonian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>), and brought from Ur of the Chaldees by the family of Abraham. Besides being regarded as household gods, the teraphim were used in divination. <span class="cmt_word">And the idols, and all the abominations that were spied.</span> The "idols," <span class="accented">gillulim</span>, are probably, like the teraphim, of a private nature, figures used as amulets or talismans. Excepting in Ezekiel, the word is an uncommon one. By the "abominations that were spied" are meant secret defilements and superstitious practices in households, which needed to be searched out. (So Thenius and Bahr.) <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Judah and in Jerusalem.</span> Not, apparently, in the cities of Samaria, where such a rigid inquisition would perhaps have provoked a stubborn resistance. <span class="cmt_word">Did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the Law</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that he might establish the words of the Law</span>. Laws against such practices as Josiah now put down will be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-24 Josiah's zeal extended to the cities of Israel within his reach. He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.</body></html>
