Thenius does not go so far as this, but assumes that the proper sequel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1Kings 13:1-32</a>, has been transferred to this place. He argues that it must be an interpolation here, because (1) the "moreover" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a> (<span class= "ital">w</span>?<span class= "ital">gam</span>) corresponds to the "and . . . also" (<span class= "ital">w</span>?<span class= "ital">gam</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-19.htm" title="And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.">2Kings 23:19</a>, which does not prove much; and because (2) Josiah could not pollute the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-16.htm" title="And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them on the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.">2Kings 23:16</a>) after he had already <span class= "ital">shattered it in pieces</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a>). This reasoning is not conclusive, because it is obvious that, as is so often the case, the writer has first told in brief what was done to the altar and high place at Bethel, and then related at length an interesting incident that occurred at the time. In short, the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a> is anticipatory.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Turned himself.</span>--So that he caught sight of the tombs on the hill-side opposite--not on the hill where the high place was.<p><span class= "bld">The man of God proclaimed.</span>--Some words appear to have fallen out of the Hebrew text here, for the LXX. <span class= "ital">adds</span>, "when Jeroboam stood in the feast at the altar. And he returned and lifted up his eyes upon the grave of the man of God." (A transcriber's eye wandered from one "man of God" to the other.) Josiah <span class= "ital">returned</span>, when on the point of going away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount.</span> The Israelite sepulchers, excavated in the reeky sides of hills, are everywhere conspicuous. Those of Bethel may have been in the low hill on which the town stands, or in the sides of the Wady Suweinit, a little further to the south. His <span class="accented">accidentally</span> "<span class="accented">spying</span> the sepulchers" gave Josiah the thought of completing his desecration of Bethel by having bones brought from them and burnt upon the altar - whereby he exactly accomplished the old prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), which was not at all in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">And sent, end took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it</span> (see the comment on ver. 14), <span class="cmt_word">according to the word of the Lord which the men of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who prophesied these things</span>. The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, and the meaning is, not that Josiah acted as he did in order to fulfill the prophecy, but that in thus acting he unconsciously fulfilled it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-24 Josiah's zeal extended to the cities of Israel within his reach. He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.</body></html>
