The LXX. here has "removed him," but the other versions "bound him."<p><span class= "bld">That he might not reign.</span>--This is the reading of the Hebrew margin, some MSS., and the LXX., Vulg., and Targum. The Syriac and Arabic have, "when he reigned," which is the ordinary Hebrew text. The original text of the whole was perhaps this: "and Pharaoh-nechoh bound him at Riblah . . . and removed him from reigning in Jerusalem;" <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, he threw him into bonds, and pronounced his deposition. (Comp, the construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1Kings 15:13</a>.) Riblah (now <span class= "ital">Ribleh</span>) lay in a strong position on the Orontes, commanding the caravan route from Palestine to the Euphrates. Necho had advanced so far, after the battle of Megiddo, and taken up his quarters there, as Nebuchadnezzar did afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm" title="So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.">2Kings 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-20.htm" title="And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:">2Kings 25:20-21</a>). Josephus relates that Necho summoned Jehoahaz to his camp at Riblah. The passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-4.htm" title="The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 19:4</a>, suggests that he got the king of Judah into his power by fraud: "he was taken in their pit." It used to be supposed, on the strength of Herod, ii. 159, that Necho captured <span class= "ital">Jerusalem</span>. What Herodotus says is this: "And engaging the Syrians on foot at Magdolus, Nechoh was victorious. After the battle he took Kadytis, a great city of Syria." Kadytis has been thought to be either <span class= "ital">Hadath</span> ("the new town;" referring to the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Return), or <span class= "ital">el-Kuds</span>("the holy;" the modern Arabic title of Jerusalem), or Gaza. In reality it is Kadesh on the Orontes, one of the great Hittite capitals, and not far from Hamath.<p><span class= "bld">A talent of gold.</span>--So Chronicles. The LXX. here reads, <span class= "ital">an hundred talents of gold</span> (a transcriber's error). The Syriac and Arabic, <span class= "ital">ten talents</span>, which may be right. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.">2Kings 18:14</a>, where the proportion of silver to gold is ten to one.)<p><span class= "bld">Tribute.</span>--The Hebrew word means <span class= "ital">fine</span>. The Vulg. renders rightly, "et imposuit multum terrae."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh-Nechoh put him in bands at Riblah.</span> "Riblah," which retains its name, was situated in the Coele-Syrian plain, on the right bank of the Orontes, in lat. 34&deg; 23' N. nearly. It commanded a ford over the river (Condor, 'Heth and Moab,' p. 17), and is in the midst of a rich, corn-producing country. Hamath, to which it was regarded as belonging, is situated more than fifty miles further down the river. Riblah was well placed as a center for communication with the neighboring countries. As Dr. Robinson says ('Researches,' vol. 3. p. 545), "From this point the roads were open by Aleppo and the Euphrates to Nineveh, or by Palmyra (Tadmor) to Babylon, by the end of Lebanon and the coast to Palestine (Philistia) and Egypt, or through the, Buka'a and the Jordan valley to the center of the Holy Land." Nebuchadnezzar followed the example of Nechoh in making Ribiah his headquarters during his sieges of Tyro and Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9, 10, 26, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Hamath.</span> The "land of Hamath" was the upper part of the Coele-Syrian valley from about lat. 34&deg; to lat. 35&deg; 30' N. <span class="cmt_word">That he might not reign in Jerusalem.</span> Nechoh might naturally distrust the people's choice. He might also regard the setting up of any king at Jerusalem without his sanction as an act of contumacy on the part of a nation which had been practically conquered by the complete defeat of Josiah at Megiddo. Whether his conduct in seizing Jehoahaz after inviting him to a conference was justifiable or not may be questioned; but, in point of fact, he did but use the right of the conqueror somewhat harshly. <span class="cmt_word">And put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</span> (So Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) The tribute was a very moderate one. A century earlier Sennacherib had enacted a tribute of three hundred talents of silver, <span class="accented">and thirty</span> of gold (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>). We may conjecture that Nechoh wished to conciliate the Jews, regarding them as capable of rendering him good service in the struggle, on which he had entered, with Babylon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:31-37 After Josiah was laid in his grave, one trouble came on another, till, in twenty-two years, Jerusalem was destroyed. The wicked perished in great numbers, the remnant were purified, and Josiah's reformation had raised up some to join the few who were the precious seed of their future church and nation. A little time, and slender abilities, often suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years, been labouring to effect. But, blessed be God, the good work which he begins by his regenerating Spirit, cannot be done away, but withstands all changes and temptations.</body></html>
