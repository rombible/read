Schrader regards this as an indication that Hezekiah's illness and the embassy of Merodach-baladan belong to the time preceding Sennacherib's invasion. Thenius, however, supposes that Hezekiah simply gave all the <span class= "ital">money</span> in his treasury to Sennacherib's envoys, and stripped off the gold plating of the Temple before them that they might suppose his resources exhausted, when, in fact, he had not touched his real treasures, which were concealed in subterranean chambers. Thenius also refers to the "credible" statement of the chronicler, that presents were made to Hezekiah from all quarters after the retreat of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-23.htm" title="And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thereafter.">2Chronicles 32:23</a>).

Storehouses beyond the precincts of the palace, and beyond Jerusalem. (Comp. the phrase "in all his dominion," which alludes to the resources of Hezekiah in the country, statistics of which he might show to the envoys.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah hearkened unto them.</span> Hezekiah was dazzled by the prospect that opened upon him. It was a grand thing that his fame should have reached so far as Babylon, a still grander thing to be offered such an alliance. It must be remembered that he and his counselors were inclined from the first to meet Assyrian menace by calling in foreign aid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>). He had not yet accepted the view of Isaiah, that human aid was vain, and that the only reasonable ground of hope or confidence was, in Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And showed them all the house of his precious things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his treasury. Hezekiah did not do this in mere ostentation, though he may have had a certain pride in exhibiting his wealth. His main wish, no doubt, was to make known his resources, and show that he was a valuable ally. So Oroetes acted towards Polycrates (Herod., 3:123), and Hannibal towards the Gortynians (Com. Nep., 'Vit. Hannib.,' &sect; 9). It is to be borne in mind that Hezekiah's treasures were, in <span class="date">B.C. 712</span>, still intact, and included all that ample store which he sacrificed to save Jerusalem at the time of the first expedition of Sennacherib (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>, and comp. 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, where we find enumerated among the treasures given up, besides gold and silver, "precious carbuncles, couches of ivory, elevated thrones of ivory, skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, and weapons"). <span class="cmt_word">The silver, and the gold, and the spices.</span> Compare the description of the wealth of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). "Spices" always form an important portion of the treasure of Oriental kings (comp. Herod., 2. 97, sub fin.). <span class="cmt_word">And the precious ointment</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the precious oil -</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (compare the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). It is thought (Keil, Bahr) that the valuable balsam oil, which was obtained from the royal gardens, is intended. <span class="cmt_word">And all the house of his armor</span>; or, <span class="accented">of his vessels</span>; but arms and armor are probably intended. It would be almost as important to show that he had abundant arms in store, as that he had abundant riches. <span class="cmt_word">And all that was found in his treasures</span> - a clause implying that there was much more which had not been specified, as precious stones, ivory, ebony, and the like - <span class="cmt_word">there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.</span> This is a manifest hyperbole; but it can scarcely mean less than that he gave orders for them to be shown the collections of arms and stores which existed in his other strongholds besides Jerusalem. Hezekiah, no doubt, had many "<span class="accented">store</span> cities," as Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-6.htm">2 Chronicles 8:6</a>) and Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12</a>) had. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:12-21 The king of Babylon was at this time independent of the king of Assyria, though shortly after subdued by him. Hezekiah showed his treasures and armour, and other proofs of his wealth and power. This was the effect of pride and ostentation, and departing from simple reliance on God. He also seems to have missed the opportunity of speaking to the Chaldeans, about Him who had wrought the miracles which excited their attention, and of pointing out to them the absurdity and evil of idolatry. What is more common than to show our friends our houses and possessions? But if we do this in the pride of ours hearts, to gain applause from men, not giving praise to God, it becomes sin in us, as it did in Hezekiah. We may expect vexation from every object with which we are unduly pleased. Isaiah, who had often been Hezekiah's comforter, is now is reprover. The blessed Spirit is both, Joh 16:7,8. Ministers must be both, as there is occasion. Hezekiah allowed the justice of the sentence, and God's goodness in the respite. Yet the prospect respecting his family and nation must have given him many painful feelings. Hezekiah was indeed humbled for the pride of his heart. And blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; for they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.</body></html>
