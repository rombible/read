Hezekiah was known, not only as a pious king, and the king in whose reign the pride of the Assyrians was dashed to the ground, but also as one who, by works of great importance, conferred permanent benefit on Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3-5</a> and 30; Ecclus. 48:17). The writer feels that he cannot conclude his notice of Hezekiah's reign without some mention of these works. He enters, however, into no description, but, having referred the reader for details to the "book of the chronicles," notes in the briefest possible way the decease of Hezekiah, and the accession of his son and successor. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might.</span> Hezekiah's "might" was chiefly shown in the earlier portion of his reign, when he "smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>). Against Assyria he was unsuccessful, and must have succumbed, but for the miraculous destruction of Sennacherib's host. <span class="cmt_word">And how he made a pool</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the pool</span>, or <span class="accented">the reservoir</span>. The writer of Kings either knows of one pool only in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, or regards one as so superior that it deserves to be called <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "the pool." Recent discoveries make it highly probable that the "pool" intended is that of Siloam, or, if not the present Siloam reservoir, a larger one, a little below it, now known as <span class="accented">Birket el Hamra</span> (see the 'Quarterly Statement' of the Palestine Exploration Fund for April, 1886, p. 88). That there was at least one other pool in Hezekiah's time is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9, 11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And a conduit</span>; rather, the conduit. If "the pool" is Siloam, "the conduit" must almost certainly be that which was excavated under Ophel for the purpose of conveying the water from the Well of the Virgin in the Kedron valley to the Siloam reservoir on the western side of the spur. This conduit, which is curiously twisted, has a length of 1708 feet, with a height varying from two feet to four or five, and a width of about two feet. The roof is flat, the sides perpendicular, and the floor hollowed into a groove for the more rapid passage of the water. About nineteen feet from the southern extremity, where the channel opens upon the Siloam pool, a niche has been cut in the right-hand wall in the shape of a square tablet, and smoothed to receive an inscription of six lines, the greater part of which has been recovered. The letters are of the old Hebrew or Phoenician type, and by their forms indicate a date "between the eighth and the sixth centuries" (Sayce). The inscription, so far as it is legible, appears to have run as follows: "Behold the tunnel! Now, this is the history of the tunnel. As the excavators were lifting up the pick, each towards the other, and while there were yet three cubits to be broken through... the voice of the one called to his neighbor, for there was an excess (?) of the rock on the right. Then they rose up... they struck on the west of the excavators; the excavators struck, each to meet the other, pick to pick. And the waters flowed from their outlet to the pool for a distance of a thousand cubits; and three-fourths (?) of a cubit was the height of the rock over the head of the excavation here." We learn from it that the workmen began at either end, and tunnelled through the rock until they met in the middle - a result which their previous divergences from the straight line force us to attribute more to good fortune than to engineering science. <span class="cmt_word">And brought water into the city.</span> The Well of the Virgin was without, the Pool of Siloam within, the city - the wall of the town being carried across the Tyropoeon valley from the extreme point of Ophel to the opposite hilt (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> Hezekiah's fame rested very much upon these works, as we see by what is said of him by the son of Sirach (see the comment on vers. 20, 21). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:12-21 The king of Babylon was at this time independent of the king of Assyria, though shortly after subdued by him. Hezekiah showed his treasures and armour, and other proofs of his wealth and power. This was the effect of pride and ostentation, and departing from simple reliance on God. He also seems to have missed the opportunity of speaking to the Chaldeans, about Him who had wrought the miracles which excited their attention, and of pointing out to them the absurdity and evil of idolatry. What is more common than to show our friends our houses and possessions? But if we do this in the pride of ours hearts, to gain applause from men, not giving praise to God, it becomes sin in us, as it did in Hezekiah. We may expect vexation from every object with which we are unduly pleased. Isaiah, who had often been Hezekiah's comforter, is now is reprover. The blessed Spirit is both, Joh 16:7,8. Ministers must be both, as there is occasion. Hezekiah allowed the justice of the sentence, and God's goodness in the respite. Yet the prospect respecting his family and nation must have given him many painful feelings. Hezekiah was indeed humbled for the pride of his heart. And blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; for they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.</body></html>
