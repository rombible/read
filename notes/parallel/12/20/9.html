shall it return ten steps?</span> This is what the Hebrew text seems to say at a first glance. But Hezekiah's answer apparently implies an alternative; and we <span class= "ital">might</span> render: "the shadow shall have travelled ten steps; or shall it return ten steps?" (Comp. the LXX. <span class= "greekheb">??????????</span><span class= "ital">.</span>) The Targum has: "shall the shadow march ten hours or return ten hours?" The Vulgate also makes it a double question. The Syriac is: "the shadow shall march ten steps, or return ten steps."<p>It is very probable that the Hebrew text is corrupt. We might read the first word as an infinitive instead of a perfect, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.">2Kings 19:29</a> ("ye shall eat"). Or we might read "shall it march?" as a question (<span class= "ital">h?-y?l?k</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> or better still, "shall it go up" (<span class= "ital">h?-y?l?k</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> after the hint afforded by the Vulgate: "Vis ut <span class= "ital">ascendat</span> umbra . . . Et ait Ezeehias, Facile est umbram <span class= "ital">crescere,</span>" &c. It is obvious that a kind of sun-dial is meant, though what kind is not so clear. The word "degrees" (<span class= "ital">ma'?loth</span>) means "steps" or "stairs" wherever it occurs. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-26.htm" title="Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not discovered thereon.">Exodus 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm" title="Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.">Ezekiel 40:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm" title="And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.">Ezekiel 40:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm" title="And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on the posts thereof.">Ezekiel 40:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-31.htm" title="And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:31</a>, &c; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-20.htm" title="And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.">1Kings 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm" title="But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and to the stairs that go down from the city of David.">Nehemiah 3:15</a>.) There is probability, therefore, in Knobel's conjecture that "the dial of Ahaz" consisted of a column rising from a circular flight of steps, so as to throw the shadow of its top on the top step at noon, and morning and evening on the bottom step. This, or some similar device, was set up in the palace court, and was probably visible to Hezekiah lying on his sick bed and facing the window. Herodotus (ii. 9) ascribes the invention of the gnomon to the Babylonians. From the inscriptions we know that they divided time into periods of two hours, each called in Sumerian <span class= "ital">kasbumi,</span> and in Assyrian <span class= "ital">asli.</span> Each <span class= "ital">kasbu</span> or <span class= "ital">aslu</span> was subdivided into sixty equal parts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken.</span> Hezekiah is no more reproved for asking for a sign than was Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37, 39</a>). Ahaz, his father, had been reproved for not asking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-13.htm">Isaiah 7:13</a>). It would be faithless now for Christians to demand signs; but in an age of miracles, when there were prophets upon the earth empowered to give signs, faithful men might request them without incurring God's displeasure. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the shadow go forward ten degrees?</span> The Hebrew text will scarcely bear this translation, which, however, seems to be required by Hezekiah's answer. Perhaps for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5da;</span>. Or go back ten degrees? literally, in both clauses, <span class="accented">ten steps</span>. There are abundant reasons for believing that the early dials consisted of a gnomon set up on the top of a flight of steps, and that time was measured by the number of steps on which the shadow of the gnomon fell (see a paper by Mr. Bosanquet, in the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1874, pp. 1-82). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Hezekiah was sick unto death, in the same year in which the king of Assyria besieged Jerusalem. A warning to prepare for death was brought to Hezekiah by Isaiah. Prayer is one of the best preparations for death, because by it we fetch in strength and grace from God, to enable us to finish well. He wept sorely: some gather from hence that he was unwilling to die; it is in the nature of man to dread the separation of soul and body. There was also something peculiar in Hezekiah's case; he was now in the midst of his usefulness. Let Hezekiah's prayer, see Isa 38. interpret his tears; in that is nothing which is like his having been under that fear of death, which has bondage or torment. Hezekiah's piety made his sick-bed easy. O Lord, remember now; he does not speak as if God needed to be put in mind of any thing by us; nor, as if the reward might be demanded as due; it is Christ's righteousness only that is the purchase of mercy and grace. Hezekiah does not pray, Lord, spare me; but, Lord, remember me; whether I live or die, let me be thine. God always hears the prayers of the broken in heart, and will give health, length of days, and temporal deliverances, as much and as long as is truly good for them. Means were to be used for Hezekiah's recovery; yet, considering to what a height the disease was come, and how suddenly it was checked, the cure was miraculous. It is our duty, when sick, to use such means as are proper to help nature, else we do not trust God, but tempt him. For the confirmation of his faith, the shadow of the sun was carried back, and the light was continued longer than usual, in a miraculous manner. This work of wonder shows the power of God in heaven as well as on earth, the great notice he takes of prayer, and the great favour he bears to his chosen.</body></html>
