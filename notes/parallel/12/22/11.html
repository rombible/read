It was not, however, a wholly new thing; rather, he accepted it as the recovery of a thing that was known to have been lost, and was now happily found. And in accepting it he regarded it as authoritative. It was not to him "a book of Law" (Ewald), but "the book of <span class="accented">the</span> Law." We can well imagine that, although the book may have been lost early in Manasseh's reign, yet echoes of it had lingered on <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the liturgies of the Jehovistic worship; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the teachings of the prophets; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in the traditional teaching of religious families; so that the pious ear recognized its phrases as familiar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is also probable that there were external tokens about the book indicative of its character, which caused its ready acceptance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:11-20 The book of the law is read before the king. Those best honour their Bibles, who study them; daily feed on that bread, and walk by that light. Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this inquiry, What shall we do to be saved? Also, what we may expect, and must provide for. Those who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath, cannot but be very anxious how they may be saved. Huldah let Josiah know what judgments God had in store for Judah and Jerusalem. The generality of the people were hardened, and their hearts unhumbled, but Josiah's heart was tender. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he humbled himself before the Lord. Those who most fear God's wrath, are least likely to feel it. Though Josiah was mortally wounded in battle, yet he died in peace with God, and went to glory. Whatever such persons suffer or witness, they are gathered to the grave in peace, and shall enter into the rest which remaineth for the people of God.</body></html>
