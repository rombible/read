The freedom of expression here warns us against pressing the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm" title="And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.">2Kings 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-10.htm" title="And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.">2Kings 22:10</a> ("he read it").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jerusalem - <span class="cmt_word">and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the King of Judah hath read.</span> In the parallel passage of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-24.htm">2 Chronicles 34:24</a>) the expression used is stronger, viz, "Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even <span class="accented">all the curses</span> that are written in the book which they have road before the King of Judah." The passage which most strongly affected Josiah was probably that, already mentioned, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which began with a series of curses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:11-20 The book of the law is read before the king. Those best honour their Bibles, who study them; daily feed on that bread, and walk by that light. Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this inquiry, What shall we do to be saved? Also, what we may expect, and must provide for. Those who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath, cannot but be very anxious how they may be saved. Huldah let Josiah know what judgments God had in store for Judah and Jerusalem. The generality of the people were hardened, and their hearts unhumbled, but Josiah's heart was tender. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he humbled himself before the Lord. Those who most fear God's wrath, are least likely to feel it. Though Josiah was mortally wounded in battle, yet he died in peace with God, and went to glory. Whatever such persons suffer or witness, they are gathered to the grave in peace, and shall enter into the rest which remaineth for the people of God.</body></html>
