The son of Sirach says of Josiah, "The remembrance of Josias is like the composition of the perfume that is made by the art of the apothecary: it is sweet as honey in all mouths, and as music at a banquet of wine. He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people, and took away the abominations of iniquity. He directed his heart unto the Lord, and in the time of the ungodly he established the worship of God. <span class="accented">All</span>, <span class="accented">except David and Ezekias and Josias</span>, <span class="accented">were defective:</span> for they forsook the Law of the Most High, even the kings of Judah failed" (see Ecclus. 49:1-4). <span class="cmt_word">And turned not aside to the right hand or to the left</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he never deviated from the right path (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-6.htm">Joshua 23:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-10 The different event of Josiah's early succession from that of Manasseh, must be ascribed to the distinguishing grace of God; yet probably the persons that trained him up were instruments in producing this difference. His character was most excellent. Had the people joined in the reformation as heartily as he persevered in it, blessed effects would have followed. But they were wicked, and had become fools in idolatry. We do not obtain full knowledge of the state of Judah from the historical records, unless we refer to the writings of the prophets who lived at the time. In repairing the temple, the book of the law was found, and brought to the king. It seems, this book of the law was lost and missing; carelessly mislaid and neglected, as some throw their Bibles into corners, or maliciously concealed by some of the idolaters. God's care of the Bible plainly shows his interest in it. Whether this was the only copy in being or not, the things contained in it were new, both to the king and to the high priest. No summaries, extracts, or collections out of the Bible, can convey and preserve the knowledge of God and his will, like the Bible itself. It was no marvel that the people were so corrupt, when the book of the law was so scarce; they that corrupted them, no doubt, used arts to get that book out of their hands. The abundance of Bibles we possess aggravates our national sins; for what greater contempt of God can we show, than to refuse to read his word when put into our hands, or, reading it, not to believe and obey it? By the holy law is the knowledge of sin, and by the blessed gospel is the knowledge of salvation. When the former is understood in its strictness and excellence, the sinner begins to inquire, What must I do to be saved? And the ministers of the gospel point out to him Jesus Christ, as the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</body></html>
