But the ordinary Hebrew text, <span class= "ital">thy graves</span>, may be right, as referring to the burial-place formed by Manasseh, which would contain a number of chambers and niches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-18.htm" title="And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.">2Kings 21:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In peace.</span>--These words are limited by those which follow: "thine eyes shall not see all the evil," &c. Josiah was slain in battle, as the next chapter relates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>); but he was spared the greater calamity of witnessing the ruin of his people.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace.</span> There is a seeming contradiction between these words and the fact of Josiah's violent death in battle against Pharaoh-Nechoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). But the contradiction is not a real one. Huldah was commissioned to assure Josiah that, though the destruction of his kingdom and the desolation of Judaea and Jerusalem, threatened in the Law, were at hand, yet they would not come in his day. He would not see the evil time. Before it came he would be "gathered to his fathers" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in Jerusalem, as his predecessors had been (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>), and not hurried off into captivity, to die in a foreign land, or given "the burial of an ass, drawn and east forth before the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). The promise given him was fulfilled. He died in battle; but he was buried in peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24, 25</a>); and the fated enemy who was to destroy Jerusalem, and carry the Jewish nation into captivity, did not make any attack upon the land until three years later, when he was departed to his rest, and the throne was occupied by Jehoiakim (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place</span>; e.g. the three sieges of Nebuchadnezzar, the destruction of the temple and city by Nebuzaradan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9, 10</a>), the deportation of the bulk of the inhabitants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>), and the calamities which happened to the remnant left (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-26</a>). Josiah did not witness any of this. He was "taken away from the evil to come." <span class="cmt_word">And they brought the king word again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Hilkiah, Shaphan, and their companions (ver. 14) reported to Josiah the message which Huldah had sent by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:11-20 The book of the law is read before the king. Those best honour their Bibles, who study them; daily feed on that bread, and walk by that light. Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this inquiry, What shall we do to be saved? Also, what we may expect, and must provide for. Those who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath, cannot but be very anxious how they may be saved. Huldah let Josiah know what judgments God had in store for Judah and Jerusalem. The generality of the people were hardened, and their hearts unhumbled, but Josiah's heart was tender. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he humbled himself before the Lord. Those who most fear God's wrath, are least likely to feel it. Though Josiah was mortally wounded in battle, yet he died in peace with God, and went to glory. Whatever such persons suffer or witness, they are gathered to the grave in peace, and shall enter into the rest which remaineth for the people of God.</body></html>
