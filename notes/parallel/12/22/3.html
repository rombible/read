Josiah did not succeed, any more than Hezekiah, in rooting out the spirit of apostasy.

The young king was, no doubt influenced for good by the discourses of Jeremiah and Zephaniah; but it is not easy to account for his heeding the prophetic teachings, considering that, as the grandson of a Manasseh and the son of an Amon he must have been brought up under precisely opposite influences (<span class= "ital">Thenius</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">The king sent Shaphan . . . the scribe.</span>--Chronicles mentions beside Maaseiah, the governor of the city, and Joah the recorder.

Upon such a basis of mere conjecture, the inference is raised that the chronicler invented these names, in order "to give a colour of genuine history to his narrative." It is obvious to reply that Shaphan only is mentioned here, as the chief man in the business.

The writer of Kings, bent on abbreviating as much as possible, omits the early reforms of Josiah, which are related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3-7</a>, with perhaps some anticipation of what happened later. The young king gave marked indications of personal piety and attachment to true religion as early as the eighth year of his reign, when he was sixteen, and had just attained his majority (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 232, note). Later, in his twelfth year, he began the purging of the temple and of Jerusalem, at the same time probably commencing the repairs spoken of in ver. 9. Jeremiah's prophesying, begun in the same or in the next year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>), must have been a powerful assistance to his reformation. <span class="cmt_word">That the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the Lord, saying.</span> Shaphan held the office, which Shebna had held in the later part of Hezekiah's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>), an office of much importance and dignity. According to the author of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>), there were associated with him on this occasion two other personages of importance, viz. Maaseiah, the governor of the city (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>), and Joah the son of Joahaz, the "recorder," or "remembrancer." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-10 The different event of Josiah's early succession from that of Manasseh, must be ascribed to the distinguishing grace of God; yet probably the persons that trained him up were instruments in producing this difference. His character was most excellent. Had the people joined in the reformation as heartily as he persevered in it, blessed effects would have followed. But they were wicked, and had become fools in idolatry. We do not obtain full knowledge of the state of Judah from the historical records, unless we refer to the writings of the prophets who lived at the time. In repairing the temple, the book of the law was found, and brought to the king. It seems, this book of the law was lost and missing; carelessly mislaid and neglected, as some throw their Bibles into corners, or maliciously concealed by some of the idolaters. God's care of the Bible plainly shows his interest in it. Whether this was the only copy in being or not, the things contained in it were new, both to the king and to the high priest. No summaries, extracts, or collections out of the Bible, can convey and preserve the knowledge of God and his will, like the Bible itself. It was no marvel that the people were so corrupt, when the book of the law was so scarce; they that corrupted them, no doubt, used arts to get that book out of their hands. The abundance of Bibles we possess aggravates our national sins; for what greater contempt of God can we show, than to refuse to read his word when put into our hands, or, reading it, not to believe and obey it? By the holy law is the knowledge of sin, and by the blessed gospel is the knowledge of salvation. When the former is understood in its strictness and excellence, the sinner begins to inquire, What must I do to be saved? And the ministers of the gospel point out to him Jesus Christ, as the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</body></html>
