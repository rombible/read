Thenius thinks that this word is used to indicate that only <span class= "ital">male</span> descendants of Ahab were to be put to death (?). The Alexandrian LXX. omits <span class= "ital">sons</span>; and four Hebrew MSS. read instead <span class= "ital">house.</span> The Authorised Version, however, is a permissible interpretation of the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">Come.</span>--LXX., <span class= "ital">bring </span>(<span class= "ital">them</span>) which is a natural conjecture.<p><span class= "bld">To Jezreel.</span>--A journey of more than twenty miles.<p><span class= "bld">By to morrow this time.</span>--Jehu is urgent for despatch, because time is all-important.

According to the Masoretic punctuation, and supposing that the particle <span class= "ital">'eth</span> (rendered "with") might here be used merely to introduce the subject, we might render: "Now the king's sons were seventy persons; the great men of the city were bringing them up." But such a usage of '<span class= "ital">eth</span> is very doubtful. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-5.htm" title="But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.">2Kings 6:5</a>.) The sentence, in any case, is only a parenthetic reminder of what was stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-1.htm" title="And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,">2Kings 10:1</a>. The total seventy is, perhaps, not to be taken as exact, seventy being a favourite <span class= "ital">round</span> number. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-42.htm" title="The sons of Ezer; Bilhan, and Zavan, and Jakan. The sons of Dishan; Uz, and Aran.">1Chronicles 1:42</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">second time</span>. The reply of the Samaritan authorities gave Jehu an opportunity, of which he was not slow to take advantage. They might have been contented with their negative response, "We will not make any man king;" but they had gone beyond it - they had departed from the line of neutrality, and had placed themselves unreservedly on Jehu's side. "We are thy servants," they had said, "and will do all that thou shalt bid us." It is always rash to promise absolute obedience to a human being. To volunteer such a promise, when it is not even asked, is the height of folly. <span class="cmt_word">If ye be mine</span> - as they had said they were, when they called themselves his "slaves" - <span class="cmt_word">and if ye will hearken unto my voice</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, obey me, do as I require - <span class="cmt_word">take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel.</span> The Samaritan authorities were ordered to bring the heads with them, that they might be seen and counted. In the East generally, the heads of rebels and pretenders, by whatever death they may have died, are cut off, brought to the sovereign, and then exposed in some public place, in order that the public at large may be certified that the men are really dead (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By tomorrow this time.</span> As Jezreel was not more than about twenty miles from Samaria, the order could be executed by that time. It necessitated, however, very prompt measures, and gave the authorities but little time for consideration. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up (comp. ver. 1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-14 In the most awful events, though attended by the basest crimes of man, the truth and justice of God are to be noticed; and he never did nor can command any thing unjust or unreasonable. Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness from that which is the cause of all misery?</body></html>
