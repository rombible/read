Thenius, however, suggests that the verb "escapeth" should be pointed as a <span class= "ital">transitive</span> form (<span class= "ital">pihel</span> instead of <span class= "ital">niphal</span>). This gives: "The man that letteth escape any of the men," &c., an improvement that may be right, although the old versions agree with the present Hebrew pointing of the word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they went in</span> - rather, <span class="accented">when they had gone in</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when the whole multitude of Baal-worshippers, priests and people, had entered within the precincts of the temple - <span class="cmt_word">to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.</span> The priests officiate, but the offerings are regarded as conjointly made by priest and people. <span class="cmt_word">Jehu appointed four score men without.</span> Josephus says ('Ant.

Gaolers were commonly put to death if a prisoner committed to their charge escaped them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-19.htm">Acts 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-27.htm">Acts 16:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-28 Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of our hearts.</body></html>
