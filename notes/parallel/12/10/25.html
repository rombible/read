This is probably right. (Comp. the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-24.htm" title="And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.">2Kings 10:24</a>). We can hardly suppose with Ewald that Jehu personally offered sacrifices in the character of an ardent Baal-worshipper. For the massacre Jehu chose the moment when all the assembly was absorbed in worship.<p><span class= "bld">To the guard and to the captains.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to the runners</span> (or <span class= "ital">couriers</span>) <span class= "ital">and to the adjutants</span> (or <span class= "ital">squires</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm" title="But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no slaves: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.">1Kings 9:22</a>.) The royal guardsmen and their officers are meant.<p><span class= "bld">Cast them out.</span>--That is, threw the dead bodies out of the temple. This is the explanation of the Targum and the other versions. Thenius asks why this should be specially mentioned, and proposes to understand the verb intransitively, "rushed out," which suits very well with what follows.<p><span class= "bld">And went to the city of the house of Baal</span>.--The word <span class= "ital">city</span> has here its original meaning, which is also that of the Greek <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>--viz., <span class= "ital">citadel, stronghold</span>; properly, a place surrounded by a ring-fence or rampart. Jehu's guards, after the completion of their bloody work in the court of the temple, rushed up the steps into the sanctuary itself, which, like the temple of Solomon, resembled a fortress. ("Ex atrio irruperunt satellites Jehu in ipsam arcem templi."--Sebastian Schmidt.) Gesenius explains the word as meaning the <span class= "ital">temenos</span> or sacred enclosure of the temple, but that does not suit the context. (The origin of the word '<span class= "ital">ir</span>, "city," obscure in Hebrew, is revealed by the cuneiform inscriptions in the Accadian word <span class= "ital">erim</span> or <span class= "ital">eri</span>, meaning "foundation," and <span class= "ital">Uru</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Ur, a proper name, meaning "the city.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering.</span> It has been concluded from this that Jehu" offered the sacrifices <span class="accented">with his own hand</span>, as though he were the most zealous of Baal's adorers" (Ewald, ' History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 100); but the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the expression used. The suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span> may be used indefinitely, "when one finished," or "when they finished;" or Jehu may be said to have made the offerings, because he famished the victims, not because he immolated them with his own hand. Throughout heathendom, wherever there wore priests, it was the duty of the prints to slay the victims offered. <span class="cmt_word">That Jehu said to the guard</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to the</span> runners (see the comment on 1 Kings 1:38) - <span class="cmt_word">and to the captains</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the officers in command of the guard - <span class="cmt_word">Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.</span> We must suppose that some guarded the doors, while others advanced into the crowd and struck right and left. The unarmed multitude seems to have made no resistance. <span class="cmt_word">And they smote them with the edge of the sword</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cut them down unsparingly, smote and slew till none were left alive - <span class="cmt_word">and the guard and the captains cast them out.</span> This is generally understood to mean that all the bodies were thrown by the guards out of the temple. Dean Stanley says, "The temple was strewn with corpses, which, "as fast as they fell, the guard and the officers threw out with their own hands" ('Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 188). But it is not apparent why they should have taken this trouble. Perhaps Bahr is right in suggesting that no more is meant than that the guard and the officers thrust the bodies out of their way, as they pressed forward to enter the sanctuary which contained the sacred images. <span class="cmt_word">And went to the city of the house of Baal.</span> "They made their way," as Ewald says, "into the inner sanctuary, the enclosure of which rose like a lofty fortress - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> originally meant "fortress" - where Baal was enthroned, surrounded by the images of his fellow-gods" ('History of Israel,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.). It is to be remembered that the assembled multitude occupied the court or courts of the temple, within which, in a commanding position, was the "house" or "sanctuary" - perhaps reserved for the priests only. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-28 Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of our hearts.</body></html>
