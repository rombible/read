and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm" title="And the families of the scribes which dwelled at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.">1Chronicles 2:55</a>. Ewald supposes that the Rechabites were one of the new societies formed after the departure of Elijah for the active support of the true religion. Their founder in this sense was Jonadab, who, despairing of being able to practise the legitimate worship in the bosom of the community, retired into the desert with his followers, and, like Israel of old, preferred the rough life of tents to all the allurements of city life. Only unusual circumstances could induce them (like their founder, in the present instance) to re-enter the circle of common life. "The son of Rechab" means <span class= "ital">the Rechabite</span>.<p><span class= "bld">And he saluted him.</span>--It was important to Jehu to be seen acting in concert with a man revered for sanctity, and powerful as a leader of the orthodox party.<p><span class= "bld">Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</span>--The Hebrew is: <span class= "ital">Is there with thy heart right </span>(<span class= "ital">sincerity</span>)? but this does not agree with the rest of the question. Some MSS. omit the particle <span class= "ital">'eth</span> ("with"); but the original reading is probably preserved in the Vatican LXX: "Is thy heart right [<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, sincere, honest] with my heart, as my heart with thy heart?" This secures a parallelism of expression. (Syriac: "Is there in thy heart sincerity, like that of my heart with thy heart?")<p><span class= "bld">If it be.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">An it be</span> (the old English idiom, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, <span class= "ital">and it be</span>). Jehu makes this reply. The LXX. (Alex.) has: "And Jehu said;" Vulg., <span class= "ital">saith he;</span> Syriac, "It is, and it is; and he said to him" (perhaps an accidental transposition).<p><span class= "bld">Give me thine hand.</span>--As a pledge of good faith and token of amity. Striking hands sealed a compact. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>; and Cheyne's Note.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> <span class="accented">- Jehonadab the son of Rechab associated by Jehu in his acts</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab.</span> Between Beth-Eked and Samaria Jehu fell in with the great Kenite chief, Jehonadab, the founder of the remarkable tribe and sect of the Rechabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6-19</a>). Jehonadab is mentioned only here and in the passage of Jeremiah just quoted; but it is evident that he was an important personage. His tribe, the Kenites, was probably of Arab origin, and certainly of Arab habits. It attached itself to the Israelites during their wanderings in the Sinaitic desert, and was given a settlement in "the wilderness of Judah," on the conquest of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>). Jehonadab seems to have been of an ascetic turn, and to have laid down for his tribe a rule of life stricter and more severe than any known previously. He required them not merely to dwell in tents, and, unless under the compulsion of war, never to enter cities, but also to abstain wholly from the use of wine, and to have neither house, nor field, nor vineyard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Jeremiah 35:8-10</a>). Gautama, between three and four centuries later, enjoined a somewhat similar rule upon his disciples. It is indicative of much strength of character in either case, that so strict a rule was accepted, adopted, and acted upon for centuries. On the present occasion, Jehu, it would seem, desired the sanction of Jehonadab to the proceedings upon which he was about to enter, as calculated to legitimate them in the eyes of some who might otherwise have regarded them with disapproval. Jehonadab had, no doubt, the influence which is always wielded by an ascetic in Oriental countries. <span class="cmt_word">Coming to meet him.</span> This expression tells us nothing of Jehonadab's intent. The meeting may have been merely a chance one. <span class="cmt_word">And he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</span> literally, <span class="accented">he blessed him</span>; but the word used (<span class="accented">barak</span>) has frequently the sense of "to salute" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-10.htm">1 Samuel 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-14.htm">1 Samuel 25:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>, etc.). Jehu's inquiry was made to assure himself of Jehonadab's sympathy, on which no doubt he counted, but whereof he was glad to receive a positive promise. Jehonadab must have been known as a zealous servant of Jehovah, and might therefore be assumed to be hostile to the house of Ahab. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehonadab answered, It is.</span> Unhesitatingly, without a moment's pause, without the shadow of a doubt, the Kenite chief cast in his lot with the revolutionist. Heart and soul he would join him in an anti-Ahab policy. <span class="cmt_word">If it he, Give me thine hand.</span> The Hebrews did not clench agreements, like the Greeks and Romans, by grasping each other's hands. Jehu merely means to say, "If this is so, if thou art heart and. soul with me in the matter, put out thy hand, and I will take thee into my chariot." Jehu intended at once to do honor to the Kenite chief, and to strengthen his own position by being seen to be so familiar with him. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehonadab - <span class="cmt_word">gave him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehu - <span class="cmt_word">his hand</span>; <span class="cmt_word">and he took him up to him into the chariot.</span> There was always room in a chariot for at least three or four persons - the charioteer and the owner of the chariot in front, and one or two guards behind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-28 Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of our hearts.</body></html>
