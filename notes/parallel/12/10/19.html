The Egyptians called the priest <span class="accented">ab</span>, the prophet <span class="accented">neter hen</span>, literally, "servant of <span class="accented">God</span>." They held the priest in the greater honor. In Phoenicia, on the contrary, judging from the scanty notices that we possess, prophets appear to have taken precedence of priests, and to have had the more important functions assigned to them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let none be wanting</span> - literally, <span class="accented">let not a man fail - <span class="cmt_word"></span>for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal.</span> Like the other gods of the heathen, Baal and Ashtoreth were worshipped chiefly by sacrifice. The sacrifice was sometimes human, but more Commonly a sacrificial animal, such as a bull, a ram, or a he-goat. In the greater festivals several hundreds of victims were offered; and their flesh was served up at the banquets by which the festivals were accompanied. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.</span> His absence would be regarded as an act of contumacy verging on rebellion, and so as deserving of capital punishment. <span class="cmt_word">But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</span> "Subtilty" was characteristic of John, who always preferred to gain his ends by cunning rather than in a straightforward way. Idolaters were by the Law liable to death, and Jehu would have had a perfect right to crush the Baal-worship throughout the land, by sending his emissaries everywhere, with orders to slay all whom they found engaged in it. But to draw some thousands of his subjects by false pretences into a trap, and then to kill them in it for doing what he had himself invited them to do, was an act that was wholly unjustifiable, and that savored, not of the wisdom which is from above, but of that bastard wisdom which is "earthly, sensual, devilish" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>). Jehu's religious reformation did not succeed, and it was conducted in such a way that it did not deserve to succeed. A little more honest boldness, and a little less frequent resort to subterfuge and craft, might have had a different result, and have been better both for himself and for his people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-28 Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of our hearts.</body></html>
