Encouraged by his past success, having killed Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Jezebel, having secured the adhesion of the chief men in Samaria, and effected the destruction of all those who might naturally have claimed the succession and involved him in civil war, Jehu proceeded to greater lengths. He "slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel" - the princesses probably, as well as the princes - and further put to death all the leading partisans of the dethroned dynasty, the "great men," perhaps even those who had worked his bloody will at Samaria, and the intimate friends and supporters of the house - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, as they are here called - not relatives, but "intimate acquaintances." <span class="cmt_word">And his priests.</span> This expression causes a difficulty, since the destruction of the Baal-priests is related subsequently (vers. 19-25). It has been suggested to understand by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, not" priests," but "high state officers" (Bahr) - a meaning which the word is thought to have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>. But this signification of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is scarcely an ascertained one. Perhaps the same persons are intended as in ver. 19, the present notice of their death being a mere summary, and the narrative of vers. 19-25 a full statement of the circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">Until he left him none remaining</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> until the entire Ahabite faction was blotted out. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-14 In the most awful events, though attended by the basest crimes of man, the truth and justice of God are to be noticed; and he never did nor can command any thing unjust or unreasonable. Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness from that which is the cause of all misery?</body></html>
