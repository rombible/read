The Targum has chests (<span class= "ital">qumtrayy</span>a<span class= "ital">--i.e</span>., <span class= "greekheb">????????</span>, "caskets"; comp. Latin, <span class= "ital">capsa</span>). The LXX. does not translate the word.<p>The Syriac has, "And he said to the treasurer" (<span class= "ital">gizbara</span>). The Vulg., "And he said to those who were over the vestments." Thenius thinks the word merely means "cell" or "storechamber," like <span class= "ital">lishk?h</span>, the root of which may be cognate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm" title="And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:">1Chronicles 28:12</a>).

Thus it would be literally "vestry."<p><span class= "bld">Brought them forth vestments.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the vestments</span>--viz., those which were customary on such occasions. Thenius supposes that festival attire from Jehu's palace is meant, rather than from the wardrobe of the Baal temple. But it seems more natural to understand that Jehu simply gives directions that all the priests and prophets should be careful to wear their distinctive dress at the festival, which was to be a specially great one. (Comp. Herod. v. 5; Sil. Ital. iii. 24 <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him that was over the vestry</span>. The word translated "vestry" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) occurs only in this place; but its meaning is sufficiently ascertained, first, from the context, and secondly, from the cognate Ethiopic <span class="accented">altah</span>, which means "a linen garment." <span class="accented">Linen</span> garments were regarded as especially pure, and were generally affected by the priests of ancient religions, and preferred by the worshippers. Heathen temples had almost always "vestries" or "wardrobes" attached to them, where garments considered suitable were laid up in store. <span class="cmt_word">Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.</span> It may be doubted whether "all the worshippers of Baal" could have been supplied with robes out of the temple vestry, which would ordinarily contain only vestments for the priests. But Jehu may have had the supply kept up from the robe-room of the palace, which would be practically inexhaustible. The gift of garments to all comers, which was certainly not usual, must have been intended to render the festival as attractive as possible. <span class="cmt_word">And he brought them forth vestments.</span> The keeper of the wardrobe obeyed the order given him, and supplied vestments to all the worshippers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-28 Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of our hearts.</body></html>
