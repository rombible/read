Phot, 'Bibliothec.,' p. 1063; Max. Tyr.,' Diss.,' 38. p. 384). The Phoenicians acknowledged several deities besides Baal, as Ashtoreth, Melkarth, Dagon, Adonis or Tammuz, El, Sadyk, Esmun, and the Kabiri. The "pillars brought forth" may have represented some of these deities, who might all of them be "contemplar" deities with Baal; or they may have been "Baalim," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> forms and aspects of Baal, each the object of some special cult (see Hovers, 'Phonizier,' &sect; 674). And burned them. The "pillars" in this instance were probably, not of stone, but of wood. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-28 Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of our hearts.</body></html>
