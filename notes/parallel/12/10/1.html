Ahab had been dead about fourteen years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-1.htm" title="Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.">2Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-51.htm" title="Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.">1Kings 22:51</a>), and had had two successors on the throne. The name <span class= "ital">Ahab</span> seems to be used here as equivalent to <span class= "ital">the house of Ahab</span>. Many of the number might be strictly sons of Ahab, as he no doubt had a considerable harem.<p><span class= "bld">Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria.</span>--Jehu was crafty as well as fierce. He could not venture to the capital without first sounding the inclinations of the nobles of the city.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the rulers of Jezreel.</span>--"Jezreel" is an ancient error. The LXX. has "unto the rulers of Samaria." So Josephus. Thenius accordingly suggests that the original reading was, "and sent from Jezreel to the princes of Samaria." The Vulg. gives "ad optimates civitatis," which seems preferable. Before "the elders" we must restore "and unto" with some MSS., the LXX., Syriac, and Vulg. The original text would then run: "and sent to the princes of the city and unto the elders," &c. Reuss, on the other hand, reads "Israel" for "Jezreel."<p><span class= "bld">Them that brought up Ahab's children.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">them who brought up Ahab </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the house of Ahab). The word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm" title="Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?">Numbers 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm" title="And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.">Isaiah 49:23</a> ("nursing father"). The nobles entrusted with this charge would be responsible for the good behaviour of their wards. Ahab may have dreaded the evils of an education in the harem, and possible disputes about the succession.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">destruction of the seventy seas of Ahab</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.</span> By " sons" we must understand "male descendants. Most of the seventy wore probably his grandsons (see ver. 3); some may have been great-grandsons. They lived in Samaria; since Samaria was the principal residence of the court, Jezreel being simply a country palace - the "Versailles," as it has been called, or "Windsor" of the Israelite kings. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel.</span> "Jezreel" is almost certainly a corrupt reading. The "rulers of Jezreel" would be at Jezreel; and, if Jehu wished to communicate with them, he would not need to "write." Had any chance taken them to Samaria - a very improbable circumstance - they would have had no authority there, and to address them would have been useless. John's letters were, no doubt, addressed <span class="accented">to the rulers of Samaria</span>; and so the LXX. expressly state (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); but the reading "Jezreel" can scarcely have arisen out of "Samaria" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> out of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>), since the difference of the two words is so great. Most probably the original word was "Israel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>), which is easily corrupted into "Jezreel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>). The rulers of Samaria, the capital, might well be called "the rulers of Israel." <span class="cmt_word">To the elders</span> rather, <span class="accented">even the elders</span>. Not distinct persons from the "rulers," but the same under another name (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8, 13</a>; and compare the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And to them that brought up Ahab's children</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tutors, or governors, under whose charge they were placed - <span class="cmt_word">saying</span> - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-14 In the most awful events, though attended by the basest crimes of man, the truth and justice of God are to be noticed; and he never did nor can command any thing unjust or unreasonable. Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness from that which is the cause of all misery?</body></html>
