There is no public post. Kings and private individuals must equally find persons who will undertake to carry and deliver their despatches. Even the post organized by Darius Hystaspis was not one that went daily, but only one kept ready for the king to use when he had occasion for it. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing your master's sons are with you.</span> "Your master's sons" must mean Joram's sons; by which we learn that, unlike his brother Ahaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>), Joram had male offspring who survived him, and were now with the rest of Ahab's descendants, at Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the chariots</span>, <span class="accented">and the horses</span>, <span class="accented">a fenced city also</span>, <span class="accented">and the armor</span>. The main chariot force of the country, and the chief arsenal, containing both armor and arms, were naturally at Samaria, the capital, and might thus be regarded as at the disposition of the Samaritan municipality. Jehu scornfully challenges them to make use of their resources against him. He is quite ready for a contest. Let them do their worst. The LXX. have "fenced cities" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) instead of "a fenced city;" but the existing Hebrew text is probably right Samaria was the only fortified town in their possession. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-14 In the most awful events, though attended by the basest crimes of man, the truth and justice of God are to be noticed; and he never did nor can command any thing unjust or unreasonable. Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness from that which is the cause of all misery?</body></html>
