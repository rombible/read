They now resolved to try the fortunes of regular war with the whole strength of their army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-24.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.">2Kings 6:24</a>). It is evident, therefore, that we must not think of any gratitude on their part for the clemency of Jehoram.<p><span class= "bld">Into the land.</span>--Syriac, "into the border;" Targum, "into the border of the land." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm" title="So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.">1Samuel 7:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he prepared great provision for them.</span> Jehoram followed the directions of the prophet, carrying them out, not in the letter merely, but in the spirit. He entertained the captives at a grand banquet (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:4. &sect; 3), and then gave them leave to depart. <span class="cmt_word">And when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</span> The Syrian raids, which had hitherto been frequent, perhaps almost continuous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2</a>), now ceased for a time, and the kingdom of Israel had a respite. Bahr supposes that the raids were discontinued simply "because the Syrians had found out that they could not accomplish anything by these expeditions, but rather brought themselves into circumstances of great peril" ('Commentary on Kings,' vol. it. p. 69). But the <span class="accented">nexus</span> of the clause, "So the bands," etc., rather implies that the cessation was the consequence of Jehoram's sparing and entertaining the captives. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:13-23 What Elisha said to his servant is spoken to all the faithful servants of God, when without are fightings, and within are fears. Fear not, with that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are with us, to protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroy us. The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger. Lord, open the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thy protecting hand. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of Heaven, the less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the god of this world, blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their own ruin; but when God enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in the midst of their enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell, though, before, they thought their condition good. When Elisha had the Syrians at his mercy, he made it appear that he was influenced by Divine goodness as well as Divine power. Let us not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. The Syrians saw it was to no purpose to try to assault so great and so good a man.</body></html>
