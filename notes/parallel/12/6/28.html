Jud. vi. 3, 4).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee?</span> Probably, as Bahr suggests, the woman explained to the king that she did not appear before him to beg food, but to claim his interposition as judge, in a case in which she considered herself to be wronged. Such an appeal the king was bound to hear; and he therefore asks," What aileth thee?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "What is thy ground of complaint?" Then she tells her story. <span class="cmt_word">And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.</span> Compare the prophecy in Deuteronomy, "The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil towards the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56, 57</a>). There is historical testimony that the prophecy was three times fulfilled; viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in Samaria on the present occasion; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in Jerusalem during the last siege by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in Jerusalem during the last siege by Titus (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:03. &sect; 4). In modern sieges surrender is made before the population is driven to such straits. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:24-33 Learn to value plenty, and to be thankful for it; see how contemptible money is, when in time of famine it is so freely parted with for any thing that is eatable! The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
