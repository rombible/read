Compare the use of the same expression by Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>), and the employment of the correlative term "son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>) by Berthadad. <span class="cmt_word">Shall I smite them? shall I smite them?</span> The repetition marks extreme eagerness, while the interrogative form shows a certain amount of hesitation. It is certain that the Israelites were in the habit of putting to death their prisoners of war, not only when they were captured with arms in their hands, but even when they surrendered themselves. When a city or country was conquered, the whole male population of full age was commonly put to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-7.htm">Numbers 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>, etc.). When a third part was spared, it was from some consideration of relationship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). The Law distinctly allowed, if it did not even enjoin, the practice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>). Jehoram, therefore, no doubt, put his prisoners of war to death under ordinary circumstances. But he hesitates now. He feels that the case is an extraordinary one, and that the prophet, who has made the capture, is entitled to be consulted on the subject. Hence his question. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:13-23 What Elisha said to his servant is spoken to all the faithful servants of God, when without are fightings, and within are fears. Fear not, with that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are with us, to protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroy us. The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger. Lord, open the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thy protecting hand. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of Heaven, the less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the god of this world, blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their own ruin; but when God enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in the midst of their enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell, though, before, they thought their condition good. When Elisha had the Syrians at his mercy, he made it appear that he was influenced by Divine goodness as well as Divine power. Let us not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. The Syrians saw it was to no purpose to try to assault so great and so good a man.</body></html>
