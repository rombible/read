Ass's flesh would not ordinarily be eaten at all, and the head of any animal would be the cheapest part. Plutarch mentions that during a famine among the Cadusians an ass's head could hardly be got for sixty drachms (about 2. 10s.), though ordinarily the entire animal could be bought for about half that sum. And Pliny relates that when Hannibal was besieging Casalinum, a mouse was sold for 200 denarii (6 5s.).<p><span class= "bld">The fourth part of a cab of dove's dung</span>.--The <span class= "ital">cab</span> was the smallest Hebrew dry measure. It held, according to the Rabbis, one-sixth of a <span class= "ital">seah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-1.htm" title="Then Elisha said, Hear you the word of the LORD; Thus said the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.">2Kings 7:1</a>), or a little over a quart (<span class= "greekheb">??????</span>.--Josephus, <span class= "ital">Antt. ix.</span> 4, ? 4). The term <span class= "ital">dove's dung</span>, in all probability, denotes some kind of common <span class= "ital">vegetable</span> produce, perhaps a sort of pulse or pease, which was ordinarily very cheap. Such a designation is not unparalleled. The Arabs call the herb <span class= "ital">kali</span> "sparrow's dung;" and <span class= "ital">Assaf?tida</span> is in German "devil's dung." In some places in England a species of wild hyacinth is called "dead man's hands," from the livid markings on the flower. The shape and colour of the species of pulse mentioned in the text may similarly account for its name. It naturally occurs that so long as there were any "doves" left in the city it would not be necessary to eat their <span class= "ital">dung</span>. When Josephus wrote that dung was eaten in the siege of Jerusalem, he probably had the present passage in his mind.<p><span class= "bld">Five pieces of silver.</span>--<span class= "ital">Five</span> (shekels in) <span class= "ital">silver</span>; about 12s. 6d.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a great famine in Samaria.</span> It was Benhadad's design to capture the place, not by battering down its walls with military engines, but by blockading it, and cutting off all its supplies, as Josephus tells us (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.</span> The ass, being an unclean animal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>), would not be eaten at all except in the last extremity, and the head was the worst and so the cheapest part; yet it sold for "eighty pieces" (rather, shekels) of silver, or about &pound;5 of our money; as in the Cadusian famine mentioned by Plutarch ('Wit. Artaxerx.,' &sect; 24), where an ass's head was sold for sixty drachmas (about forty shillings). "Dove's dung" is thought by some to be the name of a plant; but it is better to understand the term literally. Both animal and human excrement have been eaten in sieges (Josephus, ' Bell. Jud.,' 5:13. &sect; 7; Cels., 'Hierobot.,' 2. p. 233), when a city was in the last extremity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:24-33 Learn to value plenty, and to be thankful for it; see how contemptible money is, when in time of famine it is so freely parted with for any thing that is eatable! The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
