He is mentioned on the monuments of Shalmaneser II., now in the British Museum, under the designation of <span class= "ital">Rammanu-hidri</span>, or idri. Now, as the Assyrians identified their god <span class= "ital">Ramm-nu</span> (Rimmon) with the Syrian deity, <span class= "ital">Adad, Addu</span>, or <span class= "ital">Dadi</span>, this title might be equivalent to <span class= "ital">Adad-idri</span>, or <span class= "ital">Addu-idri</span>. Further, in three contract tablets in the reign of Nabonidus, Mr. Pinches has read the names <span class= "ital">Bin-Addu-natanu</span> and Bin-<span class= "ital">Addu-amara</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "Bin-Addu gave," and "Bin-Ad?u commanded." Bin (or, <span class= "ital">Tur</span>)-Addu, "son of Addu," is clearly the name of a god, like abal Esarra, "son of Esarra," in the name Tiglath Pileser; and is, in fact, the Assyrian equivalent of Ben-hadad. The Syrian king's full name, therefore, would seem to have been Ben-hadad-idri, "The son of Hadad is my help" (Syriac adar, "to help"). (Comp. the name Hadad-ezer.) The Assyrians omitted the first element, the Hebrews the last.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-20.htm">2 Kings 7:20</a>. - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">siege of Samaria by Benhadad</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass after this</span> - probably some considerable time after, when the memory of Jehoram's kind act had passed away - <span class="cmt_word">that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host.</span> A contrast is intended between the inroads of small bodies of plunderers and the invasion of the territory by the monarch himself at the head of his entire force. <span class="cmt_word">And went up.</span> However Samaria was approached from Syria, there must always have been a final ascent, either from the Jordan valley or from the Plain of Esdraelon. <span class="cmt_word">And besieged Samaria.</span> Josephus says that Jehoram was afraid to meet Benhadad in the open field, since his forces were no match for those of the Syrian king, and therefore at once shut himself up within his capital, without risking a battle. The walls of Samaria were very strong. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:24-33 Learn to value plenty, and to be thankful for it; see how contemptible money is, when in time of famine it is so freely parted with for any thing that is eatable! The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
