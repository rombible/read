Meyer, Thenius, and Bahr, translate, "When they [Elisha and his servant] came down to them [the Syrians]" - either changing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, as Thenius does, or understanding <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> to refer to the "host" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>) of the Syrians. <span class="cmt_word">Elisha prayed unto the Lord, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness.</span> Not literal blindness, or they could not have followed Elisha's lead, and marched a distance of twelve miles to Samaria; but a state of confusion and Bewilderment, in which" seeing they saw, but did not perceive" (compare the "blindness" of the men of Sodom, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-11.htm">Genesis 19:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:13-23 What Elisha said to his servant is spoken to all the faithful servants of God, when without are fightings, and within are fears. Fear not, with that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are with us, to protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroy us. The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger. Lord, open the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thy protecting hand. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of Heaven, the less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the god of this world, blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their own ruin; but when God enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in the midst of their enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell, though, before, they thought their condition good. When Elisha had the Syrians at his mercy, he made it appear that he was influenced by Divine goodness as well as Divine power. Let us not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. The Syrians saw it was to no purpose to try to assault so great and so good a man.</body></html>
