(Comp. with the oath that of Jezebel against Elijah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm" title="Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.">1Kings 19:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> "continue on him" - <span class="cmt_word">this day.</span> The form of oath was a common one (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-22.htm">1 Samuel 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-23.htm">1 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>, etc.). It was an imprecation of evil on one's self, if one did, or if one failed to do, a certain thing. Why Jehoram should have considered Elisha as responsible for all the horrors of the siege is not apparent; but perhaps he supposed that it was in Elisha's power to work a miracle of any kind at any moment that he liked. If so, he misunderstood the nature of the miraculous gift. In threatening to behead Elisha, he is not making himself an executor of the Law, which nowhere sanctioned that mode of punishment, but assuming the arbitrary power of the other Oriental monarchs of his time, who regarded themselves as absolute masters of the lives and liberties of their subjects. Beheading was common in Egypt, in Babylonia, and in Assyria. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:24-33 Learn to value plenty, and to be thankful for it; see how contemptible money is, when in time of famine it is so freely parted with for any thing that is eatable! The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
