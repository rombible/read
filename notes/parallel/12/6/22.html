(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm" title="Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.">Genesis 48:22</a>.) Elisha says, "These men are virtually prisoners of war, and therefore are not to be slain in cold blood."<p>The LXX., Targum, Syriac, and Vulg., ignore the interrogative particle. The Targum and Syriac render, "Lo those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword, &c., thou dost (or mayst) kill." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-13.htm" title="And when the LORD your God has delivered it into your hands, you shall smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>.) The Vulg., "neque enim cepisti eos, ut percutias," and the Arabic, "Didst thou take them captive with thy sword, &c., that thou shouldest slay them?" come to the same thing. These renderings are interesting, as they make Elisha deny the king's right of disposal of these prisoners of Jehovah. The purpose of the miracle would have been frustrated by killing the Syrians. That purpose was to force their king and them to acknowledge the might of the true God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them.</span> The prophet has no doubt. His prohibition is absolute. These prisoners, at any rate, are not to be slain. "The object of the miracle," as Keil says, "would have been frustrated, if the Syrians had been slain. For the intention was to show the Syrians that they had to do with a prophet of the true God, against whom no human power could be of any avail, <span class="accented">that they might learn to fear the Almighty God"</span> ('Commentary on 2 Kings,' p. 3.27, Eng. trans.). There was also, perhaps, a further political object. By sparing the prisoners and treating them with kindness, it might be possible to touch the heart of the King of Syria, and dispose him towards peace. <span class="cmt_word">Wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Wouldest</span> thou be smiting those, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Wouldest thou, in smiting these persons, be smiting those whom thou hadst made prisoners in war, so as to be able to justify thy conduct by <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>? No; thou wouldest <span class="accented">not</span>. Therefore thou shalt not smite them." <span class="cmt_word">Set bread and water before them.</span> "Bread" and "water" stand for meat and drink generally. Elisha bids Jehoram entertain the captive Syrians hospitably, and then send them back to Benhadad. <span class="cmt_word">That they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:13-23 What Elisha said to his servant is spoken to all the faithful servants of God, when without are fightings, and within are fears. Fear not, with that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are with us, to protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroy us. The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger. Lord, open the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thy protecting hand. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of Heaven, the less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the god of this world, blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their own ruin; but when God enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in the midst of their enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell, though, before, they thought their condition good. When Elisha had the Syrians at his mercy, he made it appear that he was influenced by Divine goodness as well as Divine power. Let us not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. The Syrians saw it was to no purpose to try to assault so great and so good a man.</body></html>
