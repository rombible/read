Elisha had a house in Samaria, where he ordinarily resided, and from which he made his circuits. He happened to be sitting there, and the elders of the city to be sitting with him, when Jehoram sent "a man from before him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of the court officials, to put him to death. The "elders" had probably assembled at Elisha's house to consult with him on the critical situation of affairs, and (if possible) obtain from him some miraculous assistance. <span class="cmt_word">But ere the messenger came to him; he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head</span>; Elisha was supernaturally warned of what was about to take place - that an executioner was coming almost immediately to take away his life, and that the king himself would arrive shortly after. He calls the king "this son of a murderer," or rather "this son of <span class="accented">the</span> murderer," with reference to Ahab, the great murderer of the time, who had sanctioned all Jezebel's cruelties-the general massacre of the prophets of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>), the judicial murder of Naboth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9-13</a>), the attempt to kill Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>) - and had, by a fierce and long continued persecution, reduced the worshippers of Jehovah in Israel to the scanty number of seven thousand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). Jehoram had now shown that he inherited the bloodthirsty disposition of his father, and had justly earned the epithet which Elisha bestowed on him. <span class="cmt_word">Look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door.</span> Keil renders the last clause, "force him back at the door;" the LXX. "press upon him in the doorway" - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;</span> were not to allow him to enter the apartment. <span class="cmt_word">Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?</span> Elisha adds this as a reason why the elders should stop the messenger. He could not in a general way have expected them to resist the king's will as declared by his representative; but he might reasonably ask a short respite, if the king was just about to arrive at the house, to confirm the order that he had given, or to revoke it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:24-33 Learn to value plenty, and to be thankful for it; see how contemptible money is, when in time of famine it is so freely parted with for any thing that is eatable! The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
