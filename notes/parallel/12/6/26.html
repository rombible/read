The king went round to encourage the garrison and to superintend the defence. A woman in the street below, or perhaps on a housetop near the rampart, appeals to him for justice against her neighbour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as the King of Israel was passing by upon the wall.</span> The wall of Babylon is said to have been so broad at the top that a four-horse chariot could turn round on it (Herod., 1:179). All ancient cities had walls upon which a great part of the garrison stood, and from which they shot their arrows and worked their engines against the assailants. From time to time the commandant of the place - the king himself, in this instance - would mount upon the wall to visit the posts, and inspect the state of the garrison, or observe the movements of the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">There cried a woman unto him.</span> Houses sometimes abutted on the wall of a town (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>, etc.), and women sometimes took part in their defense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>), so that in visiting the posts a commandant might be brought into contact with women. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Help, my lord, O king</span>; rather, <span class="accented">save</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "preserve me from perishing of hunger." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:24-33 Learn to value plenty, and to be thankful for it; see how contemptible money is, when in time of famine it is so freely parted with for any thing that is eatable! The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
