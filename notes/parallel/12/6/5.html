We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a> that the Hebrews made their axe-heads of iron as early as the time of Moses. They probably learnt to smelt and work iron in Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">Fell into the water.</span> The tree must have been one that grew close to the river's edge. As the man hewed away at the stem a little above the root, the axe-head flew from the haft, into which it was insecurely fitted, and fell into the water. The slipping of an axe-head was a very common occurrence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>), and ordinarily was of little consequence, since it was easily restored to its place. But now the head had disappeared. <span class="cmt_word">And he cried, and said, Alas, master!</span> - rather, <span class="accented">Alas</span>, <span class="accented">my master</span>! or, <span class="accented">Alas</span>, <span class="accented">my lord</span>! - <span class="cmt_word">for it was borrowed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it was a borrowed one</span>. The words are part of the man's address to Elisha. He means to say, "It is no common misfortune; it is not as if it had been my own axe. I had borrowed it, and now what shall I say to the owner?" There is no direct request for help, but the tone of the complaint constitutes a sort of silent appeal. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 There is that pleasantness in the converse of servants of God, which can make those who listen to them forget the pain and the weariness of labour. Even the sons of the prophets must not be unwilling to labour. Let no man think an honest employment a burden or a disgrace. And labour of the head, is as hard, and very often harder, than labour with the hands. We ought to be careful of that which is borrowed, as of our own, because we must do as we would be done by. This man was so respecting the axe-head. And to those who have an honest mind, the sorest grievance of poverty is, not so much their own want and disgrace, as being rendered unable to pay just debts. But the Lord cares for his people in their smallest concerns. And God's grace can thus raise the stony iron heart, which is sunk into the mud of this world, and raise up affections, naturally earthly.</body></html>
