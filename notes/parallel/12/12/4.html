The currency at this period consisted of pieces of silver of a fixed weight. There was no such thing as a Hebrew coinage before the exile. The reason "current money" was wanted was that it might be paid out immediately to the workpeople employed in the repairs.<p><span class= "bld">The money that every man is set at.</span>--Literally<span class= "ital">, each the money of the souls of his valuation, i.e.</span>, every kind of redemption money, such as was paid in the case of the first-born (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-16.htm" title="And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.">Numbers 18:16</a>) and of a vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.">Leviticus 27:2</a>, seq.).

The chronicler's language, indeed, appears to indicate that he understood the money collected to have been chiefly the tax of half a shekel, which the law ordered to be paid by every male on occasion of the census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12-16</a>), for the good of the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-16.</span> - The <span class="accented">repair of the temple</span>. It is rather surprising that the temple had not been thoroughly repaired by Jehoiada during the long minority of Joash, when he must practically have had the sole management of affairs. Probably he did repair the worst of the damage done by Athaliah's orders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>), which may have been very considerable, but neglected the restoration of such portions of the edifice as appeared to him of secondary importance, as the walls of the courts and the outbuildings. Joash, however, when his minority came to an end, and he succeeded to the administration of the state, took a different view. To him the completion of the repairs seemed a pressing business. Probably he thought the honor of God required the entire obliteration of Athaliah's wicked proceedings, and the renewal of the temple's old glories. His six years' residence within the temple precincts may have also inspired him with a love of the building as a building. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash said to the priests.</span> The initiative of Joash is strongly marked, alike in Kings and Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4</a>). The general weakness of his character, and want of vigor and decision, make it the more surprising that he should in this particular matter have shown himself capable of taking his own line and adhering to it (ver. 7). He has scarcely received from historians the credit that is due to him for his persistent and successful efforts to accomplish an object which was for the honor of religion, and which was yet not pressed forward by the priesthood. Certainly he was no mere puppet of the priestly order. <span class="cmt_word">All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the money of the holy gifts that is brought into the house of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all that ye receive from the people in the way of money. This money accrued from three sources, which the king proceeded to enumerate. First, even <span class="cmt_word">the money of every one that passeth</span> the account; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the census money - the aggregate of the half-shekels received from the males of above twenty years old, whenever a census was taken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>). The rendering, "current money," preferred by Thenius, Bahr, and our Revisers, is shown by Keil to be untenable. Secondly, the <span class="cmt_word">money that every man is set at</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the redemption money, derived in part from the payments made for redeeming the firstborn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15, 16</a>); in part from the sums which the priests exacted from such as had vowed themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-2.htm">Leviticus 27:2-8</a>), or those belonging to them, to God. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> [thirdly] <span class="cmt_word">all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the free-will offerings that should be made in money by any of the Israelites. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 It is a great mercy to young people, especially to all young men of rank, like Jehoash, to have those about them who will instruct them to do what is right in the sight of the Lord; and they do wisely and well for themselves, when willing to be counselled and ruled. The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.</body></html>
