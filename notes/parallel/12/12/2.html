(The accent dividing the verse ought to fall on "the Lord" rather than on "his days.") Perhaps the peculiar form of the sentence arose in this way: the writer first set down the usual statement concerning kings who supported the worship of Jehovah, and then, remembering the evils which ensued upon the death of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm" title="Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.">2Chronicles 24:17</a>), added as a correction of that statement, "during which Jehoiada the priest instructed him." Thenius says the words <span class= "ital">can</span> only be rendered, <span class= "ital">all his life long, because Jehoiada had instructed him</span>. They certainly <span class= "ital">can</span>, however, be rendered as our version renders them, and further, thus: "And Jehoash did . . . all his days, <span class= "ital">whom Jehoiada the priest instructed."</span> But the ambiguity of the statement gave an opportunity for discrediting the chronicler.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.</span> So the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Luther, De Wette, Keil, Bahr, and our Revisers. Only Ewald and Thenius attempt to make the passage contradict Chronicles by translating, "Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days, because Jehoiada the priest had instructed him." But this translation is very forced and unnatural. The writer evidently intended to add a qualifying clause to his statement that Joash reigned well "all his days," but did not wish to draw too much attention to it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 It is a great mercy to young people, especially to all young men of rank, like Jehoash, to have those about them who will instruct them to do what is right in the sight of the Lord; and they do wisely and well for themselves, when willing to be counselled and ruled. The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.</body></html>
