Again the narrative of Kings is to be supplemented by that of Chronicles. From Chronicles we learn that, before the withdrawal of the Syrians, Joash had fallen into a severe illness, which confined him to his apartment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>). This gave opportunity for conspiracy. Among the courtiers were two, perhaps more, whom the fate of Zechariah had grieved, and who were probably opposed to the entire series of later changes in religion which had been sanctioned by Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17, 18</a>). These persons "made a conspiracy," which was successful, and "slew Joash on his bed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>). They then buried him in Jerusalem, but "not in the sepulchers of the kings." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> This formal phrase, with which he concludes his account of almost every Jewish king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-29.htm">1 Kings 14:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-7.htm">1 Kings 15:7, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-45.htm">1 Kings 22:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-23.htm">2 Kings 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-18.htm">2 Kings 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-6.htm">2 Kings 15:6</a>, etc.), cannot be regarded as an acknowledgment by the author of any special or designed reticence with respect to the reign of Joash. We must suppose him unconscious of any such design. He had to omit much in every case; in the present he happened to omit all the darker shades; and the result was an over-favorable portraiture of the monarch. But, in the providence of God, complete historical justice was secured by the labors and researches of a second inspired writer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:17-21 Let us review the character of Jehoash, and consider what we may learn from it. When we see what a sad conclusion there was to so promising a beginning, it ought to make us seek into our spiritual declinings. If we know any thing of Christ as the foundation of our faith and hope, let us desire to know nothing but Christ. May the work of the blessed Spirit on our souls be manifest; may we see, feel, and be earnest, in seeking after Jesus in all his fulness, suitableness, and grace, that our souls may be brought over from dead works to serve the living and true God.</body></html>
