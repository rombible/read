It is evident, however, that the king now took the control of the funds and the work out of their hands. Probably the revenues of the sanctuary had been in a very languishing condition during the late reigns; and the priesthood had used whatever offerings they received for their own support. They would now very naturally be unwilling to appropriate any part of the revenues which they had come to regard as their own. to the work of repair. From the account in Chronicles it would not appear that any money was collected for the purpose of restoration before the king took the matter into his own hands. The idea of Thenins, that Joash wished to humble the pride of the priests by diminishing their revenues, is not contained in either narrative. But it is in itself likely that the moral tone of the whole order had degenerated in the late period of apostasy.<p><span class= "bld">But deliver it for the breaches of the house.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">For to the dilapidation of the house ye should give it; scil</span>., and not apply it to any other purposes. The king's words certainly seem to throw suspicion on the priests.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest.</span> So, too, the writer of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-6.htm">2 Chronicles 24:6</a>). The king did not take the matter into his own hands, but consulted with the head of the priestly order on the best steps to take in order to expedite the repairs. He made no" charge," delivered no "rebuke." He did not "remove the administration of the funds from the hands of the delinquent order" (Stanley). On the contrary, he left it in their hands (vers. 9-11). Two changes only were made: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A public chest was set up conspicuously in the temple court, near the great altar, and the people were invited to bring their contributions to the temple, and hand them to the priests, who should straightway deposit them in the chest in the sight of the congregation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The chest was opened from time to time, and the money counted, in the presence of the high priest <span class="accented">and of a royal secretary</span>. It was then delivered over to "the overseers of the house" - persons, probably, of the priestly order - appointed by Jehoiada (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), who disbursed it to the carpenters and masons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-11.htm">2 Kings 12:11, 12</a>). The chest was a sort of tangible evidence to the people of the purpose to which their contributions would be applied, and naturally stimulated their giving. The presence of the king's officer at the counting of the money, was equivalent, not really to an "audit" (Stanley), but to a publication of the accounts, and would prevent any suspension of the work, so long as it was clear that the money found in the chest had not been expended. Thus a new impetus was given to the movement. The measures taken completely answered. Contributions flowed in rapidly, and in a few years the whole work was accomplished (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house?</span> This shows that no repairs were going on 'in the twenty-third year of Joash, but not that none had been done previously. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore receive no more money of your acceptance.</span> This was a revocation of the order given in ver. 5, and necessarily put an end to the local collections, which that order required. But deliver it for the breaches of the house. If the priests were not to "receive the money," they could not "deliver" it. Obscurity is introduced by the desire for extreme brevity. In point of fact, they were to "receive" (ver. 9), but in a new way. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 It is a great mercy to young people, especially to all young men of rank, like Jehoash, to have those about them who will instruct them to do what is right in the sight of the Lord; and they do wisely and well for themselves, when willing to be counselled and ruled. The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.</body></html>
