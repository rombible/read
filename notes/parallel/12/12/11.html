The bags, when weighed, were handed over by the high priest and the royal secretary to the officers whom Jehoiada had appointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>) to have the general superintendence of the "house." <span class="cmt_word">And they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the Lord.</span> The "paid it out" of our Revisers is better than "laid it out."

The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.</body></html>
