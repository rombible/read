These would be paid out as money. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-23.htm" title="And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.">2Kings 5:23</a>.) Instead of "they bound up," Ewald prefers the word used in Chronicles, "they emptied," which is very similar in Hebrew writing. The royal secretary came, as the king's representative, to make a record of the amount.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest.</span> "When they saw" means "when they perceived." They would not <span class="accented">see</span> that the chest was becoming full, but would know by the weight, and perhaps by the sound which the money made when it was dropped in. <span class="cmt_word">That the king's scribe.</span> "Royal secretaries" were common in ancient Persia, and often acted as the king's commissioners (Herod., 3:128; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:6. &sect; 16; 'AEcouom.,' 4:8). Such persons are seen on the Assyrian sculptured slabs, with a roll of paper or parchment in one hand, and a pen in the other, taking account for the king of the spoil brought in from foreign countries (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 86). <span class="cmt_word">And the high priest.</span> Since the time of Joshua, the high priest had been called simply "the priest." The restoration of the full title (<span class="accented">hae-cohen hag-gadol</span>) marks the increasing power of the priests and the diminishing power of the kings under the later monarchy. <span class="cmt_word">Came up, and they put up in bags, and told, the money that was found in the house of the Lord.</span> Money was ordinarily put up in bags, containing a certain definite amount, the mouth of the bag being then tied round with a string (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-20.htm">Proverbs 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>). Hence putting money up in bags was sometimes called, as in this place, "binding it." No doubt they "told," or counted, the money first, and put it in the bags afterwards; but <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> very common figure of speech. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 It is a great mercy to young people, especially to all young men of rank, like Jehoash, to have those about them who will instruct them to do what is right in the sight of the Lord; and they do wisely and well for themselves, when willing to be counselled and ruled. The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.</body></html>
