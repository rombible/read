Jehoram, and Ahaziah . . . had dedicated</span>--Although these kings had sought to naturalise the Baal-worship, they had not ventured to abolish that of Jehovah. On the contrary, as appears from this passage, they even tried to conciliate the powerful priesthood and numerous adherents of the national religion, by dedicating gifts to the sanctuary. The fact that there was so much treasure disposable is not to be wondered at, even after the narrative of the way in which funds were raised for repairing the Temple; because the treasure in question, especially that of the Temple, appears to have been regarded as a reserve, only to be touched in case of grave national emergency like the present.<p><span class= "bld">And he went away from Jerusalem</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, withdrew his forces. Thenius asserts that the present expedition of Hazael is distinct from that recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.">2Chronicles 24:23</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>., which he admits to be historical. But it is not said here that Hazael went in person against Jerusalem. (Comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.">2Kings 12:17</a>, "set his face to go up," <span class= "ital">i.e., prepared</span> to march thither.) The serious defeat of the army of Jehoash, related in Chronicles, accounts very satisfactorily for the sacrifice of his treasures here specified'; while the withdrawal of the Syrians after their victory, as told in Chronicles, is explained by the bribe which Jehoash is here said to have paid them. The two narratives thus supplement each other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash King of Judah took all the hallowed things.</span> The writer of Chronicles tells us that, first of all, there was a battle. "The army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-24.htm">2 Chronicles 24:24</a>). The loss was especially heavy among the nobles, who officered the Jewish army. Much plunder was taken by the visitors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>). Then, probably, the siege of the city was commenced, and Joash, like Rehoboam and Asa before him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), and Hezekiah subsequently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15, 16</a>), had recourse to the temple treasures, and with them bought off the invader. It is noticeable that Athaliah had not deprived the temple of them previously. <span class="cmt_word">That Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated.</span> Though Jehoram and Ahaziah apostatized so far as to maintain the Baal-worship in Jerusalem, and even to force attendance on it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>), yet they did not relinquish altogether the worship of Jehovah. That Jehoram called his son, Ahaziah, "possession of Jehovah," and Ahaziah one of his sons, Joash, "whom Jehovah supports," is indicative of this syncretism, which was common in ancient times, but against which pure Judaism made the strongest possible protest. <span class="cmt_word">And his own hallowed things</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the gifts which he had himself made to the temple - <span class="cmt_word">and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord.</span> This was probably not much; but some "vessels of gold" had been made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a>) out of the residue of the money subscribed for the repairs. <span class="cmt_word">And in the king's house.</span> The royal palace had been plundered by the Arabs and Philistines combined in the reign of Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16, 17</a>); but in the thirty years that had since elapsed there had been time for fresh accumulations. <span class="cmt_word">And sent it to Hazael King of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.</span> The personal presence of Hazael at the siege seems to be here implied, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a> rather implies his absence. Perhaps he was absent at first, but joined the besiegers after a while. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:17-21 Let us review the character of Jehoash, and consider what we may learn from it. When we see what a sad conclusion there was to so promising a beginning, it ought to make us seek into our spiritual declinings. If we know any thing of Christ as the foundation of our faith and hope, let us desire to know nothing but Christ. May the work of the blessed Spirit on our souls be manifest; may we see, feel, and be earnest, in seeking after Jesus in all his fulness, suitableness, and grace, that our souls may be brought over from dead works to serve the living and true God.</body></html>
