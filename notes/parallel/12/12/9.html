This can hardly refer to the same position. It probably describes where the chest, which became a permanent feature of the sanctuary, stood in the time after the return from the Captivity. The chronicler adds that offerings were asked by proclamation throughout the country, and that the princes and people readily contributed.<p><span class= "bld">Put.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">used to put</span>. The chest was kept locked, and the Levitical doorkeepers received the money from those who offered it, and dropped it at once into the chest. This obviated all suspicion of a possible misapplication of the contributions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jehoiada the priest took a chest.</span> The writer of Chronicles says, "At the king's commandment, they made a chest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>). The suggestion was probably the king's, but the ecclesiastical and civil authorities worked harmoniously in the business. <span class="cmt_word">And bored a hole in the lid of it</span> - as hundreds of thousands have done since his time - <span class="cmt_word">and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the Lord.</span> The altar intended is, of course, the altar of burnt offering, which was in the court of the temple, directly opposite the porch. The chest was placed outside the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>), and, indeed, outside the porch, on the right hand as one entered into the court by the north door. It was thus very conspicuous. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests that kept the door</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the door of the court - <span class="cmt_word">put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord.</span> The priests received the money from those who offered, at the gate of the court, and, proceeding to the chest, dropped it in through the aperture. A man could not see that all which he had given was put in, but he reckoned on the good faith of the priest, and was satisfied. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 It is a great mercy to young people, especially to all young men of rank, like Jehoash, to have those about them who will instruct them to do what is right in the sight of the Lord; and they do wisely and well for themselves, when willing to be counselled and ruled. The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.</body></html>
