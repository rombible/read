The LXX. and Syriac read, "and touching this thing," an improvement in the connection.<p><span class= "bld">To worship</span>.--To bow down (the same verb occurs thrice in the verse).<p><span class= "bld">The house of Rimmon</span>.--The Assyrian Rammanu (from <span class= "ital">ram?mu</span>, "to thunder"). One of his epithets in the cuneiform is <span class= "ital">Ramimu</span>, "the thunderer;" and another is <span class= "ital">Barqu</span> (=<span class= "ital">Bariqu</span>), "he who lightens." Rimmon was the god of the atmosphere, called in Accadian, AN. IM ("god of the air or wind"), figured on bas-reliefs and cylinders as armed with the thunderbolt. His name is prominent in the story of the Flood (e.g., it is said Rammanu irmum, "Rimmon thundered"); and one of his standing titles is <span class= "ital">Rahicu</span> ("he who deluges"). The Assyrians identified Ramman with the Aramean and Edomite Hadad. (Comp. the name Hadad-rimmon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm" title="In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.">Zechariah 12:11</a>; and Tabrimon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm" title="Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelled at Damascus, saying,">1Kings 15:18</a>.) A list of no fewer than forty-one titles of Rimmon has been found among the cuneiform tablets.<p><span class= "bld">Leaneth on my hand.</span>--A metaphor denoting the attendance on the king by his favourite grandee or principal adjutant. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm" title="Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.">2Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-17.htm" title="And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.">2Kings 7:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">When I bow down myself.</span>--An Aramaic form is used. The clause is omitted in some Hebrew MSS.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord pardon thy servant.</span>--Naaman had solemnly promised to serve no god but Jehovah for the future. He now prays that an unavoidable exception--which will, indeed, be such only in appearance--may be excused by Jehovah. His request is not, of course, to be judged by a Christian standard. By the reply, "Go in peace," the prophet, as spokesman of Jehovah, acceded to Naaman's prayer. "Naaman durst not profess conversion to the foreign cultus before the king, his master; so he asks leave to go on assisting at the national rites" (Reuss).<p><span class= "bld">The Lord pardon.</span>--In the current Hebrew text it is <span class= "ital">the Lord pardon, I pray.</span> The LXX. appears to have had the same reading; but very many MSS. and all the other versions omit the precative particle. It is, however, probably genuine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant.</span> Naaman is not prepared to be a martyr for his religion. On returning to Damascus, it will be among his civil duties to accompany his master to the national temples, and to prostrate himself before the images of the national deities. If he declines, if (like an early Christian) he will not enter "the house of devils," much less bow down before the graven image of a false god, it may cost him his life; it will certainly cost him his court favor. For such a sacrifice he is not prepared. Yet his conscience tells him that he will be acting wrongly. He therefore expresses a hope, or a prayer, that his fault, for a fault he feels that it will be, may be forgiven him - that Jehovah will not be "extreme to mark what is done amiss," but will excuse his outward conformity to his inward faith and zeal. That <span class="cmt_word">when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon.</span> Riminon is probably derived from <span class="accented">rum</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>), "to be high," and means "the exalted god," according to the gloss of He-sychins - <span class="greek">&#x3a1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. It is wrongly connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, "a pomegranate," and should rather be compared with the Arabic <span class="accented">Er Rhaman</span>, "the Most High." The royal name, "Tab-Bitumen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), contains the root, as does also the local name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>), "Hadad-Rimmon." This last word gives rise to the suspicion that Hadad and Rimmon are merely two names of the same deity, who was called "Hadad" or "Hadar" as bright and glorious, "Rim-men" as lofty and exalted. <span class="cmt_word">To worship there, and he leaneth on my hand</span>. Either Naaman's leprosy must have been recent, and he refers to the king's practice in former times, or there must have been far less horror of leprosy among the Syrians than there was among the Hebrews. And I bow myself in the house of Rimmon - before the image, or at any rate before the supposed presence of the god - <span class="cmt_word">when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing.</span> The repetition of the clause indicates Naaman's anxiety on the subject. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-19 The mercy of the cure affected Naaman more than the miracle. Those are best able to speak of the power of Divine grace, who themselves experience it. He also shows himself grateful to Elisha the prophet. Elijah refused any recompence, not because he thought it unlawful, for he received presents from others, but to show this new convert that the servants of the God of Israel looked upon worldly wealth with a holy contempt. The whole work was from God, in such a manner, that the prophet would not give counsel when he had no directions from the Lord. It is not well violently to oppose the lesser mistakes which unite with men's first convictions; we cannot bring men forward any faster than the Lord prepares them to receive instruction. Yet as to us, if, in covenanting with God, we desire to reserve any known sin, to continue to indulge ourselves in it, that is a breach of his covenant. Those who truly hate evil, will make conscience of abstaining from all appearances of evil.</body></html>
