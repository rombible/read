"My father" is a deferential and, at the same time, an affectionate address, not unnatural in the mouth of a confidential servant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>). There is thus no need of any alteration of the text, such as Ewald (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) or Thenius (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) proposes. It must be admitted, however, that the LXX. seem to have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> in their copies. <span class="cmt_word">If the prophet had bid thee</span> do some <span class="cmt_word">great thing</span> - "had set thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "some difficult task" - <span class="cmt_word">wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then,</span> [shouldest thou perform his behest] <span class="cmt_word">when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</span> The reasoning was unanswerable, and took effect. Naaman was persuaded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-14 Elisha knew Naaman to be a proud man, and he would let him know, that before the great God all men stand upon the same level. All God's commands make trial of men's spirits, especially those which direct a sinner how to apply for the blessings of salvation. See in Naaman the folly of pride; a cure will not content him, unless he be cured with pomp and parade. He scorns to be healed, unless he be humoured. The way by which a sinner is received and made holy, through the blood, and by the Spirit of Christ, through faith alone in his name, does not sufficiently humour or employ self, to please the sinner's heart. Human wisdom thinks it can supply wiser and better methods of cleansing. Observe, masters should be willing to hear reason. As we should be deaf to the counsel of the ungodly, though given by great and respected names, so we are to have our ears open to good advice, though brought by those below us. Wouldst thou not do any thing? When diseased sinners are content to do any thing, to submit to any thing, to part with any thing, for a cure, then, and not till then, is there any hope of them. The methods for the healing of the leprosy of sin, are so plain, that we are without excuse if we do not observe them. It is but, Believe, and be saved; Repent, and be pardoned; Wash, and be clean. The believer applies for salvation, not neglecting, altering, or adding to the Saviour's directions; he is thus made clean from guilt, while others, who neglect them, live and die in the leprosy of sin.</body></html>
