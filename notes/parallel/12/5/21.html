Thus Gehazi, if he went at his best speed, could expect to overtake, and did actually overtake, the cavalcade of Naaman. He probably overtook them at a very short distance from Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And when Naaman saw him running after him.</span> Gehazi was pressed for time. He could not start at once, lest he should make it too plain that he was going m pursuit of Naaman; and he could not absent himself from the house too long, lest his master should call for him. He had, therefore, at whatever loss of dignity, to hurry himself, and actually "run after" the Syrian. Naaman, either accidentally looking back, or warned by some of his train, sees him, recognizes him, and is only too glad to respond to his wishes. <span class="cmt_word">He lighted down from the chariot to meet him.</span> An act of great condescension. As Bahr notes, "Descent from a vehicle is, in the East, a sign of respect from the inferior to the superior;" and Naaman, in lighting down from his chariot, must have intended to "honor the prophet in his servant" ('Commentary on Kings,' vol. 2. p. 55). But such honor is not commonly paid, and thus the act of Naaman was abnormal. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Is all well?</span> The words admit of no better translation. Seeing Gehazi's haste and anxious looks, Naaman suspects that all is <span class="accented">not</span> well, that something has happened since he left the prophet's house, and accordingly puts his question, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x20;&#x5da;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5da;&#x5e8;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5be;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>? (Vulgate). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:20-27 Naaman, a Syrian, a courtier, a soldier, had many servants, and we read how wise and good they were. Elisha, a holy prophet, a man of God, has but one servant, and he proves a base liar. The love of money, that root of all evil, was at the bottom of Gehazi's sin. He thought to impose upon the prophet, but soon found that the Spirit of prophecy could not be deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the Holy Ghost. It is folly to presume upon sin, in hopes of secrecy. When thou goest aside into any by-path, does not thy own conscience go with thee? Does not the eye of God go with thee? He that covers his sin, shall not prosper; particularly, a lying tongue is but for a moment. All the foolish hopes and contrivances of carnal worldlings are open before God. It is not a time to increase our wealth, when we can only do it in such ways as are dishonourable to God and religion, or injurious to others. Gehazi was punished. If he will have Naaman's money, he shall have his disease with it. What was Gehazi profited, though he gained two talents, when thereby he lost his health, his honour, his peace, his service, and, if repentance prevented not, his soul for ever? Let us beware of hypocrisy and covetousness, and dread the curse of spiritual leprosy remaining on our souls.</body></html>
