Thenius thinks the formal specification of Amaziah's descent indicates that this narrative was derived from "the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel." At all events, it emphasises the importance of the incident, which is further indicated in the original by the order of the words: "And Amaziah king of Judah . . . did Jehoash king of Israel take . . ."<p><span class= "bld">Came.</span>--So the Hebrew margin. The Hebrew text has, <span class= "ital">brought him</span> (<span class= "ital">way'bi'o;</span> a rare form). So Chronicles and the Vulg., but not the other versions. Jehoash brought Amaziah a prisoner to his own capital.<p><span class= "bld">Brake down the wall.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">made a breach in the wall.</span> No resistance appears to have been offered. Josephus relates that Amaziah was induced by menaces of death to order the gates to be thrown open to the enemy; a needless assumption, considering that the army had been routed and the king was a captive. He adds, that Jehoash rode in his chariot through the breach in the walls, leading Amaziah as a prisoner.<p><span class= "bld">From the gate.</span>--So Chronicles and the <span class= "ital">Syriac,</span> Vulg., and Arabic here. The Hebrew text <span class= "ital">has, at the gate</span>, which is due to the common confusion of the letters <span class= "ital">b</span> and <span class= "ital">m</span> (<span class= "ital">be, "in;" min,</span> "from"). The following "unto" shows that "from" is right.<p><span class= "bld">Of Ephraim.</span>--This gate lay on the north side of the city, and was also called the "Gate of Benjamin." It answers to the modern Damascus gate.<p><span class= "bld">The corner gate.</span>--This gate was at the north-west corner of the wall at the point where it trended southwards.<p><span class= "bld">Four hundred cubits.</span>--That is, about 222 yards. The insolence of a victorious enemy is sufficient to account for this conduct of Jehoash. It was also a forcible way of convincing Amaziah that even his strongest city was not proof against the prowess of <span class= "ital">Ephraim.</span> Thenius thinks that Jehoash wanted to make room for the triumphal entry of his troops.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash King of Israel took Amaziah King of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah at Beth-shemesh</span> - Josephus says (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) that Amaziah was deserted by his troops, who were seized with a sudden panic and fled from the field - <span class="cmt_word">and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem.</span> According to Josephus, Joash threatened his prisoner with death unless the gates of Jerusalem were opened to him, and his army admitted into the town; and it was upon Amaziah's representations that the surrender was made as soon as the Israelite army appeared before the place. The breach in the wall was therefore not the result of siege operations, but the act of a conqueror, who desired to leave his enemy as defenseless as possible. <span class="cmt_word">From the gate of Ephraim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the main gate in the northern wall of the city - that by which travelers ordinarily proceeded into the territory of the tribe of Ephraim. In later times it seems to have been called indifferently "the gate of Ephraim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>) and "the gate of Benjamin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>). The great north road, which passed through it, led across the Benjamite into the Ephraim-its territory. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the corner gate.</span> The, "corner gate" is generally thought to have been that at the north-western angle of the City wall, where it turned southward, but this is perhaps doubtful. The exact line of the city wall in the time of Amaziah is exceedingly uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Four hundred cubits</span>; six hundred feet, or two hundred yards. This seems to have been the entire distance between the two gates. As there were at least thirteen gates in the circuit of the walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-31.htm">Nehemiah 12:31-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>), which were probably not mere extensive than those of the present town (3960 yards), the distance of two hundred yards between one gate and another would not be improbable, the <span class="accented">average</span> distance being about three hundred yards. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:8-14 For some time after the division of the kingdoms, Judah suffered much from the enmity of Israel. After Asa's time, it suffered more by the friendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meet with hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to hear two proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify and undervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excites contentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to those who are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin in private life; but when they arise between princes, they become the misery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of his challenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is in the heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, the occasion, whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented, or the like, but their own hearts do it.</body></html>
