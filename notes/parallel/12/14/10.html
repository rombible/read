Rest on thy laurels, and do not risk them by further enterprises which may not turn out so favourably. So the Vulg. Thenius explains: "Show thy might at home," referring to the LXX. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-20.htm" title="Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!">2Samuel 6:20</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt?--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">and why shouldst thou challenge or provoke</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">attack</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-5.htm" title="Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>) <span class= "ital">disaster?</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast indeed smitten Edom</span> (see ver. 7, and the comment), <span class="cmt_word">and thine heart hath lifted thee up</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, made thee proud, exalted thee above measure - <span class="cmt_word">glory of this, and tarry at home</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, rest content with the glory which thou hast gained in thy Edomite war; make thy boast thereof, but do not affront fresh dangers - <span class="cmt_word">for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt</span> - literally, <span class="accented">why wilt thou meddle with misfortune</span>? <span class="accented"> - <span class="cmt_word"></span>that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</span> Joash was as confident of success, if it came to war, as Amaziah. His three victories over Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-25.htm">2 Kings 13:25</a>) were, he thought, at least as good evidence of military strength as Amaziah's one victory over Edom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:8-14 For some time after the division of the kingdoms, Judah suffered much from the enmity of Israel. After Asa's time, it suffered more by the friendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meet with hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to hear two proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify and undervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excites contentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to those who are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin in private life; but when they arise between princes, they become the misery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of his challenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is in the heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, the occasion, whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented, or the like, but their own hearts do it.</body></html>
