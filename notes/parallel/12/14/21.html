Though reserving his account of the reign of Azariah to the next chapter (vers. 1-7), the writer is led by the circumstances of Amaziah's death to mention <span class="accented">at once</span> the fact of his son Azariah's succession, and the first important act of his reign, the resumption of war with Edom. He then breaks off suddenly, in order to interpose an account of the reign of Jeroboam II., who was contemporary with Amaziah during fourteen years of his reign, <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people of Judah took Azariah.</span> This is a new expression, and implies a new, perhaps a tumultuary, proceeding. The <span class="accented">people</span>, uncertain probably of the intentions of the conspirators, and fearful that they might set up a king not of the house of David, took the initiative, went to the royal palace, and finding there a son of Amaziah - whether his eldest son or not, we cannot say - proclaimed him king and placed him upon the throne. The author of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>) agrees. Josephus is silent. <span class="cmt_word">Which was sixteen years old.</span> Young certainly, considering that his father was fifty-four (see ver. 2), but not necessarily "a younger son," since Amaziah's earlier children may have been daughters, or he may have married late in life. It is not doubted that Manasseh was Hezekiah's eldest son, yet he was only twelve when Hezekiah died at the same age as Amaziah, viz. fifty-four. <span class="cmt_word">And made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</span> There are two forms of the king's name, Azariah and Uzziah. The difference between them is not so great in the Hebrew, where they both begin with the same letter; but still it is considerable. One name is not a mere contraction of the other. Some suppose that the king changed one name for the other upon his accession; others, that he was called indifferently by either, since they were very similar in meaning. "Azariah" is "he whose help is Jehovah;" "Uzziah," "he whose strength is Jehovah." "Uzziah" is the predominant form, occurring four times in 2 Kings, twelve times in 2 Chronicles, three times in Isaiah, once in Hoses, once in Amos, and once in Zechariah; while "Azariah" occurs only in 2 Kings (eight times) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a> (once). Josephus uses the form "Ozias" (equivalent to, Uzziah), and so does St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8, 9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:15-22 Amaziah survived his conqueror fifteen years. He was slain by his own subjects. Azariah, or Uzziah, seems to have been very young when his father was slain. Though the years of his reign are reckoned from that event, he was not fully made king till eleven years afterwards.</body></html>
