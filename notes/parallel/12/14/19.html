(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm" title="And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,">2Chronicles 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear.

Amaziah's flight thither seems to indicate either a popular rising in Jerusalem, or a military revolt.<p><span class= "bld">They sent after him to Lachish.</span>--This, too, may point to a military outbreak.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem.</span> The author of Chronicles connects this conspiracy with the idolatry of which Amaziah was guilty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>); but, though his subjects may have been offended by his religions changes, and have become alienated from him in consequence, the actual conspiracy can scarcely have been prompted by an act which was fifteen, or at any rate thirteen, years old. It is more likely to have sprung out of dissatisfaction with Amaziah's military inaction from and after his defeat by Joash. While Jeroboam H. was carrying all before him in the north, recovering his border, pushing it as far as Hamath, and even exercising a suzerainty over Damascus (vers. 25, 28), Amaziah remained passive, cowed by his one defeat, and took no advantage of the state of weakness to which he had reduced Edom, but sat with folded hands, doing nothing. The conspirators who removed Amaziah, and placed his son Azariah, or Uzziah, upon the throne, may be credited with the wish and intention to bring the period of inaction to an end, and to effect in the south what Jeroboam was effecting in the north. It is true that Azariah was but sixteen years of age (ver. 21; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>), but he may have given indications of his ambition and capacity. Sixteen, moreover, is the time of manhood in the East, and the conspirators had probably waited until Azariah was sixteen in order that his competency to reign should not be disputed. As soon as he was on the throne he initiated the warlike policy which they desired (see ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">And he fled to Lachish.</span> Lachish, one of the south-western Judaean towns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), was at all times a fortress of importance. It resisted Joshua (Joshua 10:3, 31), and was taken by storm. It was fortified by Jeroboam against the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>). It was besieged and taken by Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152). The position is marked by the modern Um-<span class="accented">Lakis</span>, on "a low round swell or knoll," between Gaza and Beit-Jibrin, about thirteen miles from Gaza and nearly thirty-five from Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">But they sent after him to Lackish, and slew him there.</span> So the author of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>) and Josephus ('Ant.

He was slain by his own subjects. Azariah, or Uzziah, seems to have been very young when his father was slain.
