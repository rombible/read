All the others had fallen short more or less; and Amaziah fell short in many respects. He was wanting in "a perfect heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fixed intention to do God's will; he was proud and boastful (ver. 10); he gave way to idolatry in his later years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>), and he despised the reproof of the prophet who was sent to rebuke his sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-16.htm">2 Chronicles 25:16</a>).

The two kings were differently circumstanced, and history did not "repeat itself" in their reigns. The position of Joash with respect to Jehoiada finds no parallel in the circumstances of the life of Amaziah. Still, the lives are parallel to some extent. Both kings began better than they ended. Both were zealous for Jehovah at first, but turned to idolatry at last. Both opposed themselves to prophets, and treated their rebukes with scorn. Both reused conspiracy against them by their misconduct, and were murdered by the malcontents. Further, both were unsuccessful in war, had to withstand a siege of their capital, and bought off their enemy by the surrender of the greater part of its wealth, including the treasures of the temple (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-7 Amaziah began well, but did not go on so. It is not enough to do that which our pious predecessors did, merely to keep up the common usage, but we must do it as they did, from the same principle of faith and devotion, and with the same sincerity and resolution.</body></html>
