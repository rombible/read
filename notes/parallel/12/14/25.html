Ewald remarks that the activity of this prophet must have occupied a very large field, as tradition connects him with Nineveh. Hitzig and Knobel recognise the prophecy referred to here in Isaiah 15, 16. There is no difficulty in the supposition that Isaiah has "adopted and ratified the work of an earlier prophet," as Jeremiah has so often done. (See Cheyne's <span class= "ital">Isaiah,</span> vol. i., p. 93.) But it is easier to prove that these chapters are not Isaiah's, than that they belong to Jonah.<p><span class= "bld">Gath-hepher.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-13.htm" title="And from there passes on along on the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goes out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;">Joshua 19:13</a>.

Hamath itself was between eighty and ninety miles further to the north, on the middle Orontes, about N. lat. 35&deg; 22'. The "entering in of Hamath" was always reckoned the northern boundary of the Holy Land (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>). It corresponded with the watershed between the Orontes and the Litany. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the sea of the plain.</span> The "sea of the plain" is undoubtedly the Dead Sea, the plain (<span class="accented">ha-Arabah</span>) being used as a sort of proper name for the lower Jordan valley, like <span class="accented">El</span>-<span class="accented">Ghor</span> at the present day (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>, etc.). The territory recovered no doubt included all the trans-Jordanic region as far south as the river Aruon; but the recovery of dominion over Moab, and even over Ammon, which some have seen in this passage (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 124), is scarcely con-rained in it. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>). Jonah's date is determined by this passage. He was contemporary with Hosea and Amos, and earlier than Micah. His prophecy concerning Jeroboam is probably assigned to the early part of that king's reign. <span class="cmt_word">The prophet, which was of Gath-hepher.</span> Gath-hepher is mentioned in Joshua, under the name of Gittah-hepher, as a city of Zebulon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>), not far from Mount Tabor. It is conjecturally identified with <span class="accented">El-Meshhed</span> north of Nazareth, where the tomb of Jonah is shown. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:23-29 God raised up the prophet Jonah, and by him declared the purposes of his favour to Israel. It is a sign that God has not cast off his people, if he continues faithful ministers among them. Two reasons are given why God blessed them with those victories: 1. Because the distress was very great, which made them objects of his compassion. 2. Because the decree was not yet gone forth for their destruction. Many prophets there had been in Israel, but none left prophecies in writing till this age, and their prophecies are part of the Bible. Hosea began to prophesy in the reign of this Jeroboam. At the same time Amos prophesied; soon after Micah, then Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah. Thus God, in the darkest and most degenerate ages of the church, raised up some to be burning and shining lights in it; to their own age, by their preaching and living, and a few by their writings, to reflect light upon us in the last times.</body></html>
