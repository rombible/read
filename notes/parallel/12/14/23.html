Seven verses only are devoted to him. The result of his wars is given without any account of the wars themselves.

Some suppose that Jeroboam was joint-king with his father in Amaziah's third year, solo king from his fifteenth. But it is better to acknowledge the general confusion of the chronology, and to regard it as uncertain, unless where a synchronism is distinctly made out. Such assured synchronisms are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The synchronism of Ahab with Jehoshaphat: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the synchronism of Jehoram, Ahab's son, with the same; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the synchronism of Jehu's first year with the first year of Athaliah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the synchronism of Amaziah with Joash of Israel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the synchronism of Pekah with Ahaz; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the synchronism of Hoshea's last year with Hezekiah's sixth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> the synchronism of Amaziah's fourteenth year with Jeroboam II.'s first, being twice asserted in two distinct forms (vers. 17 and 23), is, at any rate, highly probable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Numbers which occur once only in ancient writers can seldom be implicitly trusted, since the liability of numbers to corruption is excessive. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:23-29 God raised up the prophet Jonah, and by him declared the purposes of his favour to Israel. It is a sign that God has not cast off his people, if he continues faithful ministers among them. Two reasons are given why God blessed them with those victories: 1. Because the distress was very great, which made them objects of his compassion. 2. Because the decree was not yet gone forth for their destruction. Many prophets there had been in Israel, but none left prophecies in writing till this age, and their prophecies are part of the Bible. Hosea began to prophesy in the reign of this Jeroboam. At the same time Amos prophesied; soon after Micah, then Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah. Thus God, in the darkest and most degenerate ages of the church, raised up some to be burning and shining lights in it; to their own age, by their preaching and living, and a few by their writings, to reflect light upon us in the last times.</body></html>
