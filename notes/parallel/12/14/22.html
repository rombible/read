"Built," either <span class= "ital">rebuilt</span> or <span class= "ital">fortified.</span> The verse is in close connection with the preceding narrative. Amaziah perhaps had not vigorously prosecuted the conquest of Edom, having been greatly weakened by his defeat in the struggle with Jehoash. He may even have suffered some further losses at the hands of the Edomites; and this, as Thenius supposes may have led to the conspiracy which brought about his death and the accession of his son. The warlike youth Uzziah took the field at once, and pushed his victorious arms to the southern extremity of Edom, the port of Elath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm" title="Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD.

Thenius explains the verse with most success, but this clause is still somewhat surprising.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He built Elath, and restored it to Judah.</span> On the position of Elath, or Eloth, and its importance, see the comment on 1 Kings 9:26. It had been the headquarters of Solomon's fleet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), and again of Jehoshaphat's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>); but had been, of course, recovered by the Edomites when they revolted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>). Azariah's re-occupation seems to imply an intention on his part of, renewing the old Red Sea trade. By "built ' in this passage we must understand "rebuilt" or (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>) "fortified." <span class="cmt_word">After that the king slept with his fathers.</span> Keil is probably right in understanding this to mean "immediately after he had ascended the throne," or "as soon as ever his father was dead" (see the comment on ver. 19). His further military successes will be considered in the comment on his reign, as sketched in the next chapter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:15-22 Amaziah survived his conqueror fifteen years. He was slain by his own subjects. Azariah, or Uzziah, seems to have been very young when his father was slain. Though the years of his reign are reckoned from that event, he was not fully made king till eleven years afterwards.</body></html>
