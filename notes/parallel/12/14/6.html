The Syriac and Arabic have, "and was buried."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the children of the murderers he slew not.</span> It was the ordinary usage in the East for the sons of traitors to share the fate of their fathers. A Greek poet went so far as to say that a man was a fool who put to death the father, and allowed the son to live. The practice had a double ground. Sons, it might be assumed, would be cognizant of their father's intention, and would so be accessories before the fact. And the law of <span class="accented">claim</span>, or "blood-feud," would make it dangerous to spare them, since they would be bound to avenge their father's death on his destroyer. That the practice prevailed among the Israelites appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a>, where we find the children of Achan involved in his fate, and again from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>, where we are told that Naboth's sons suffered with their father. But it was contrary to an express command of the Law, as the writer goes on to show. <span class="cmt_word">According unto that which is written in the book of the Law of Moses.</span> "The book of the Law of Moses" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) may be either the Pentateuch regarded as one book, or Deuteronomy, the particular" book" of the Pentateuch in which the passage occurs. In either case the passage is fatal to the theory of the late' composition of Deuteronomy, which is here found to have ruled the conduct of a Jewish king a hundred and fifty years before Manasseh, two hundred before Josiah, and two hundred and eighty before the return from the Captivity - the dates assigned to Deuteronomy by recent "advanced" critics. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> As usual, when one sacred writer quotes another, the quotation is not exact. "But" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) is inserted at the beginning of the final clause, and the form of the verb in the same clause is modified. It seems to be intended that we should be made to feel that it is the sentiment or meaning conveyed, and not the phraseology in which it is wrapped up, that is of importance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-7 Amaziah began well, but did not go on so. It is not enough to do that which our pious predecessors did, merely to keep up the common usage, but we must do it as they did, from the same principle of faith and devotion, and with the same sincerity and resolution.</body></html>
