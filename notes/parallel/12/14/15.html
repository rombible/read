And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.</span> These verses are repeated with very slight alterations from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-11.htm">2 Kings 13:11, 12</a>. Curiously, on both occasions they are out of place. It is scarcely worth while to consider how they came into the text at this point, since no explanation could be more than a conjecture. In point of fact, they are redundant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:15-22 Amaziah survived his conqueror fifteen years. He was slain by his own subjects. Azariah, or Uzziah, seems to have been very young when his father was slain. Though the years of his reign are reckoned from that event, he was not fully made king till eleven years afterwards.</body></html>
