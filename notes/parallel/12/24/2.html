Whilst Nebuchadnezzar himself was engaged elsewhere in his great empire, predatory bands of Chaldeans, and of the neighbouring peoples the hereditary enemies of Judah, who had submitted to Nebuchadnezzar, and were nothing loth to make reprisals for the power which Josiah had, perhaps, exercised over them, ravaged the Judaean territory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/12-8.htm" title="My heritage is to me as a lion in the forest; it cries out against me: therefore have I hated it.">Jeremiah 12:8-17</a>, concerning Judah's "evil neighbours").<p><span class= "bld">According to the word of the Lord.</span>--Isaiah, Micah, Urijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-20.htm" title="And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.">Jeremiah 26:20</a>), Huldah, Jeremiah, Habakkuk, and doubtless others whose names and writings have not been transmitted, had foretold the fate that was now closing in upon Judah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldees.</span> That Nebuchadnezzar did not promptly march against Jehoiakim to suppress his rebellion, but contented himself with sending against him a few "bands" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) of Chaldeans, and exciting the neighboring Syrians, Ammonites, and Moabites to invade and ravage his territory, can scarcely be otherwise accounted for than by supposing that he was detained in Middle Asia by wars or rebellious nearer home.

See what need nations have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they smart for them. Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as promises, if the sinner's repentance prevent not.</body></html>
