Hitzig refers the passage to Zedekiah; and so Thenius. Josephus calls Jehoiachin "naturally good and just;" probably misunderstanding the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm" title="As I live, said the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I pluck you there;">Jeremiah 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father had done</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-37.htm">2 Kings 23:37</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>). Josephus says that Jehoiachin was <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ('Ant.

The present passage probably does not mean more than that he made no attempt at a religious reformation, but allowed the idolatries and superstitions which had prevailed under Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim to continue. It is in his favor that he did not actively persecute Jeremiah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-20 Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.</body></html>
