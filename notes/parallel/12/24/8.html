Four or five different forms of this name occur in the documents. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a> gives the contraction <span class= "ital">Joiachin</span>. In Jeremiah we find a popular transposition of the two elements, thus: <span class= "ital">Jechonjahu</span> (once, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1</a>, <span class= "ital">Heb</span>.), and usually the shorter form, Jechoniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-20.htm" title="Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 27:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-6.htm" title="Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.">Esther 2:6</a>); which is further abridged into Coniah (Heb., <span class= "ital">Chonjahu</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm" title="As I live, said the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I pluck you there;">Jeremiah 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>. Ewald thinks this last the original name; but Hengstenberg supposes that the prophet altered the name, so as to make of it a "Jah will confirm" without the "will," in order to foreshadow the fate which awaited this king.<p><span class= "bld">Nehushta.</span>--Referring, perhaps, to her complexion (as we say "bronzed").<p><span class= "bld">Elnathan.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm" title="And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.">Jeremiah 26:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm" title="Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.">Jeremiah 36:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a>; one of Jehoiakim's "princes."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-16</span> - REIGN OF JEHOIACHIN. The short reign of Jehoisshin is now described. It lasted but three months. For some reason which is unrecorded, Nebuchadnezzar, who had placed him on the throne, took offence at his conduct, and sent an army against him to effect his deposition. Jehoiachin offered scarcely any resistance. He "went out" of the city (ver. 12), with the queen-mother, the officers of the court, and the princes, and submitted himself to the will of the great king. But he gained nothing by his pusillanimity. The Babylonians entered Jerusalem, plundered the temple and the royal palace, made prisoners of the king, his mother, the princes and nobles, the armed garrison, and all the more skilled artisans, to the number altogether of ten thousand souls (Josephus says 10,832, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 1), and carried them captive to Babylon. Zedekiah, the king's uncle, was made monarch in his room. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> he is said to have been only eight years old, but this is probably an accidental corruption, the <span class="accented">yod</span>, which is the Hebrew sign for ten, easily slipping out. As he had "wives" (ver. 15) and "seed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>), he could not well be less than eighteen. <span class="cmt_word">And he reigned in Jerusalem three months.</span> "Three months and ten days," according to 2 Chronicles (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) and Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' <span class="accented">l</span>.<span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">c</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.</span> Elnathan was one of the chief of the Jerusalem princes under Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12, 25</a>). His daughter, Nehushta - the Noste of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3) - was probably the ruling spirit of the time during her son's short reign. We find mention of her in Jeremiah 26:26; 29:2; and in Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3, and Jeremiah 10:7. &sect; 1. Ewald suggests that she "energetically supported" her son in the policy whereby he offended Nebuchadnezzar. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-20 Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.</body></html>
