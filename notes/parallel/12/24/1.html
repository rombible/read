According to Berosus, he was not at the time of this expedition the actual sovereign of Babylonia, but only the crown prince, placed by the actual king, Nabopolassar, at the head of his army. It is possible that his father may have associated him in the kingdom, for association was not unknown at Babylon; or the Jews may have mistaken his position; or the historian may call him king by <span class="accented">prolepsis</span>, as a modern might say, "The Emperor Napoleon invaded Italy and defeated the Austrians at Marengo" (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 400). His father had grown too old and infirm to conduct a military expedition, and consequently sent his son in his place, with the object of chastising Nechoh, and recovering the territory whereof Nechoh had made himself master three years before (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-33</a>, and compare below, ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiakim became his servant</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> submitted to him, and became a tributary king - <span class="cmt_word">three years</span> (from <span class="date">B.C. 605</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 602</span>): <span class="cmt_word">then he turned and rebelled against him.</span> How Jehoiakim came to venture on this step we are not told, and can only conjecture. It is, perhaps, most probable that (as Josephus says, 'Ant. Jud.' 10:6, &sect; 2) he was incited to take this course by the Egyptians, who were still under the rule of the brave and enterprising Nechoh, and who may have hoped to wipe out by fresh victories the disaster experienced at Carehemish. There is, perhaps, an allusion to Jehoiakim's expectation of Egyptian succors in the statement of ver. 7, that "the King of Egypt came not again any more out of his land." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-7 If Jehoiakim had served the Lord, he had not been servant to Nebuchadnezzar. If he had been content with his servitude, and true to his word, his condition had been no worse; but, rebelling against Babylon, he plunged himself into more trouble. See what need nations have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they smart for them. Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as promises, if the sinner's repentance prevent not.</body></html>
