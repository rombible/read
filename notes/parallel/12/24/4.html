an expression like <span class= "ital">hand of the right, i.e.</span>, the right hand; or, <span class= "ital">day of the sixth, i.e.</span>, the sixth day. Thenius thinks the murder of some prominent personage, such as Isaiah, may be intended, and wishes to distinguish between the statement of the first clause of the verse and the second; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm" title="Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.">2Kings 21:16</a>, where the two statements are connected more closely, does not favour this view.<p><span class= "bld">Which the Lord would not pardon.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and Jehovah willed not to pardon</span>. We must not soften the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/24-3.htm" title="Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;">2Kings 24:3-4</a>, as Bahr does, by asserting the meaning to be that the nation was punished, not for the sins of Manasseh, but for its persistence in the same kind of sins. The sins of Manasseh are regarded as a climax in Judah's long course of provocation: the cup was full, and judgment ready to fall. It was only suspended for a time, not revoked, in the reign of the good king Josiah. In short, the idea of the writer is that the innocent blood shed by Manasseh cried to heaven for vengeance, and that the ruin of the kingdom was the answer of the All righteous Judge. It is no objection to say, that in that case children suffered for their fathers' misdeeds; that was precisely the Old Testament doctrine, until Ezekiel proclaimed another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-19.htm" title="Yet say you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father?

Looking at the catastrophe from a different standpoint, <span class= "ital">we</span> may remember that national iniquities must be chastised in the present life, if at all; and that the sufferings of the exile were necessary for the purification of Israel from its inveterate tendency to apostatise from Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And also for the innocent blood that he shed</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). Like the other "sins of Manasseh," the shedding of innocent blood continued, both in the Moloch offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>) and in the persecution of the righteous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6, 9</a>, etc.). Urijah was actually put to death by Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>); Jeremiah narrowly escaped. <span class="cmt_word">For he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the Lord would not pardon.</span> Blood "cries to God from the ground" on which it falls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a>), and is "required" at the hands of the bloodshedder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>) unfailingly. Especially is the blood of saints slain for their religion avenged and exacted by the Most High (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-7 If Jehoiakim had served the Lord, he had not been servant to Nebuchadnezzar. If he had been content with his servitude, and true to his word, his condition had been no worse; but, rebelling against Babylon, he plunged himself into more trouble. See what need nations have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they smart for them. Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as promises, if the sinner's repentance prevent not.</body></html>
