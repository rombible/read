(See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm" title="And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus said the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:">Jeremiah 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/37-1.htm" title="And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.">Jeremiah 37:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-5.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.">Jeremiah 38:5</a>, and Comp.

The contemporary state of religion is vividly reflected in the pages of Ezekiel (2Kings viii--11); who, moreover, denounces Zedekiah's breach of faith with the king of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 17:11-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">According to all that Jehoiakim</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--He is not compared with Jehoiachin, who only reigned three months.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span> Keil says, "His attitude towards the Lord exactly resembled that of his brother Jehoiakim, except that Zedekiah does not appear to have possessed so much energy for that which was evil." He allowed the people to continue their "pollutions" and" abominations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). He let the "princes" have their way, and do whatever they pleased (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-5.htm">Jeremiah 38:5</a>), contenting himself with sometimes outwitting them, and counteracting their proceeding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14-28</a>). He fell into the old error of "putting trust in Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-7</a>), and made an alliance with Apries (Pharaoh-Hophra), which was an act of rebellion, at once against God and against his Babylonian suzerain. He was, upon the whole, rather weak than wicked; but his weakness was as ruinous to his country as active wickedness would have been. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-20 Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.</body></html>
