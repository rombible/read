Thenius and Bahr prefer to understand the men of property and the artisans, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm" title="And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.">2Kings 15:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">All the craftsmen and smiths.</span>--The former were workers in wood, stone, and metal, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, carpenters, masons, and smiths. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm" title="And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.">Genesis 4:22</a>.) The "smiths" (properly, "they who shut") answer to what we should call locksmiths. They were makers of bolts and bars for doors and gates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm" title="(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)">Jeremiah 29:2</a>). It is obvious that by deporting "the craftsmen and smiths" the king of Babylon made further outbreaks impossible (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm" title="Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:">1Samuel 13:19</a>.) Kimchi's explanation of "smiths" is a curiosity of exegesis. He makes of them "learned persons, who <span class= "ital">shut other people's mouths,</span> and propose riddles which nobody else can guess." Hitzig and Thenius derive the word (<span class= "ital">masg?r</span>) from <span class= "ital">mas, </span>"levy," and <span class= "ital">g?r, </span>"alien," so that it would originally mean "statute labourers," "Canaanites compelled to work for the king;" and afterwards, as here, "manual labourers" in general. But such a compound term in Hebrew would be very surprising.<p><span class= "bld">The poorest sort.</span>--Those who had neither property nor handicraft. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm" title="But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.">Jeremiah 39:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he carried away all Jerusalem.</span> The expression has to be limited by what follows. "All Jerusalem" means all that was important in the population of Jerusalem all the upper classes, the "princes" and "nobles," all the men trained to the use of arms, and all the skilled craftsmen and artisans of the city. The poor and weak and unskilled were left. The number deported, according to our author, was either ten or eleven thousand. The whole population of the ancient city has been calculated from its area at fifteen thousand. The largest estimate of the population of the modern city is seventeen thousand. <span class="cmt_word">And all the princes.</span> The <span class="accented">sarim</span>, or "princes," are not males of the blood royal, but the nobles, or upper classes of Jerusalem (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10-16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And all the mighty men of valor</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the trained troops" (Ewald); not "all the men of wealth," as Bahr renders - <span class="cmt_word">even ten thousand captives.</span> As the soldiers are reckoned below (ver. 16) at seven thousand, and the craftsmen at one thousand, the upper-class captives would seem to have been two thousand; unless, indeed, the "craftsmen" are additional to the ten thousand, in which Case the upper-class captives would have numbered three thousand, and the prisoners have amounted altogether to eleven thousand. <span class="cmt_word">And all the craftsmen and smiths.</span> Ewald understands "the <span class="accented">military</span> workmen and siege engineers" to be intended ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 263, note 9); but the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>in Hebrew includes all workers in stone, metal, or wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-12.htm">Isaiah 44:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>), and there is nothing to limit it here to <span class="accented">military</span> craftsmen. It was an Oriental practice to weaken a state by the deportation of all the stronger elements of its population. <span class="cmt_word">None remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.</span> These words must be taken with some latitude. There are still "princes" in Jerusalem under Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4, 25, 27</a>), and courtiers of rank (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>), and "captains of forces" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>), and "men of war" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>). But the bulk of the inhabitants now left behind in Jerusalem were poor and of small account. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-20 Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.</body></html>
