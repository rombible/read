As W. G. Sumner well observes, "The sins of Manasseh had become a designation for a certain class of offences, and a particular form of public and social depravity, which was introduced by Manassseh, but of which generation after generation continued to be guilty." The special sins were <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> idolatry, accompanied by licentious rites; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> child-murder, or sacrifice to Moloch; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> sodomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the use of enchantments and the practice of magical arts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-7 If Jehoiakim had served the Lord, he had not been servant to Nebuchadnezzar. If he had been content with his servitude, and true to his word, his condition had been no worse; but, rebelling against Babylon, he plunged himself into more trouble. See what need nations have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they smart for them. Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as promises, if the sinner's repentance prevent not.</body></html>
