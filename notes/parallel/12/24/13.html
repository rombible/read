A beginning had been made of the carrying off the sacred vessels of the temple in Jehoiakim's third (fourth?) year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>), which was the first of Nebuchadnezzar. The plundering was now carried a step further; while the final complete sweep of all that remained came eleven years later, at the end of the reign of Zedekiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the treasures of the king's house</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-13.htm">2 Kings 20:13</a>). If the treasures which Hezekiah showed to the envoys of Merodach-Baladan were carried off by Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>), still there had probably been fresh accumulations made during their long reigns by Manasseh and Josiah. <span class="cmt_word">And out in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon King of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord.</span> (For an account of these vessels, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45-50</a>.) They consisted in part of articles of furniture, like the altar of incense and the table of shrewbread, which were thickly covered with plates of gold; in part of vessels, etc., made wholly of the precious metal, as candlesticks, or rather candelabra, snuffers, tongs, basins, spoons, censers, and the like. <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord had said</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-17.htm">2 Kings 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-5.htm">Jeremiah 20:5</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:8-20 Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.</body></html>
