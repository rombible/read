He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem"(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit on the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.">Jeremiah 36:30</a>). Jehoiakim appears to have been slain in an encounter with the bauds of freebooters mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm" title="And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.">2Kings 24:2</a>, so that his body was left to decay where it fell, all his followers having perished with him. Ewald supposes that he was lured out of Jerusalem to a pretended conference with the Chaldeans, and then treacherously seized, and, as he proved a refractory prisoner, slain, and his body denied the last honours, his family craving its restoration in vain. (The words of the text do not necessarily imply <span class= "ital">a natural and peaceful</span> death, as Thenius alleges, but simply <span class= "ital">death</span> without further qualification.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers.</span> It is not certain that the writer means anything more by this than that "Jehoiakim died." His body may, however, possibly have been found by the Jews after the Babylonians had withdrawn from before Jerusalem, and have been entombed with those of Manasseh, Amen, and Josiah. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead, Josephus says</span> (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) that Nebuchadnezzar placed him upon the throne, which is likely enough, since he would certainly not have quitted Jerusalem without setting up some king or other. Jehoiachin has in Scripture the two other names of Jeconiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-20.htm">Jeremiah 27:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>) and Coniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>). Jehoiachin and Jeconiah differ only, as Jehoahaz and Ahaziah, by a reversal of the order of the two elements. Both mean "Jehovah will establish (him)." "Conlah" cuts off from "Jeconiah" the sign of futurity, and means "Jehovah establishes." It is used only by Jeremiah, and seems used by him to signify that though "Jehovah establishes," Jeconiah he would <span class="accented">not</span> establish. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-7 If Jehoiakim had served the Lord, he had not been servant to Nebuchadnezzar. If he had been content with his servitude, and true to his word, his condition had been no worse; but, rebelling against Babylon, he plunged himself into more trouble. See what need nations have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they smart for them. Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as promises, if the sinner's repentance prevent not.</body></html>
