Thenius concludes from the words, "that he may set his nest on high," &c., that Jehoiakim strengthened and enlarged the fortress on Ophel erected by Manasseh.

How Nebuchadnezzar treated him is uncertain. Josephus says ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3) that he put him to death, and east him out unburied beyond the walls of the city. But from the biblical notices we can only gather that he died prematurely after a reign of no more than eleven years ( <span class="date">B.C. 608</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 597</span>), and was u-lamented, "buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18, 19</a>). Conjecture has filled up the blanks of this history in several ways, the most purely imaginative being, perhaps, that of Ewald, who says ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 262), "When the Chaldean armies presented themselves at the gates of the capital, Jehoiakim seems to have been betrayed into the same error as his brother (Jehoahaz), eleven years before. He gave ear to a crafty invitation of the enemy to repair for negotiations to their camp, where, in sight of his own city, he was made prisoner. He offered a frantic resistance, and was dragged away in a scuffle, and miserably cut down; while even an honorable burial for his corpse, which his family certainly solicited, was refused." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-7 If Jehoiakim had served the Lord, he had not been servant to Nebuchadnezzar. If he had been content with his servitude, and true to his word, his condition had been no worse; but, rebelling against Babylon, he plunged himself into more trouble. See what need nations have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they smart for them. Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as promises, if the sinner's repentance prevent not.</body></html>
