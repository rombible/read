The approach of Tiglath Pileser compelled the two kings to give up their enterprise, and hasten to defend their own frontiers.<p><span class= "bld">Recovered Elath to Syria . . . the Syrians.</span>--The words for <span class= "ital">Syria</span> and <span class= "ital">Edom, Syrians</span> and <span class= "ital">Edomties,</span> are very much alike in Hebrew writing, and the Hebrew margin, many MSS., the LXX. and Vulg. read <span class= "ital">Edomites</span> for <span class= "ital">Syrians</span> here. If this be correct, we must also restore <span class= "ital">Edom</span> for <span class= "ital">Syria,</span> as many critics propose. The meaning then becomes this: Rezin emancipated the Edomites from the yoke of Judah imposed on them by Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm" title="He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.">2Kings 14:22</a>) in order to win their active co-operation against Judah. Bahr, however, prefers the readings of the ordinary text, and supposes that Rezin simply expelled the Jews from Elath, and established there a commercial colony of Syrians.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time Rezin, King of Syria recovered Elath to Syria.</span> The Syrians had certainly never previously been masters of Elath, which had always hitherto been either Jewish or Edomite (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>). Hence it seems to be necessary that we should either translate the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span> by "gained," "conquered," instead of "recovered;" or else change <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, "Syria," into <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5dd;</span> "Edom." The Syrians could "recover" Elath for Edom; they could only "gain" it for themselves. <span class="cmt_word">And drave the Jews from Elath</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> expelled the Jewish garrison which had been maintained in Elath from the time of its conquest by Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and the Syrians came to Elath</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Edomites -</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Rezin could not have thought of holding a place so remote from Damascus as Elath; and, had he done so, the danger of his kingdom in the next year would have necessitated the relinquishment of so distant a possession. <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt there unto this day.</span> It is quite certain that Elath belonged to Edom, and not to Syria, at the time when the Books of Kings were written. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 Few and evil were the days of Ahaz. Those whose hearts condemn them, will go any where in a day of distress, rather than to God. The sin was its own punishment. It is common for those who bring themselves into straits by one sin, to try to help themselves out by another.</body></html>
