So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.">1Kings 12:32-33</a>.) It thus appears that Ahaz, like Uzziah, personally exercised the priestly function of sacrifice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.</span> It is not necessarily implied in these words that Ahaz, like Uzziah, usurped the priestly functions, though conceivably he may have done so, and Urijah may have stood tamely by. What the writer has it in his mind to record is that the king, on his return from Damascus, at once made use of the new' altar for his private sacrifices. If he had meant to tax Ahaz with so great a sin as that which brought the curse of leprosy upon Uzziah, he would almost certainly have made his meaning clearer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:10-16 God's altar had hitherto been kept in its place, and in use; but Ahaz put another in the room of it. The natural regard of the mind of man to some sort of religion, is not easily extinguished; but except it be regulated by the word, and by the Spirit of God, it produces absurd superstitions, or detestable idolatries. Or, at best, it quiets the sinner's conscience with unmeaning ceremonies. Infidels have often been remarkable for believing ridiculous falsehoods.</body></html>
