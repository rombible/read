Among them are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The complete defeat of Ahaz by Pekah, who "smote him with a great slaughter" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5</a>), killing a hundred and twenty thousand of his soldiers, and carrying Off two hundred thousand captives, men, women, and children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-8.htm">2 Chronicles 28:8</a>); these captives were, however, afterwards restored (ver. 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> His defeat by the Syrians (ver. 5). This is, perhaps, implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>; but it is not expressly stated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> His defeat by the Edomites, who invaded his land, and made a largo number of prisoners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The conquest in his reign of a considerable portion of Southern Judaea by the Philistines (ver. 18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The fact that Ahaz at one time in his life adopted the Syrian worship, and "sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which smote him" (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The fact that in his latter years he shut up the temple (ver. 24), closing the doors of the porch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>), extinguishing the lamps (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>), and putting an end to the burning of incense and the offering of sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The fact that, not content with the previously existing high places, he set up a number of new ones, so that there should be a "high place" in every several city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-25.htm">2 Chronicles 28:25</a>). The religious condition of Judaea can scarcely have been worse in the worst time of Manasseh or Amon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:17-20 Ahaz put contempt upon the sabbath, and thus opened a wide inlet to all manner of sin. This he did for the king of Assyria. When those who have had a ready passage to the house of the Lord, turn it another way to please their neighbours, they are going down-hill apace to ruin.</body></html>
