"Jotham, the last of a series of strong and generally successful princes, had died at a critical moment, when Pekah and Rezin were maturing their plans against his kingdom. The opposing parties in northern Israel suspended their feuds to make common cause against Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-21.htm" title="Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:21</a>), and the proud inhabitants of Samaria hoped by this policy to more than restore the prestige forfeited in previous years of calamity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-9.htm" title="And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,">Isaiah 9:9-10</a>). At the same time the Syrians began to operate in the eastern dependencies of Judah, their aim being to possess themselves of the harbour of Elath on the Red Sea, while the Philistines attacked the Judeans in the rear, and ravaged the fertile lowlands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-12.htm" title="The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm" title="At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelled there to this day.">2Kings 16:6</a>). A heavy and sudden disaster had already fallen on the Judean arms, a defeat in which 'head and tail, palm-branch and rush' had been mown down in indiscriminate slaughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-14.htm" title="Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.">Isaiah 9:14</a>). Ahaz was no fit leader in so critical a time; his character was petulant and childish, his policy was dictated in the harem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm" title="As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths.">Isaiah 3:12</a>). Nor was the internal order of the state calculated to inspire confidence. Wealth, indeed, had greatly accumulated in the preceding time of prosperity, but its distribution had been such that it weakened rather than added strength to the nation. The rich nobles were steeped in sensual luxury, the court was full of gallantry, feminine extravagance and vanity gave the tone to aristocratic society (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm" title="Woe to them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!">Isaiah 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:">Isaiah 3:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm" title="As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.

It began, apparently, in the reign of Jotham. The policy which brought it about was one that was entirely new. Since Syria developed an aggressive tendency under the first Ben-hadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), there had till now been no alliance made with her by either of the two Israelite kingdoms. She had been reckoned as their common enemy; and while they had on two occasions been allied together against her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28</a>), never as yet had either asked her help against the other. Now, however, Ephraim became confederate with Syria against Judah. The new policy must be ascribed to the new condition of things consequent upon the attitude assumed by Assyria under Tiglath-pileser. Assyria had been under a cloud for forty years. The nations of the western coast of Asia had ceased to fear her, and had felt at liberty to pursue their own quarrels. Her recovery of vigor altered the whole situation. It was at once evident to the statesmen who directed the policy of the small western states that, unless they combined; they were lost. Hence the alliance between Pekah and Rezin. Probably they would have been glad to have drawn Ahaz into the confederacy; but it would seem that he did not share their fears, and would not join them. Hereupon the design was formed to dethrone him, and set up in his place a new ruler, a certain Ben-Tabeal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>), on whose assistance they could rely. The two confederate princes then began the campaign. Pekah invaded Judaea, and gained a great victory over Ahaz, which is perhaps exaggerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-15</a>; Rezin carried his arms further south, took Elath, and reestablished the Edomites in power (see the comment on ver. 6). Then the allies joined forces and proceeded to besiege Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And they besieged Ahaz,</span> but could not ever-come him. The siege is mentioned by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>, who was commissioned by God to comfort Ahaz, and assure him that the city would not fall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-7.htm">Isaiah 7:7</a>). The fortifications of Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>) and Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) had, no doubt, greatly strengthened the city since the time when (as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>) it was captured so easily by Joash. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 Few and evil were the days of Ahaz. Those whose hearts condemn them, will go any where in a day of distress, rather than to God. The sin was its own punishment. It is common for those who bring themselves into straits by one sin, to try to help themselves out by another.</body></html>
