Ahaz spoiled the Temple of its ornamental work, not out of wanton malice, but from dire necessity. He had to provide a present <span class= "ital">for the king of Assyria.</span> Thus these verses are really a continuation of the first statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10</a>. They inform us how Ahaz managed not to appear empty-handed at Damascus. (So Thenius.) Prof. R. Smith says: "Ahaz, whose treasures had been exhausted by his first tribute, was soon driven by the repeated demands of his masters to strip the Temple even of its ancient bronze-work and other fixed ornaments. The incidental mention of this fact in a fragment of the history of the Temple incorporated in the Book of Kings is sufficient evidence of the straits to which the kingdom of Judah was reduced."<p><span class= "bld">Borders of the bases.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-28.htm" title="And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:">1Kings 7:28</a>. Thenius thinks Ahaz replaced them with unadorned plates, and set the laver up in a different fashion; but the text does not <span class= "ital">say</span> so. (Comp., however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2Kings 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm" title="The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.">2Kings 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm" title="Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The brasen oxen.</span>--These were ultimately carried off by the Babylonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm" title="The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.">Jeremiah 52:20</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A pavement of stones</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a pedestal or foundation of stonework: <span class= "greekheb">??? ????? ???????</span> (LXX.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases.</span> By "the bases" are probably meant the stands of the ten brazen layers, which Hiram the Tyrian artificer made for Solomon, and which Solomon placed outside the temple, five on either side of the entrance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-39.htm">1 Kings 7:39</a>). The "borders of the bases" seem to have consisted of ornamental panels, on which were carved, in relief, figures of lions, oxen, and cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-29.htm">1 Kings 7:29</a>), The object of Ahaz in these mutilations may have been merely destructive, as we find Egyptian kings, after a change of religion, mutilating the tablets, and erasing the inscriptions put up in honor of those gods who had ceased to be in favor with them. Or, possibly, he may, as Keil supposes, have wished to transfer the ornamental carvings to some other edifice, e.g. an idolatrous temple or a palace. <span class="cmt_word">And removed the laver from off them</span> - removed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from each base "the laver" which stood upon it - <span class="cmt_word">and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it.</span> (On Solomon's "molten sea," or great laver, and the twelve oxen which supported it, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>.)

This he did for the king of Assyria. When those who have had a ready passage to the house of the Lord, turn it another way to please their neighbours, they are going down-hill apace to ruin.</body></html>
