and put it at the side of the</span> (new) <span class= "ital">altar northward.</span> The brasen altar used to stand "before the Lord," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the middle of the court of the priests, and in front of the Temple proper. The verse seems to imply that Urijah had pushed it forward nearer to the sanctuary, and set the new Syrian altar in its place. Ahaz, not satisfied with this arrangement, which appeared to confer a kind of precedence on the old altar, drew it back again, and fixed it on the north side of his new altar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he brought also the brazen altar, which was before the Lord.</span> One sin leads on to another. Having introduced his self-invented <span class="accented">quasi-idolatrous</span> altar into the temple, and so inserted "the thin end of the wedge," Ahaz was not satisfied, but proceeded to another innovation. Urijah, having had no express order from the king with respect to the position of the new altar, had placed it in front of the old one, between it and the eastern gate of the court. Thus the old altar, which was directly in front of the temple porch, seemed to cut the new altar off from the temple. Ahaz would not have this continue, and resolved on removing the altar of Solomon from, its place, and putting it elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">From the forefront of the house</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a>), <span class="cmt_word">from between the altar</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the new altar - <span class="cmt_word">and the house of the Lord</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the temple building - <span class="cmt_word">and put it on the north side of the altar.</span> The removal of Solomon's altar from its place of honor to a side position left the space clear between the temple and the new altar, which thus, without exactly occupying the same site, took practically the place of Solomon's altar. Solomon's altar, shifted to one side, was put, as it were, in the background; the eye rested on the new altar, right in front of the porch and temple, which so became "the main altar" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>), as it is called in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:10-16 God's altar had hitherto been kept in its place, and in use; but Ahaz put another in the room of it. The natural regard of the mind of man to some sort of religion, is not easily extinguished; but except it be regulated by the word, and by the Spirit of God, it produces absurd superstitions, or detestable idolatries. Or, at best, it quiets the sinner's conscience with unmeaning ceremonies. Infidels have often been remarkable for believing ridiculous falsehoods.</body></html>
