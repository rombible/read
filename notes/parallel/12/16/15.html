(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.">Exodus 29:38-42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/28-3.htm" title="And you shall say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.">Numbers 28:3-8</a>.) The morning meat offering is implied in the mention of the burnt offering, because no burnt offering was offered without one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-87.htm" title="All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat offering: and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve.">Numbers 7:87</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/15-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,">Numbers 15:2-12</a>). On the other hand, the evening meat offering was the only part of the evening sacrifice which the congregation could stay out, for the burnt offering had to burn all the night through (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm" title="Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning on the altar all night to the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.">Leviticus 6:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The brasen altar.</span>--The contrast seems to imply that the new altar was of a different material.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be for me to enquire by</span>--i.e., for consulting God. So Rashi. Others (as Keil): "I will think about what to do with it." Perhaps it is simply, "It shall be for me to look at," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an ornamental duplicate of the other altar. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm" title="One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.">Psalm 27:4</a>.) Gratz suggests "to draw near" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to sacrifice), transposing the last two letters of the verb, which does not suit the context; and Thenius would read, "to seek," after the Syriac, which has "to ask" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to pray), as if the old altar of sacrifice were henceforth to be an altar of prayer.

As, by the king's directions, all the regular and all the occasional sacrifices were to be offered upon his new altar, the other would practically be superfluous. It would have been only logical to remove it, or break it up; but this the king was probably afraid of doing. He therefore said that he would take time to consider what he should do. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:10-16 God's altar had hitherto been kept in its place, and in use; but Ahaz put another in the room of it. The natural regard of the mind of man to some sort of religion, is not easily extinguished; but except it be regulated by the word, and by the Spirit of God, it produces absurd superstitions, or detestable idolatries. Or, at best, it quiets the sinner's conscience with unmeaning ceremonies. Infidels have often been remarkable for believing ridiculous falsehoods.</body></html>
