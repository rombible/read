(<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> <span class="accented">- Expedition of Tiglath-pileser against Pekah and Rezin</span>. In the extremity of his danger, when the confederacy had declared itself, or perhaps later, when he had suffered terrible defeats, and was about. to be besieged in his capital (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5, 6</a>), Ahaz invoked the aid of Tiglath-pileser, sent him all the treasure on which he could lay his hands (ver. 8), offered to place himself and his kingdom under the Assyrian monarch's suzerainty, and entreated him to come and "save him out of the hands" of his enemies (ver. 7). Humanly speaking, he might be justified. He had not called in one foreign power until Pekah had called in another. There was no other prospect (again humanly speaking) of escape. But, had he accepted the offers of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4-16</a>, and relied wholly on Jehovah, his position would have been far better. However, he was unable to see this; he made his application; and Tiglath-pileser "came up," and utterly crushed the Syro-Israelite confederacy (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, saying.</span> This appeal to man rather than to God, this trust in "an arm of flesh," was exactly what Isaiah had been endeavoring to prevent, what he viewed as unfaithfulness, and as inevitably drawing down God's wrath both upon king and kingdom. Ahaz was young, was weak, and had no doubt a large body of advisers, who considered the prophet to be a fanatic, who had no belief in supernatural aid, and who thought that in any emergency recourse was to be had to the measures which human prudence and human policy dictated. The aid of Tiglath-pileser seemed to them, under the circumstances, the only thing that could save them; and they persuaded the weak prince to adopt their views. <span class="cmt_word">I am thy servant and thy son.</span> The offer of submission was unmistakable. "Servant," in the language of the time, meant "slave." Complete subjection, enrollment among Assyria's feudatories, the entire loss of independence, was well understood to be the price that had to be paid for Assyria's protection. Ahaz and his worldly advisers were prepared to pay it. They surrendered themselves, body and soul, into the hands of the great world-power of the period. <span class="cmt_word">Come up, and save me out of the hand of the King of Syria, and out of the hand of the King of Israel, which rise up against me.</span> Syria is put forward as at once the more formidable of the two foes, and the one most open to Assyrian attack. Already Damascus had been more than once menaced by Assyrian armies ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 113, 115, 116), while the kingdom of Samaria had only suffered at her extremities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). Samaria could not well be approached excepting through Syria, and after Syria's downfall. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 Few and evil were the days of Ahaz. Those whose hearts condemn them, will go any where in a day of distress, rather than to God. The sin was its own punishment. It is common for those who bring themselves into straits by one sin, to try to help themselves out by another.</body></html>
