It was only after Tiglath had settled matters with the northern kingdom, and so isolated Damascus, that he turned his arms against Rezin. Two whole years were spent in reducing him (733-732 B.C. ) In an inscription dating from his seventeenth year, Tiglath Pileser mentions that he received tribute from Eniel, king of Hamath, Muthumbaal, king of Arvad, Sanibu of Ammon, Salamanu of Moab, Mitinti of Asca-lon, Jahuhazi (Jehoahaz, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Ahaz) of Judah, Qausmalaka of Edom, Hanun of Gaza, and other princes. This probably relates to the expedition of 734 B.C. , in which year, therefore, Ahaz (Jehoahaz) must have put himself under the protection of Assyria (Schrader, <span class= "ital">K.A.T.,</span> p. 257 <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.</span> Hitherto the temple treasures had been diverted from their proper use, and secularized for the sole purpose (except in one instance) of buying off the hostility of foreign foe, who threatened the city and the temple itself with destruction (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>). Now, as on <span class="accented">one</span> former occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), they were utilized to purchase an alliance. <span class="cmt_word">And sent it for a present to the King of Assyria.</span> So Gyges King of Syria sent presents to Asshur-bani-pal to purchase his aid against the Cimmerians ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 68), and Susub of Babylon sent his temple treasures to Umman-Minan of Elam (ibid., pp. 46, 47), to purchase his assistance against Sennacherib. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 Few and evil were the days of Ahaz. Those whose hearts condemn them, will go any where in a day of distress, rather than to God. The sin was its own punishment. It is common for those who bring themselves into straits by one sin, to try to help themselves out by another.</body></html>
