The leader of the movement was Johanan, the son of Careah. Having first attacked Ishmael, and forced him to fly to the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-15.htm">Jeremiah 41:15</a>), he almost immediately afterwards conceived a fear of Nebuchadnezzar, who would, he thought, resent the murder of Gedaliah, and even avenge it upon these who had done all they could to prevent it. He therefore gathered together the people, and made a preliminary retreat to Chimham, near Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a>), on the road to Egypt, whence he subsequently, against the earnest remonstrances and prophetic warnings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9-22</a>, carried them on into Egypt itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-1.htm">Jeremiah 43:1-7</a>). The first settle-merit was made at Tahpanhes, or Daphnae. <span class="cmt_word">Arose, and came into Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-18.htm">Jeremiah 41:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-3.htm">Jeremiah 43:3</a>). There does not appear to have been any real reason for this fear. Nebuchadnezzar might have been trusted to distinguish between the act of an individual and conspiracy on the part of the nation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:22-30 The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore. Sin alone can hurt us; Jesus alone can do good to sinners.</body></html>
