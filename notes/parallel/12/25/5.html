The part west of Jordan was called the "plains" (<span class= "ital">Arboth</span> plural of <span class= "ital">Arabah</span>) of Jericho; and that which lay east of the river was known as the plains of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm" title="About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.">Joshua 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-1.htm" title="And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.">Numbers 22:1</a>).

The commanders at Jerusalem would fuel this the more sensibly, since Nebuchadnezzar had for some time retired from the siege, and left its conduct to them, while he himself exercised a general superintendence over military affairs from Riblah (see ver. 6). They were liable to be held responsible for the escape. <span class="cmt_word">And overtook him in the plains of Jericho.</span> The "plains of Jericho" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>) is the fertile tract on the right bank of the Jordan near its embouchure, which was excellently watered, and cultivated in gardens, orchards, and palm-groves. It is probable, though not certain, that Zedekiah intended to cross the Jordan, and seek a refuge in Moab. <span class="cmt_word">And all his army were scattered from him</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>). This seems to be mentioned in order to account for there being no engagement. Perhaps, thinking themselves in security, and imagining that they were not followed, the troops had dispersed themselves among the farmhouses and homesteads, to obtain a much-needed refreshment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.</body></html>
