Josephus adds that he was a wicked and most crafty man, who, during the siege of Jerusalem, had made his escape from the place, and fled for shelter to Baalim (Baalis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-14.htm">Jeremiah 40:14</a>), King of Ammon, with whom he remained till the siege was over. <span class="cmt_word">Came, and ten men with him</span> - as his retinue - <span class="cmt_word">and smote Gedaliah, that he died.</span> Gedaliah had been warned by Johanan and the other captains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-13.htm">Jeremiah 40:13-15</a>) of Ishmael's probable intentions, but had treated the accusation as a calumny, and refused to believe that his life was in any danger. When Ishmael and his ten companions arrived, he still suspected nothing, but received them hospitably (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1</a>), entertained them at a grand banquet, according to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:9. &sect; 4), and being overtaken with drunkenness, was attacked and killed without difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">And the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-3.htm">Jeremiah 41:3</a>, "Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found them, and the men of war"). It is evident from this that Gedaliah had a Chaldean guard. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:22-30 The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore. Sin alone can hurt us; Jesus alone can do good to sinners.</body></html>
