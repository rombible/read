Jud. 6:4. &sect; 8). The mistake probably arose from a copyist mistaking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> (ten) for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> (seven). According to Josephus, it was on the same day of the same month that the final destruction of the temple by the soldiers of Titus was accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">Which is the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon.</span> Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne in <span class="date">B.C. 605</span>, which was the fourth year of Jehoiakim, who began to reign in <span class="date">B.C. 608</span>.

He was probably led to destroy the city by the length of the resistance, and the natural strength of the position. The name, Nebuzar-adan, is probably a Hebraized form of the Babylonian Nebu-sar-iddina. "Nebo has given (us) a king." <span class="cmt_word">Captain of the guard</span>; literally <span class="accented">chief of the executioners</span>; but as the King's guard were employed to execute his commissions, and especially his death-sentences, the paraphrase is quite allowable. <span class="cmt_word">A servant of the King of Babylon</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a subject - <span class="cmt_word">unto Jerusalem.</span> He came doubtless with <span class="accented">instructions</span>, which he proceeded to carry out. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-21 The city and temple were burnt, and, it is probable, the ark in it. By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.</body></html>
