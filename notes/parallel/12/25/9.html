Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 5), four hundred and seventy years six months and ten days. This calculation, however, seems to exceed the truth. Neither the Assyrians nor the Babylonians had any regard for the gods of other nations. They everywhere burnt the temples, plundered the shrines, and carried off the images as trophies of victory. In the temple of Jerusalem they would find no images except those of the two cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-28</a>), which they probably took away with them. <span class="cmt_word">And the king's house</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1, 8-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-16.htm">2 Kings 11:16</a>). The royal palace was, perhaps, almost as magnificent as the temple; and its destruction was almost as great a loss to art. It doubtless contained Solomon's throne of ivory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>), to which there was an ascent by six steps, with two sculptured lions on each step. <span class="cmt_word">And all the houses of Jerusalem.</span> This statement is qualified by the words of the following clause, which show that only the houses of the princes and great men were purposely set on fire. Many of the remaining habitations may have perished in the conflagration, but some probably escaped, and were inhabited by "the poor of the land." <span class="cmt_word">And every great man's house burnt he with fire</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-19.htm">2 Chronicles 36:19</a>, where the Chaldeans are said to have burnt "all the palaces"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-21 The city and temple were burnt, and, it is probable, the ark in it. By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.</body></html>
