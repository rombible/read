He came to the throne 562 B.C. , upon the death of Nebuchadnezzar, who had reigned forty-three years. According to the canon of Ptolemy, Evil-merodach reigned two years.

He therefore mentions, as his last incident, the fate of Jehoiachin, who, after thirty-six years of a cruel and seemingly hopeless imprisonment, experienced a happy change of circumstances. The king who succeeded Nebuchadnezzar, his son, Evil-Merodach, in the first year of his sovereignty had compassion upon the miserable captive, and releasing him from prison, changed his garments (ver. 29), and gave him a place at his table, among other dethroned monarchs, even exalting him above the rest (ver. 28), and making him an allowance for his support (ver. 30). This alleviation of their king's condition could not but be felt by the captive Jews as a happy omen - a portent of the time when their lot too would be alleviated, and the Almighty Disposer of events, having punished them sufficiently for their sins, would relent at last, and put an end to their banishment, and give them rest and peace in their native country. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin King of Judah.</span> According to Berosus and the Canon of Ptolemy, Nebuchadnezzar reigned forty-four years. He carried off Jehoiachin to Babylon in his eighth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>), and thus the year of his death would exactly coincide with the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of the Jewish prince. <span class="cmt_word">In the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month.</span> The <span class="accented">five</span> and twentieth day, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>, (On the rarity of such exact dates in the historical Scriptures, see the comment on ver. 1.) <span class="cmt_word">That Evil-Merodach King of Babylon.</span> The native name, which is thus expressed, seems to have been "Avil-Marduk." The meaning of <span class="accented">avil</span> is uncertain; but the name probably placed the prince under the protection of Merodach, who was Nebuchadnezzar's favorite god. Avil-Marduk ascended the Babylonian throne in <span class="date">B.C. 561</span>, and reigned two years only, when he was murdered by Neriglissar, or Nergal-sar-uzur, his brother-in-law. <span class="cmt_word">In the year that he began to reign</span> - the year <span class="date">B.C. 561</span> - <span class="cmt_word">did lift up the head of Jehoiachin King of Judah out of prison.</span> (For the phrase used, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13, 19, 20</a>.) The act was probably part of a larger measure of pardon and amnesty, intended to inaugurate favorably the new reign. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:22-30 The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore. Sin alone can hurt us; Jesus alone can do good to sinners.</body></html>
