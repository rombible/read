Our translators have supplied the missing words. <span class="cmt_word">The famine prevailed in the city</span> (see the comment on ver. 2). As I have elsewhere observed, "The intensity of the suffering endured may be gathered from Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Josephus. The complexions of the men grew black with famine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-10.htm">Lamentations 5:10</a>); their skin was shrunk and parched (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>); the rich and noble women searched the dunghills for setups of offal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>); the children perished for want, or were even devoured by their parents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3, 4, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>); water was scarce, as well as food, and was sold at a price (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-4.htm">Lamentations 5:4</a>); third part of the inhabitants died of the famine, and the plague which grew out of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>)" (see the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. it. p. 147). <span class="cmt_word">And there was no bread for the people of the land.</span> Bread commonly fails comparatively early in a siege. It was some time before the fall of the city that Ebed-Meleeh expressed his fear that Jeremiah would starve, since there was no more bread in the place (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-9.htm">Jeremiah 38:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.</body></html>
