A breach was made in the wall with battering-rams, such as are depicted in the Assyrian sculptures. The Chaldaeans forced their entry on the north side of the city, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> they took the Lower City (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>). This is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>, where it is said that, after effecting an entrance, their generals proceeded to assault "the middle gate," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the gate in the north wall of Zion, which separated the upper from the lower city. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2Kings 14:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">All the men of war fled.</span>--The Hebrew here is defective, for it wants a verb, and mention of the king is implied by what follows.

A comparison of these parallels suggests the reading: "And Zedekiah king of Judah and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night," &c.<p><span class= "bld">By the way of the gate between</span> (<span class= "ital">the</span>) <span class= "bld">two walls which is </span>(was)<span class= "bld"> by the king's</span> garden.--This gate lay at the south end of the Tyrop?on, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the glen between Ophel and Zion; and is the same as "the Gate of the Fountain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm" title="But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and to the stairs that go down from the city of David.">Nehemiah 3:15</a>). The two walls were necessary for the protection of the Pool of Siloam and the water supply; besides which the point was naturally weak for purposes of defence. Whether "the king's garden" was within or without the double wall is not clear, probably the latter, as Thenius supposes.<p><span class= "bld">Now the Chaldees . . . round about.</span>--An indication that even by this route the king and his warriors had to break through the enemy's lines, as the city was completely invested.

Probably the breach was on the north side of the city, where the ground is nearly level (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>). According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 2), the enemy entered through the breach about midnight. <span class="cmt_word">And all the men of war</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all the soldiers who formed the garrison - <span class="cmt_word">fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls</span>; rather, <span class="accented">between the two walls</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>. As the enemy broke in on the north, the king and garrison quitted the city on the south by a gate which opened into the Tyropoeon valley, between the two walls that guarded the town on either side of it. <span class="cmt_word">Which is by the king's garden.</span> The royal gardens were situated near the Pool of Siloam, at the mouth of the Tyrepoeon, and near the junction of the Hinnom with the Kidron valley (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 7:11). (<span class="cmt_word">Now the Chaldees were against the city round about.</span>) The town, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">was</span> guarded on all sides by Chaldean troops, so that Zedekiah and his soldiers must either have attacked the line of guard, and broken through it, or have slipped between two of the blockading pests under cover of the darkness. As no collision is mentioned, either here or in Jeremiah, the latter seems the more probable supposition. <span class="cmt_word">And the king went the way toward the plain</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and he</span> '<span class="accented">went</span>. The writer supposes that his readers will understand that the king left the city with his troops; and so regards "he went" as sufficiently intelligible. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a> has "they went. By "the plain" (literally, "the Arabsh") the valley of the Jordan is intended, and by "the way" to it the ordinary road from Jerusalem to Jericho. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.</body></html>
