In the whole range of the history contained in the two Books of the Kings, there is no instance of the year, month, and day being all given excepting in the present chapter, where we find this extreme exactness three times (vers. 1, 4, and 8). The date in ver. 1 is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem</span>. 'According to the description of the eye-witness, Jeremiah, the army was one of unusual magnitude. Nebuchadnezzar brought against Jerusalem at this time "all <span class="accented">his army</span>, <span class="accented">and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion</span>, and <span class="accented">all the people"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>). The march of the army was not direct upon Jerusalem; it at first spread itself over Judea, wasting the country and capturing the smaller fortified towns (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect;3) - among them Lachish, so famous in the war against Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>), and Azekah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>). The capture of these two places was important as intercepting Zedekiah's line of communication with Egypt. Having made himself master of them, Nebuchadnezzar proceeded to invest the capital. <span class="cmt_word">And pitched against it</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, encamped, and commenced a regular siege - <span class="cmt_word">and they built forts against it round about.</span> It has been argued that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> does not mean a "fort" or "tower," but a "line of circumvallation" (Michaelis, Hitzig, Thenius, Bahr). Jerusalem, however, can scarcely be surrounded by lines of circumvallation, which, moreover, were not employed in their sieges by the Orientals. <span class="accented">Dayek</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span>) seems to be properly a "watchtower," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, <span class="accented">speculari</span>, whence it passed into the meaning of a "tower" generally. The towers used in sieges by the Assyrians and Babylonians were movable ones, made of planks, which were pushed up to the walls, so that the assailants might attack their adversaries, on a level, with greater advantage. Sometimes they contained battering rams (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, pl. 19; and setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a>; Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.</body></html>
