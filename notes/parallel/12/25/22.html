After hesitating whether to accompany Nebuzaradan to Babylon or not, the prophet finally decided upon repairing to Gedaliah at Mizpah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.">Jeremiah 40:1-6</a>). Gedaliah's magnanimous behaviour in regard to Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-16.htm" title="But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing: for you speak falsely of Ishmael.">Jeremiah 40:16</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) shows that he was not a traitor and deserter as some have misnamed him. Rather he was a disciple of Jeremiah, and did his utmost to induce the remnant over which he was appointed governor to submit with patience to their divinely-ordered lot, as the prophet urged them to do.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-26.</span> <span class="accented">- History of the remnant left in the land by Nebuzar-adan</span>. Nebuchadnezzar, when he carried off Zedekiah to Babylon, appointed, as governor of Judaea, a certain Gedaliah, a Jew of good position, but not of the royal family. Gedaliah made Mizpah, near Jerusalem, his residence; and here he was shortly joined by a number of Jews of importance, who had escaped from Jerusalem and hidden themselves until the Babylonians were gone. Of these the most eminent were Johanan the son of Karcah, and Ishmael, a member of the royal house of David. Gedaliah urged the refugees to be good subjects of the King of Babylon, and to settle themselves to agricultural pursuits. His advice was accepted and at first followed; but presently a warning was given to Gedaliah by Johanan that Ishmael designed his destruction; and soon afterwards, as Gedaliah took no precautions, the murder was actually carried out. Other atrocities followed; but after a time Johanan and the other leading refugees took up arms, forced Ishmael to fly to the Ammonites, and then, fearing that Nebuchadnezzar would hold them responsible for Ishmael's act, against Jeremiah's remonstrances, fled, with the great mass of the Jews that had been left in the land, from Judaea into Egypt. Here our writer leaves them (ver. 26), without touching on the calamities which befell them there, according to the prophetic announcements of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2-28</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah.</span> These con-stated of Gedaliah and his court, which included Jeremiah, Baruch, and some princesses of the royal house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>); the poor of the land, whom Nebuzar-adan had intentionally left behind; and a considerable number of Jewish refugees of a better class, who came in from the neighboring nations, and from places in Judaea where they had been hiding themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7-12</a>). For about two months all went well with this "remnant," who applied themselves to agricultural pursuits, in which they prospered greatly. <span class="cmt_word">Whom Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon had left</span> (see ver. 12), <span class="cmt_word">even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</span> Ahikam had protected Jeremiah in his earlier days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>); Gedaliah protected him in the latter part of the siege (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>). Nebuchadnezzar's choice of Gedaliah for governor was probably made from some knowledge of his having sided with Jeremiah, whose persistent endeavors to make the Jews submit to the Babylonian yoke seem to have been well known, not only to the Jews, but to the Babylonians; most likely by reason of the letter he sent to his countrymen already in captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Shaphan, ruler.</span> Probably not "Shaphan the scribe" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3, 12</a>), but an unknown person of the same name. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:22-30 The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore. Sin alone can hurt us; Jesus alone can do good to sinners.</body></html>
