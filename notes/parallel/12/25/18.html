He had stayed at his post till the city was taken, and was now seized by Nebuzar-adan as one of the most important personages whom he found in the city. <span class="cmt_word">And Zephaniah the second priest.</span> Keil and Bahr translate "<span class="accented">a</span> priest of the second order;' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a mere Ordinary priest; but something more than this must be intended by Jeremiah, who calls him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-34.htm">Jeremiah 52:34</a>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> distinctly "<span class="accented">the</span> second priest." It is conjectured that he was the high priest's substitute, empowered to act for him on occasions. Possibly he was the Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah, of whom we hear a good deal in Jeremiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25-29</a>: 37:3). <span class="cmt_word">And the three keepers of the door</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and three keepers of the threshold</span>. There were twenty-five "gatekeepers" of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-17.htm">1 Chronicles 26:17, 18</a>), all of them Levites. On what principle Nebuzar-adan selected three out of the twenty-four is uncertain, since we have no evidence that the temple had. as Bahr says it had, "three main entrances." <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a> certainly does not prove this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-21 The city and temple were burnt, and, it is probable, the ark in it. By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.</body></html>
