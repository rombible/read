It is no argument against the singular, "he carried him to Babylon," to say with Thenius that Zedekiah was sent to Babylon at once, while Nebuchadnezzar remained at Riblah. <span class= "ital">"</span>Qui facit per alium, facit per se."<p><span class= "bld">The sons.</span>--Who fled with him (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm" title="Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.">Jeremiah 41:10</a>). In Jeremiah it is added that all the nobles or princes. of Judah were slain also.<p><span class= "bld">Put out the eyes.</span>--A Babylonian punishment (Herod, vii. 18). This was the meaning of Ezekiel's prediction; "I will bring him to Babylon . . . <span class= "ital">yet shall he not see it,</span> though he shall die there" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm" title="My net also will I spread on him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.">Ezekiel 12:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">With fetters of brass.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">with the double brass</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-12.htm" title="And when he was in affliction, he sought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,">2Chronicles 33:12</a>); <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> with manacles and fetters, as represented on the Assyrian monuments.<p><span class= "bld">Carried him to Babylon.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm" title="Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.">Jeremiah 52:11</a>; "and put him in prison till the day of his death." So the Arabic of Kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes</span> (comp. Herod., 3:14, and 2 Macc. 7, for similar aggravations of condemned persons' sufferings). As Zedekiah was no more than thirty-two years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), his sons must have been minors, who could not justly be held responsible for their father's doings. It was usual, however, in the East, and even among the Jews, to punish children for the sins of their fathers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And put out the eyes of Zedekiah.</span> This, too, was a common Oriental practice. The Philistines blinded Samson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). Sargon, in one of his sculptures, seems to be blinding a prisoner with a spear (Botta, 'Monumens de Ninive,' pl. 18). The ancient Persians often blinded criminals (Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:9. &sect; 13; Ammian. Mare., 27:12; Procop., 'De Bell. Pers.,' 1:11. p. 80). In modern Persia, it was, until very lately, usual for a king, on his accession, to blind all his brothers, in order that they might be disqualified from reigning. The operation was commonly performed in Persia by means of a red-hot iron rod (see Herod., 7:18). Zedekiah's loss of eyesight reconciled the two apparently conflicting prophecies - that he would be carried captive to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>, etc.), and that he would never see it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>) - in a remarkable manner. <span class="cmt_word">And bound him with fetters of brass</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with a pair of brazen fetters</span>. Assyrian fetters consisted of two thick rings of iron, joined together by a single long link (Botta, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>); Babylonian were probably similar. Captives of importance are usually represented as fettered in the sculptures. <span class="cmt_word">And carried him to Babylon.</span> Jeremiah adds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar "put him in prison till the day of his death:" and so Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 7). The latter writer further tells us that, at his death, the Babylonian monarch gave him a royal funeral (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.</body></html>
