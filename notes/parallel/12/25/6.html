Nebuchadnezzar with the grandees of his court, perhaps including some dependent princes of the country, held a solemn trial of Zedekiah, as a rebel against his liege lord, in which, no doubt, his breach of oath was made prominent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm" title="And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.">2Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm" title="But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people.

The Egyptian and Persian artists also represent it. To Riblah. (For the situation of Riblah, see the comment on 2 Kings 23:33.) As Nebuchadnezzar was engaged at one and the same time in directing the sieges both of Tyro and of Jerusalem, it was a most convenient position for him to occupy. <span class="cmt_word">And they gave judgment upon him.</span> As a rebel, who had broken his covenant and his oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16, 18</a>), Zedekiah was brought to trial before Nebuchadnezzar and his great lords. The facts could not be denied, and sentence was therefore passed upon him, nominally by the court, practically by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). By an unusual act of clemency, his life was spared; but the judgment was still sufficiently severe (see the next verse). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.</body></html>
