As David's harping refreshed Saul, and tranquillized his spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>), so the playing of any skilled minstrel had a soothing effect on those possessing the prophetic gift generally, and enabled them to shut out the outer world, and concentrate their whole attention on the inward voice which communicated to them the Divine messages. <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.</span> By "the hand of the Lord" is meant the power of the Spirit of God, the Divine effluence, whatever it was, which acquainted the prophets with the Divine will, and enabled them to utter it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-19 The king of Israel laments their distress, and the danger they were in.

It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.</body></html>
