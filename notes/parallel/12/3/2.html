(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/10-26.htm" title="And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.">2Kings 10:26-27</a>, and Notes.)<p><span class= "bld">The image.</span>--<span class= "ital">Pillar.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-4.htm" title="And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.">2Chronicles 34:4</a>.) The LXX., Vulg., and Arabic read "pillars" (a different pointing); and the LXX. adds at the end, "and brake them in pieces." This seems original. Ahab would be likely to set up more than one pillar to Baal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord</span> - as did every other king of Israel both before him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-16.htm">1 Kings 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-13.htm">1 Kings 16:13, 19, 25, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>) and after him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-27.htm">2 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-31.htm">2 Kings 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-2.htm">2 Kings 13:2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-24.htm">2 Kings 14:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-9.htm">2 Kings 15:9, 18, 24, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-2.htm">2 Kings 17:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">but not like his father, and like his mother</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Ahab and Jezebel, the introducers of the Baal-worship into Israel - <span class="cmt_word">for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</span> It had not been said previously that Ahab had actually set up an image of Baal, but only that he had "built him a house in Samaria, and reared him up an altar," and that he "served him and worshipped him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31, 32</a>). But an image of the god for whom a "house" was built was so much a matter of course in the idolatrous systems of the East, that it might have seemed superfluous to mention it. The actual existence of the image appears later, when its destruction is recorded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>). It seems that Jehoram, at the commencement of his reign, took warning by the fates of his father and brother, so far as to abolish the state worship of Baal, which his father had introduced, and to remove the image of Baal from the temple where it had been set up. The image, however, was not destroyed - it was only "put away." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Jehoram took warning by God's judgment, and put away the image of Baal, yet he maintained the worship of the calves. Those do not truly repent or reform, who only part with the sins they lose by, but continue to love the sins that they think to gain by.</body></html>
