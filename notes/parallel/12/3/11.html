Jehoshaphat is for "seeking Jehovah" through a prophet, in contrast with Jehoram, who at once despairs. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek you me, and you shall live:">Amos 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm" title="Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:">Amos 5:8</a>; and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-3.htm" title="And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.">1Chronicles 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-2.htm" title="And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while you be with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.">2Chronicles 15:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">One of the king of Israel's servants.</span>--One of the king's staff, who, like Obadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-3.htm" title="And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.

The phrase alludes to the well-known Oriental custom of the servant pouring water from a ewer on his master's hands to wash them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?</span> The Israelite monarch despairs at once; the Jewish monarch retains faith and hope. Undoubtedly he ought to have had inquiry made of the Lord <span class="accented">before</span> he consented to accompany Jehoram on the expedition. But one neglect of duty does not justify persistence in neglect. This he sees, and therefore suggests that even now, at the eleventh hour, the right course shall be taken. It may not even yet be too late. <span class="cmt_word">And one of the King of Israel's servants</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, one of the officers in attendance on him - <span class="cmt_word">answered and said, Here is Elisha.</span> Apparently,-Jehoram was not aware of Elisha's presence with the army. He had to be enlightened by one of his attendants, who happened to be acquainted with the fact. We may suppose that Elisha had joined the army "at the instigation of the Spirit of God" (Keil), God having resolved to rescue the Israelites from their peril by his instrumentality, and at the same time to show forth his glory before the people of Moab. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Shaphat</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16, 19</a>), <span class="cmt_word">which poured water on the hands of Elijah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who was accustomed to minister to Elijah's wants, and to attend upon him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-19 The king of Israel laments their distress, and the danger they were in. He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.</body></html>
