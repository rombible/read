(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/8-12.htm" title="And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.">2Kings 8:12-13</a>.) Taken as <span class= "ital">commands</span>, they appear to conflict with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-19.htm" title="When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an ax against them: for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:">Deuteronomy 20:19</a>, where the felling of an enemy's <span class= "ital">fruit trees</span> for the purposes of siege-works is forbidden.

But a careful examination of the passage in Deuteronomy will show <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that there is no general prohibition of the cutting down of fruit trees, but only a prohibition of their being cut down for <span class="accented">siege works</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the prohibition rests on prudential, not on moral, grounds, and is thus practically limited to cases where the conquest of the country attacked, and its occupation by the conquerors, are looked forward to. The words are, "When thou shalt besiege a city.... thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: <span class="accented">for thou mayest eat of them</span>." The destruction of the fruit trees in an enemy's country was a common feature of the wars of the period, and was largely practiced, both By the Assyrians and the Egyptians (see Layard's 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, p. 73; second series, pl. 40; 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 588; and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 5, 51, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And stop all wells of water.</span> The stoppage of springs and wells was another common practice in ancient times, often employed against enemies and aliens. The Philistines stopped the Hebrew wells in the days of Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>). Hezekiah stopped the springs of water outside Jerusalem, when he expected to be besieged By the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3, 4</a>). The Scythians, when Darius invaded their country, stopped all their own wells as they retired before him (Herod., 4:120). Arsaces III. partly stopped, and partly poi-ached, the Persian wells in his war with Antiochus the Great (Polyb., 10:28. &sect; 5). The practice was regarded as quite legitimate. <span class="cmt_word">And mar every good piece of land with stones</span>; literally, <span class="accented">grieve every good piece of land</span>. To clear the stones off a piece of ground was the first step towards preparing it for cultivation in the stony regions on either side of the Jordan. The clearance was generally effected by collecting the stones into heaps. When it was wished to "mar the land," the stones were there to be spread over it afresh. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-19 The king of Israel laments their distress, and the danger they were in. He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.</body></html>
