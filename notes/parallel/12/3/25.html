He (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the commander, or the army) went on destroying and leveling the cities, <span class="accented">until</span> he came to Kir-haraseth, which proved too strong for him. There he was obliged to leave the stones untouched. Kir-haraseth, which is not mentioned among the early Moabite towns, nor even upon the Moabite Stone, and which is therefore thought to have been a newly constructed fortress (Ewald), was, in the later times, one of the most important of the strongholds of Moab (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>). It was sometimes called Kir-Moab, "the fortress of Moab." At what time it got the name of Kerak is uncertain; but we find it spoken of as Kerak-Moab by Ptolemy (about A.D. ), and by Stephen of Byzantium (about A.D. ). It was a place of much importance in the time of the Crusades. The situation is one of great strength. The fortress is built upon the top of a steep hill, surrounded on all sides by a deep arid narrow valley, which again is completely enclosed by mountains, rising higher than the fort itself. It is undoubtedly one of the strongest positions within the territory anciently possessed by the Moabites. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</span> Ewald thinks that by "<span class="accented">slingers"</span> are meant, not mere ordinary slingers, but persons who worked more elaborate engines, as catapults and the like ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 89, note, Eng. trans.). He is undoubtedly correct in saying that "all sorts of elaborate modes of attacking fortifications were very early known in Asia;" but it is very questionable whether the Hebrew word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) can mean anything but "slingers" in the usual sense. The LXX. translate by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The situation is one which would allow of "slingers," in the ordinary sense, sending their missiles into the place, and grievously harassing it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:20-27 It is a blessing to be favoured with the company of those who have power with God, and can prevail by their prayers. A kingdom may be upheld and prosper, in consequence of the fervent prayers of those who are dear to God. May we place our highest regard upon such as are most precious in his account. When sinners are saying Peace, peace, destruction comes upon them: despair will follow their mad presumption. In Satan's service and at his suggestion, such horrid deeds have been done, as cause the natural feelings of the heart to shudder; like the king of Moab's sacrificing his son. It is well not to urge the worst of men to extremities; we should rather leave them to the judgment of God.</body></html>
