A more exact definition of the time. The reckoning by <span class= "ital">hours</span> was unknown before the captivity. According to the Talmud, the morning sacrifice was offered in the Temple the moment it became light. (Ewald assumes that "the meat offering" was offered on this occasion in the camp.) That help came to the distressed army just at the hour of morning worship was a striking coincidence. (This allusion to the law of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.">Exodus 29:38</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>., may be an <span class= "ital">indirect</span> hit at the northern kingdom.)<p><span class= "bld">There came water.</span>--<span class= "ital">Water was coming from the way</span> (direction) <span class= "ital">of Edom</span>. It would seem that a sudden storm of rain had fallen on the mountains of Seir, at some distance from the camp (Josephus says at a distance of three days' march); and the water found its natural outlet in the dry wady. Reuss thinks this explanation "superfluous," in the face of "the author's intention to describe a <span class= "ital">miracle</span>;" but there are different kinds of miracle, and, in the present instance, the miraculous element is visible in the prophet's prediction of the coming help, and in the <span class= "ital">coincidence</span> of the natural phenomena with the needs of the Israelites. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/7-1.htm" title="Then Elisha said, Hear you the word of the LORD; Thus said the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.">2Kings 7:1-2</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>.) [This statement seems to preclude also the naturalistic explanation founded on the meaning of the Arabic name of the locality. <span class= "ital">Hisyun, hasyun, hasan</span>, mean water which gathers on a hard bottom under the sand in certain localities, and which the Arabs get at by scooping holes in the ground. See Lane, <span class= "ital">Arab. Eng.

The nocturnal storm had burst, not in the Moabite country, where it would have attracted the attention of the Moabites, but in some comparatively distant part of the Idumaean territory, so that the Moabites were not aware of it. Josephus says that the storm burst at a distance of three days' journey from the Israelite camp ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:3. &sect; 2); but this can only be his conjecture. <span class="cmt_word">And the country was filled, with water.</span> By "the country" (<span class="accented">ha-arets</span>) must be meant here the bed or channel of the water-course. This was suddenly filled with a rushing stream, which, however, rapidly ran off, leaving the water-course dry, excepting where the pits had been made by the Israelites. But this supply was ample for the army. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:20-27 It is a blessing to be favoured with the company of those who have power with God, and can prevail by their prayers. A kingdom may be upheld and prosper, in consequence of the fervent prayers of those who are dear to God. May we place our highest regard upon such as are most precious in his account. When sinners are saying Peace, peace, destruction comes upon them: despair will follow their mad presumption. In Satan's service and at his suggestion, such horrid deeds have been done, as cause the natural feelings of the heart to shudder; like the king of Moab's sacrificing his son. It is well not to urge the worst of men to extremities; we should rather leave them to the judgment of God.</body></html>
