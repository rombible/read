Jehoshaphat is accepted because of his faithful dependence on Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2Kings 3:11</a>). Jehoram still maintained or tolerated the cultus of Bethel and Dan.

Even now he was engaged in an expedition which had received no Divine sanction, and was allied with two idolatrous monarchs. But Elisha condones these derelictions of duty in consideration of the king's honesty of purpose and steady attachment to Jehovah, which is witnessed to by the authors both of Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>) and Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-5.htm">2 Chronicles 20:5-21</a>, etc.). He "regards the presence of Jehoshaphat," and therefore consents to return an answer to the three kings, and announce to them the mode of their deliverance. The adjuration wherewith he opens his speech is one of great solemnity, only used upon very special occasions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>), and adds great force to his declaration. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-19 The king of Israel laments their distress, and the danger they were in. He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.</body></html>
