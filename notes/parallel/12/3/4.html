In Arabic, <span class= "ital">naqad</span> means a kind of sheep of superior wool; <span class= "ital">naqqad</span>, the owner or shepherd of such sheep. The land of Moab is mountainous, but well watered, and rich in fertile valleys, and thus specially suited for pasture; and the Arabian wilderness lay open to the Moabite shepherds and their flocks.<p><span class= "bld">Rendered.</span>--<span class= "ital">Used to render</span> (<span class= "ital">waw</span> conversive of the perfect); scil., year by year. This tribute is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm" title="Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.">Isaiah 16:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">With the wool.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in wool</span> (an accusative of <span class= "ital">limitation</span>). The word rendered "lambs" (<span class= "ital">k?rim</span>) means lambs fatted for food. The expression "in wool," therefore, relates only to the <span class= "ital">rams</span>. Mesha's annual tribute was paid in kind, and consisted of a hundred thousand fatted lambs and the fleeces of a hundred thousand rams. This was a heavy burden for a country no larger than the county of Huntingdon. (Comp.

The LXX. adds, <span class= "greekheb">?? ?? ???????????</span> ("in the revolt"); implying that the present rebellion was distinct from that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm" title="Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.">2Kings 1:1</a>, and that this tribute was imposed as an indemnity for the former revolt.

The historian goes back to the origin of the war. He had already, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>, mentioned the revolt of Moab at the death of Ahab; but he now recalls his readers' attention to the fact, and to some extent explains it and accounts for it. Moab had been treated oppressively - had been forced to pay an extraordinarily heavy tribute - and was in a certain sense driven into rebellion (vers. 4, 5). Jehoram, when he came to the kingdom, determined to make a great effort to put the rebellion down, and to re-establish the authority of Israel over the revolted people His relations with Jehoshaphat of Israel were so close that he had no difficulty in persuading him to join in the war. He was also able to obtain the alliance of the King of Edom. Thus strengthened, he made no doubt of being successful, and confidently invaded the country (vers. 6-9). The course of the war is then related (vers. 10-27). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Jehoram took warning by God's judgment, and put away the image of Baal, yet he maintained the worship of the calves. Those do not truly repent or reform, who only part with the sins they lose by, but continue to love the sins that they think to gain by.</body></html>
