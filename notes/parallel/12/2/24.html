He then contrasts the behaviour of the "historical" David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm" title="And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why have you done so?">2Samuel 16:10</a>). But (1) the curse of a prophet was an inspired <span class= "ital">prediction</span> of punitive disaster; (2) Beth-el was a chief seat of idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-29.htm" title="And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.">1Kings 12:29</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm" title="Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:">Amos 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm" title="But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.">Amos 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm" title="Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the middle of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.">Amos 7:10</a>), and the mobbing of the new prophetic leader may have been premeditated; (3) at all events, the narrative is too brief to enable us to judge of the merits of the case; and (4) what is related belongs to that dispensation in which judgment was made more prominent than mercy, and directly fulfils the menace of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-21.htm" title="And if you walk contrary to me, and will not listen to me; I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.">Leviticus 26:21</a>, seq.<p><span class= "bld">Two she bears.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-8.htm" title="I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the lobe of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.">Hosea 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-12.htm" title="Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.">Proverbs 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm" title="As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.">Amos 5:19</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-25.htm" title="And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.">2Kings 17:25</a>.) Wild beasts were common in Palestine in those days.<p><span class= "bld">Forty and two.</span>--This may be a definite for an indefinite number. It shows that the mob of young persons who beset the prophet was considerable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he turned back, and looked on them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and he looked behind him</span>, <span class="accented">and saw them</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the Revised Version. The boys, after the manner of boys, were following him, hanging upon him, not daring to draw too near, hooting him from behind, as ill-bred and ill-intentioned youths are apt to do. <span class="cmt_word">And cursed them in the name of the Lord.</span> The action cannot be defended from a Christian point of view - Christians have no right to curse any one. But we can well understand that, under the old covenant, a prophet newly installed in office, and commencing his ministry, might deem it right to vindicate the honor of his office by visiting such conduct as that of these misguided youths with a malediction. Under the Law God's ministers were required to curse the disobedient (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14-26</a>). Elisha could not tell what would be the effect of his curse. It could have no effect at all excepting through the will and by the action of God. <span class="cmt_word">And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood</span>; or, <span class="accented">the forest</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the forest, which, as all knew, lay within a short distance of Bethel, and was the haunt of wild beasts (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-24.htm">1 Kings 3:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And tare forty and two children of them.</span> It is not said how far the lads were injured, whether fatally or not. But the punishment, whatever its severity, came from God, not from the prophet, and we may be sure was just. For "shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" A severe example may have been needed under the circumstances of the time, when a new generation was growing up in contempt of God and of religion; and the sin of the lads was not a small one, but indicated that determined bent of the will against good, and preference of evil, which is often developed early, and generally goes on from bad to worse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-25 Observe the miracle of healing the waters. Prophets should make every place to which they come better for them, endeavouring to sweeten bitter spirits, and to make barren souls fruitful, by the word of God, which is like the salt cast into the water by Elisha. It was an apt emblem of the effect produced by the grace of God on the sinful heart of man. Whole families, towns, and cities, sometimes have a new appearance through the preaching of the gospel; wickedness and evil have been changed into fruitfulness in the works of righteousness, which are, through Christ, to the praise and glory of God. Here is a curse on the youths of Bethel, enough to destroy them; it was not a curse causeless, for it was Elisha's character, as God's prophet, that they abused. They bade him go up, reflecting on the taking up of Elijah into heaven. The prophet acted by Divine impulse. If the Holy Spirit had not directed Elisha's solemn curse, the providence of God would not have followed it with judgment. The Lord must be glorified as a righteous God who hates sin, and will reckon for it. Let young persons be afraid of speaking wicked words, for God notices what they say. Let them not mock at any for defects in mind or body; especially it is at their peril, if they scoff at any for well doing. Let parents that would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their hearts. And what will be the anguish of those parents, at the day of judgment, who witness the everlasting condemnation of their offspring, occasioned by their own bad example, carelessness, or wicked teaching!</body></html>
