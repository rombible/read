(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-26.htm" title="There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in your land: the number of your days I will fulfill.">Exodus 23:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-11.htm" title="And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:11</a>.) The use of different waters is said to have good and bad effects upon the functions of conception and parturition (not "a popular superstition," as Reuss suggests). "The ground is barren," or unfruitful, is therefore an incorrect translation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-25.</span> - The historian passes to the record of some of Elisha's minor miracles, belonging to the time whereof he is writing, and helping to explain the position of dignity and respect which he is found to occupy in the next chapter (vers. 11-14). The miracles showed his twofold power, both to confer benefits and to punish. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the men of the city</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the inhabitants of Jericho; probably the civic authorities, having heard of the recent miracle - <span class="cmt_word">said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth.</span> According to the unanimous voice of travelers, the situation of Jericho (now <span class="accented">Eriha</span>) is charming. Lying on a broad plain which is traversed by an abundant river, at the point where one of the main wadys debouched from the Judaean upland upon the low country, shaded by groves of palm trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>) and fig-mulberries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-4.htm">Luke 19:4</a>), the air scented with aromatic shrubs, opobalsam, myroba-lanum, and the like, facing the Orient sun, and commanding a wide prospect both across and also up and down the Ghor, with the mountains of Moab in the distance, Jericho was, no doubt, even before the miracle of Elisha, a "pleasant" place. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - there was one drawback - <span class="cmt_word">the water is naught, and the ground barren.</span> Bitter and brackish springs, of which there are many in the Jordan valley, gushed forth from the foot of the mountains, and formed rivulets, which ran across the plain towards the Jordan, not diffusing health and fertility, but rather disease and barrenness. Untimely births, abortions, and the like prevailed among the cattle which were fed in the neighborhood, perhaps even among the inhabitants of the locality, and were attributed to the bitter springs, which made the land "miscarrying" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.). It was the prayer of the men of Jericho that Elisha would remove this inconvenience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-25 Observe the miracle of healing the waters. Prophets should make every place to which they come better for them, endeavouring to sweeten bitter spirits, and to make barren souls fruitful, by the word of God, which is like the salt cast into the water by Elisha. It was an apt emblem of the effect produced by the grace of God on the sinful heart of man. Whole families, towns, and cities, sometimes have a new appearance through the preaching of the gospel; wickedness and evil have been changed into fruitfulness in the works of righteousness, which are, through Christ, to the praise and glory of God. Here is a curse on the youths of Bethel, enough to destroy them; it was not a curse causeless, for it was Elisha's character, as God's prophet, that they abused. They bade him go up, reflecting on the taking up of Elijah into heaven. The prophet acted by Divine impulse. If the Holy Spirit had not directed Elisha's solemn curse, the providence of God would not have followed it with judgment. The Lord must be glorified as a righteous God who hates sin, and will reckon for it. Let young persons be afraid of speaking wicked words, for God notices what they say. Let them not mock at any for defects in mind or body; especially it is at their peril, if they scoff at any for well doing. Let parents that would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their hearts. And what will be the anguish of those parents, at the day of judgment, who witness the everlasting condemnation of their offspring, occasioned by their own bad example, carelessness, or wicked teaching!</body></html>
