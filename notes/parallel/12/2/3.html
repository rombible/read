There was a guild of prophets at Beth-el.<p><span class= "bld">Came forth to Elisha.</span>--Who probably walked a little way before his master, to announce his approach.<p><span class= "bld">And said unto him.</span>--The prophetic college had been divinely forewarned of Elijah's departure.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord will take away . . . to day.</span>--"To day" is emphatic. "Knowest thou that this day Jehovah is about to take away thy lord from beside thee?" The word "head" may signify <span class= "ital">self</span>, or <span class= "ital">person</span>, like the word "soul," and other terms. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm" title="Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head, and restore you to your place: and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his butler.">Genesis 40:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-2.htm" title="And David said to Achish, Surely you shall know what your servant can do.

Others explain "from over thy head," i.e., from his position of superiority over thee as thy master and teacher. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-21.htm" title="And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat.

Others again, but very improbably, take the words literally as a reference to Elijah's ascension, "away over thine head."<p><span class= "bld">Yea, I know.</span>--Rather, I, too, know.<p><span class= "bld">Hold ye your peace.</span>--Elisha says this, not to prevent the gathering of a crowd to witness the spectacle of Elijah's departure, nor yet to intimate that his master's modesty will be shocked by much talk of his approaching exaltation, but simply to suggest that the subject is painful both to him and to his beloved master. The Hebrew term, <span class= "ital">heh?sh-</span>, imitates the sound, like our "hush!"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of the prophets that were at Bethel</span> (On the expression, "sons of the prophets," see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>.) The institution of the "schools of the prophets," or theological colleges where young prophets were brought up, is usually assigned to Samuel, one of whose habitual residences for a part of the year was Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). Probably he had established a "school" there which continued to this time. <span class="cmt_word">Came forth to Elisha, and said unto him</span>. The students did not venture to address the master himself, who was a person of too much dignity to be intruded on; but sought out the servant, to give him a warning of what their prophetic instinct assured them was about to happen. <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from his position as teacher and master) today? There was, perhaps, something a little officious and self-assertive in this question. They might have felt sure, if they had been properly modest, that Elisha would have at least as much prophetic instinct and foresight as themselves. Hence he answers them with something of rebuke: <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Yea, I know it</span> - literally, <span class="accented">I too know it</span> - <span class="cmt_word">hold ye your peace</span>; or, "Hush - do not chatter about what is so sacred; do not suppose that you are wiser than any one else; be a little modest and a little reticent." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 The Lord had let Elijah know that his time was at hand. He therefore went to the different schools of the prophets to give them his last exhortations and blessing. The removal of Elijah was a type and figure of the ascension of Christ, and the opening of the kingdom of heaven to all believers. Elisha had long followed Elijah, and he would not leave him now when he hoped for the parting blessing. Let not those who follow Christ come short by tiring at last. The waters of Jordan, of old, yielded to the ark; now, to the prophet's mantle, as a token of God's presence. When God will take up his faithful ones to heaven, death is the Jordan which they must pass through, and they find a way through it. The death of Christ has divided those waters, that the ransomed of the Lord may pass over. O death, where is thy sting, thy hurt, thy terror!</body></html>
