If not, let Him now show His power, and verify the granting of my request (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.">2Kings 2:9</a>). The words are a sort of irony of faith. Elisha "seeks" Jehovah as the only source of power. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm" title="Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?">Jeremiah 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm" title="The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.">Jeremiah 2:8</a>, where the priests and prophets are blamed for having recourse to idols, instead of asking, "Where is Jehovah?")<p><span class= "bld">And when he also had smitten.</span>--The Hebrew <span class= "ital">is, also</span> (or, <span class= "ital">even</span>)<span class= "ital"> he--and he smote</span>. There is clearly something wrong. The LXX. does not render the Hebrew <span class= "ital">'aph h-'</span> "also he," but copies the words in Greek (<span class= "greekheb">????</span>). Keil connects them with the foregoing question, "Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah, even He?" Thenius objects that this use of <span class= "ital">'aph</span> is doubtful, and supports Houbigant's correction, <span class= "ital">'?pho</span>, an enclitic then--"Where, then, is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and he smote," &c. Perhaps <span class= "ital">'eph?h</span> ("where") was the original reading: "Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? Where?"--an emphatic repetition of the question. Or it may be that the words <span class= "ital">'aph h-' wayyakkeh</span> should be transposed: "and he smote--he also (like Elijah)," &c. The Vulgate has the curious renderings, "And with the cloak of Elias which had fallen from him, he smote the waters, and they were not divided; and he said, Where is the God of Elias now also? And he smote the waters, and they were divided," &c. Such also is the reading of the Complutensian LXX.; but the variation is simply an old attempt to account for the twofold "and he smote the waters."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him; and smote the waters</span> - imitated, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the action of Elijah (ver. 8), as Elijah had imitated the action of Moses at the passage of the Red Sea - <span class="cmt_word">and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah?</span> The present Hebrew text reads, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah, <span class="accented">even he</span>?" the last two words being emphatic; but the emphasis scarcely appears to be needed. Hence the translators have very generally detached the two words from Elisha's question, and, attaching them to the succeeding clause, have rendered it, <span class="cmt_word">And when he also had smitten the waters</span>; but the position of the van conjunctive, after <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e3;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> and before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, makes this division of the clauses impossible. It has therefore been proposed by some to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, "now," for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e3;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>, "even he" (Houbigant, Thenius, Schultz, Botteher, Dathe), and to translate, "Where <span class="accented">now</span> is the Lord God of Elijah?" Is he still here, with me, or has he withdrawn himself from earth with his prophet, and left me alone to my own unaided strength? This gives a good meaning, but is perhaps too bold a change. The LXX. had evidently our present Hebrew text before them, and, as they could make nothing of it, transcribed it into Greek characters, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x397;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they parted hither and thither: and Elisha wont over.</span> God showed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that he was still with Elisha by enabling him to repeat Elijah's last miracle, and thus gave him an assurance that he would be with him thenceforth An his prophetic ministry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-18 Elijah left his mantle to Elisha; as a token of the descent of the Spirit upon him; it was more than if he had left him thousands of gold and silver. Elisha took it up, not as a sacred relic to be worshipped, but as a significant garment to be worn. Now that Elijah was taken to heaven, Elisha inquired, 1. After God; when our creature-comforts are removed, we have a God to go to, who lives for ever. 2. After the God that Elijah served, and honoured, and pleaded for. The Lord God of the holy prophets is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; but what will it avail us to have the mantles of those that are gone, their places, their books, if we have not their spirit, their God? See Elisha's dividing the river; God's people need not fear at last passing through the Jordan of death as on dry ground. The sons of the prophets made a needless search for Elijah. Wise men may yield to that, for the sake of peace, and the good opinion of others, which yet their judgment is against, as needless and fruitless. Traversing hills and valleys will never bring us to Elijah, but following the example of his holy faith and zeal will, in due time.</body></html>
