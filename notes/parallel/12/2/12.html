The Targum paraphrases, "My master, my master, who was better to Israel than chariots and horsemen by his prayers." The personal work and influence of a prophet like Elijah was the truest safeguard of Israel. The force of the expression will be seen, if it is remembered that chariots and horsemen constituted, in that age, the chief military arm, and were indispensable for the struggle against the Aramean states. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-2.htm" title="Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor;">2Kings 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm" title="Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.

The condition was fulfilled which Elijah had laid down, and Elisha knew that his request for a "double portion" of his master's spirit was granted. <span class="cmt_word">And he cried, My father! my father!</span> It was usual for servants thus to address their masters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13</a>), and younger men would, out of respect, almost always thus address an aged prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>, etc.). But Elisha probably meant something more than to show respect. He regarded himself as Elijah's specially adopted son, and hence had claimed the "double portion" of the firstborn. That his request was granted showed that the relationship was acknowledged. <span class="cmt_word">The chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the best earthly defense of Israel. "In losing thee," he means, "we lose our great protector - him that is more to us than chariots and horsemen - the strength of Israel, against both domestic and foreign foes." The sight of the fiery chariot and horses may have determined the imagery, but they are not spoken cf. Note the substitution of "horsemen" for "horses," and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10</a>, where the same expression is used in reference to Elisha. <span class="cmt_word">And he saw him no more.</span> Elijah passed beyond Elisha's ken. So far as we can gather from the expressions employed, no cloud received him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>), but he gradually vanished from sight. <span class="cmt_word">And he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces</span>; an <span class="accented">action</span> marking extreme horror or extreme grief - here the latter (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:9-12 That fulness, from whence prophets and apostles had all their supply, still exists as of old, and we are told to ask large supplies from it. Diligent attendance upon Elijah, particularly in his last hours, would be proper means for Elisha to obtain much of his spirit. The comforts of departing saints, and their experiences, help both to gild our comforts and to strengthen our resolutions. Elijah is carried to heaven in a fiery chariot. Many questions might be asked about this, which could not be answered. Let it suffice that we are told, what his Lord, when he came, found him doing. He was engaged in serious discourse, encouraging and directing Elisha about the kingdom of God among men. We mistake, if we think preparation for heaven is carried on only by contemplation and acts of devotion. The chariot and horses appeared like fire, something very glorious, not for burning, but brightness. By the manner in which Elijah and Enoch were taken from this world, God gave a glimpse of the eternal life brought to light by the gospel, of the glory reserved for the bodies of the saints, and of the opening of the kingdom of heaven to all believers. It was also a figure of Christ's ascension. Though Elijah was gone triumphantly to heaven, yet this world could ill spare him. Surely their hearts are hard, who feel not, when God, by taking away faithful, useful men, calls for weeping and mourning. Elijah was to Israel, by his counsels, reproofs, and prayers, better than the strongest force of chariot and horse, and kept off the judgments of God. Christ bequeathed to his disciples his precious gospel, like Elijah's mantle; the token of the Divine power being exerted to overturn the empire of Satan, and to set up the kingdom of God in the world. The same gospel remains with us, though the miraculous powers are withdrawn, and it has Divine strength for the conversion and salvation of sinners.</body></html>
