"When the time came," he means to say, "for Elijah's translation, of which you, my readers, all know, the following were the circumstances under which it took place." The fact itself was deeply impressed on the Jewish consciousness. "Elias," says the Sou of Sirach, "was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot of fiery homes" (Ecclus. 48:9). He was ranked with Enoch, as not having seen death (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:2. &sect; 2), and was viewed as "continuing in heaven a mysterious life, which no death had ever interrupted, whence he was ready at any time to return to earth" (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 113). The scribes thought that he was beyond all doubt to make his appearance upon the earth in person, before the coming of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-10.htm">Matthew 16:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By a whirlwind.</span> <span class="accented">Sa'arach</span> is not so much an actual "whirlwind" as a storm or atmospheric disturbance (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). It is a word which only occurs here in the historical Scriptures. <span class="cmt_word">That Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</span> Elisha had become to Elijah what Joshua was to Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>) - his "minister," or regular attendant, from the time of his call at Abel-meholah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-21.htm">1 Kings 19:21</a>). Elijah had no fixed residence, but moved from place to place as the Spirit of God suggested. His wanderings had now brought him to Gilgal (probably <span class="accented">Jiljilieh</span>, near Nablous), one of the most ancient sanctuaries of the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>, etc.), celebrated in the history of Saul and Samuel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 The Lord had let Elijah know that his time was at hand. He therefore went to the different schools of the prophets to give them his last exhortations and blessing. The removal of Elijah was a type and figure of the ascension of Christ, and the opening of the kingdom of heaven to all believers. Elisha had long followed Elijah, and he would not leave him now when he hoped for the parting blessing. Let not those who follow Christ come short by tiring at last. The waters of Jordan, of old, yielded to the ark; now, to the prophet's mantle, as a token of God's presence. When God will take up his faithful ones to heaven, death is the Jordan which they must pass through, and they find a way through it. The death of Christ has divided those waters, that the ransomed of the Lord may pass over. O death, where is thy sting, thy hurt, thy terror!</body></html>
