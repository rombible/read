(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.,</span> where Jehovah appears in a "whirlwind," which is described as a great fiery cloud; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 38:1</a>, where He answers Job "out of the whirlwind;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm" title="And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.">Nehemiah 1:3</a> : "The Lord hath His path in whirlwind and in storm (<span class= "ital">s?'?r?h</span>), and the clouds are the dust of His feet.") The Hebrew mind recognised the presence and working of Jehovah in the terrific phenomena of nature; the thunder-cloud or storm-wind was His chariot, the thunder His voice, the lightning His arrow. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/18-6.htm" title="In my distress I called on the LORD, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.">Psalm 18:6-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm" title="Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters: who makes the clouds his chariot: who walks on the wings of the wind:">Psalm 104:3</a>.) We must therefore be cautious of taking the words before us in too literal a sense. The essential meaning of the passage is this, that God suddenly took Elijah to Himself, amid a grand display of His power in and through the forces of nature. The popular conception, which we see embodied in such pictures as William Blake's Translation of Elijah, that the prophet ascended to heaven in a fiery car drawn by horses of fire, is plainly read into, rather than gathered from, the sacred text.<p><span class= "bld">Went up.</span>--Bahr <span class= "ital">may</span> be right in asserting that '<span class= "ital">?l?h</span> here means "disappeared, was consumed" (like the German <span class= "ital">aufgehen</span>). He compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-40.htm" title="But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.">Judges 20:40</a>, "The whole city <span class= "ital">went up heavenward</span>," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, was consumed, and the Hebrew name of the burnt offering (<span class= "ital">'ol?h</span>). But the same phrase ("to go up to heaven") is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm" title="They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.">Psalm 107:26</a> of a ship rising heavenward on the stormy waves.<p>As regards the miraculous removal of Elijah and Enoch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm" title="And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.">Genesis 5:24</a>), Von Gerlach remarks: "All such questions as whither they were removed, and where they now are, and what changes they underwent in translation, are left unanswered by the Scriptures." It may be added, that the ascension of Elijah into heaven is nowhere alluded to in the rest of the Bible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50, 51</a>,). The antitype answers to the type in little details as well as in the general outline. <span class="cmt_word">That behold, there appeared a chariot of firs, and horses of fire.</span> God's "angels are spirits, and his ministers <span class="accented">a flaming fire"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>). When the eyes of Elisha's servant were opened, and he saw the angelic host that protected his master, it appeared to him that "the mountain was full of horses and chariots <span class="accented">of fire</span> round about Elisha" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Material fire is, of course, not to be thought cf. But the glory and brightness of celestial beings, when made visible to man, has some analogy with fire, or at any rate brings the conception of fire before the mind. The historian doubtless reports the account which Elisha gave of what he saw on this memorable occasion. <span class="cmt_word">And parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and Elijah went up in a storm into the heavens</span>. There is no mention of a "whirlwind;" and "the heavens" are primarily the visible firmament or sky which overhangs the earth. Elijah, like our Lord, rose bodily from the earth into the upper region of the air, and was there lost to sight. Three only of the seed of Adam - Enoch, Elijah, Jesus - have passed from earth to heaven without dying. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:9-12 That fulness, from whence prophets and apostles had all their supply, still exists as of old, and we are told to ask large supplies from it. Diligent attendance upon Elijah, particularly in his last hours, would be proper means for Elisha to obtain much of his spirit. The comforts of departing saints, and their experiences, help both to gild our comforts and to strengthen our resolutions. Elijah is carried to heaven in a fiery chariot. Many questions might be asked about this, which could not be answered. Let it suffice that we are told, what his Lord, when he came, found him doing. He was engaged in serious discourse, encouraging and directing Elisha about the kingdom of God among men. We mistake, if we think preparation for heaven is carried on only by contemplation and acts of devotion. The chariot and horses appeared like fire, something very glorious, not for burning, but brightness. By the manner in which Elijah and Enoch were taken from this world, God gave a glimpse of the eternal life brought to light by the gospel, of the glory reserved for the bodies of the saints, and of the opening of the kingdom of heaven to all believers. It was also a figure of Christ's ascension. Though Elijah was gone triumphantly to heaven, yet this world could ill spare him. Surely their hearts are hard, who feel not, when God, by taking away faithful, useful men, calls for weeping and mourning. Elijah was to Israel, by his counsels, reproofs, and prayers, better than the strongest force of chariot and horse, and kept off the judgments of God. Christ bequeathed to his disciples his precious gospel, like Elijah's mantle; the token of the Divine power being exerted to overturn the empire of Satan, and to set up the kingdom of God in the world. The same gospel remains with us, though the miraculous powers are withdrawn, and it has Divine strength for the conversion and salvation of sinners.</body></html>
