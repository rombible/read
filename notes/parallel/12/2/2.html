a mark of different origin.<p><span class= "bld">Tarry here, I pray thee.</span>--This was said, not to test Elisha's affection, nor from a motive of humility, that Elisha might not witness his glorious ascension, but because Elijah was uncertain whether it was God's will that Elisha should go with him.

Not merely to "see once more this holiest place in Israel, the spiritual centre of the kingdom of the ten tribes" (<span class= "ital">Ewald</span>), but to visit the prophetic schools, or guilds, established there, and at Gilgal and Jericho, and to confirm their fidelity to Jehovah. Gilgal and Beth-el, as ancient Canaanite sanctuaries, were centres of illegal worship of the God of Israel. The guilds of the prophets may have been intended to counteract this evil influence at its head-quarters (<span class= "ital">Bahr</span>).<p><span class= "bld">As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-30.htm" title="And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.

Under ordinary circumstances, the servant would naturally have obeyed his lord, and submitted to a temporary separation; but Elisha has a presentiment, or something stronger than a presentiment, of what is impending (vers. 3, 5), and will not be induced to accelerate by a single moment the time of the last parting. He will remain with his master, ready to do him all needful service, until the end. <span class="cmt_word">To Bethel.</span> Bethel was the spiritual center of the kingdom of the ten tribes. There may have been many reasons why Elijah should visit it once more before he quitted the earth. He may have had directions to leave, consolation to give, words of warning to speak. We must not suppose that the narrative before us is complete. <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth.</span> These were ordinary forms of earnest asseveration with the Israelites, generally used separately (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-26.htm">1 Samuel 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-6.htm">1 Samuel 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-21.htm">1 Samuel 20:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-11.htm">2 Samuel 11:11</a>, etc.); but on occasions of special solemnity united, as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-26.htm">1 Samuel 25:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-30.htm">2 Kings 4:30</a>). The prophet is not to be blamed for using them, since the command, "Swear not at all," had not yet been given. <span class="cmt_word">I will not leave thee.</span> The resolve indicates strong attachment, deep fidelity, combined, perhaps, with a reasonable curiosity to see how the end would be brought about. <span class="cmt_word">So they went down to Bethel.</span> The expression, "went down," shows that the Gilgal of ver. 1 is not that of the Jordan valley, but the mountain-city between Sichem and Bethel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 The Lord had let Elijah know that his time was at hand. He therefore went to the different schools of the prophets to give them his last exhortations and blessing. The removal of Elijah was a type and figure of the ascension of Christ, and the opening of the kingdom of heaven to all believers. Elisha had long followed Elijah, and he would not leave him now when he hoped for the parting blessing. Let not those who follow Christ come short by tiring at last. The waters of Jordan, of old, yielded to the ark; now, to the prophet's mantle, as a token of God's presence. When God will take up his faithful ones to heaven, death is the Jordan which they must pass through, and they find a way through it. The death of Christ has divided those waters, that the ransomed of the Lord may pass over. O death, where is thy sting, thy hurt, thy terror!</body></html>
