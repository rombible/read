Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a>.) The Targum renders "greens." The LXX. retains the Hebrew word; the Syriac and Arabic render "mallows." Thenius thinks that <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, the reading of the LXX., points to another word derived from a different root, and meaning "to pluck," so that the word would denote <span class= "ital">legumina</span>.<p><span class= "bld">A wild vine.</span>--Vulg., "quasi vitem silvestrem," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, a running plant, like a vine.<p><span class= "bld">Wild gourds.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-18.htm" title="And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.">1Kings 6:18</a> a related word is used to describe one of the decorations of the Temple ("knops").<p>Wild gourds, or cucumbers (<span class= "ital">cucumeres agrestes</span>, or <span class= "ital">asinini</span>), are oval in shape, and taste bitter. Their Hebrew name (<span class= "ital">paqq-'oth</span>) is expressive of the fact that when ripe they are apt to <span class= "ital">burst</span> upon being touched. If eaten they act as a violent purgative. They were mistaken on the present occasion for edible gourds, a favourite food of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-5.htm" title="We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:">Numbers 11:5</a>). The Vulg. renders "colocynth," or coloquintida, a plant of the same family, bearing large orange-like fruits, which are very bitter, and cause colic (<span class= "ital">cucumis colocynthi, L</span>.). Keil supposes this to be the "wild vine" intended.<p><span class= "bld">They knew them not.</span>--And so did not stop the young man from his shredding.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one went out into the field to gather herbs.</span> One of the sons of the prophets, probably, went out into the neighboring country, and looked about for any wild fruits or vegetables that he could see anywhere. <span class="cmt_word">And found a wild vine.</span> Not a wild grape vine (<span class="accented">Vitis labrusea</span>), the fruit of which would have been harmless, but some cucurbitaceous plant, with tendrils, and a growth like that of the vine. <span class="cmt_word">And gathered thereof wild gourds.</span> The exact kind of gourd is uncertain. Recent critics have mostly come to the conclusion that the vegetable intended is the <span class="accented">Cucumis agrestis</span> or <span class="accented">Ecbalium elaterium</span>, the "squirting cucumber" of English naturalists. This is a kind of gourd, the fruit of which is egg-shaped, has a bitter taste, and bursts when ripe at a slight touch, squirting out sap and seeds. The main ground for this conclusion is etymologieal, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> being derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5e2;</span>, "to crack" or "split." Another theory, and one which has the ancient versions in its favor, identifies the "gourd" in question with the fruit of the colocynth, which is a gourd-like plant that creeps along the ground, and has a round yellow fruit of the size of a large orange. This fruit is exceedingly bitter, produces colic, and affects the nerves<span class="cmt_word">.

Elisha made hurtful food to become safe and wholesome. If a mess of pottage be all our dinner, remember that this great prophet had no better for himself and his guests. The table often becomes a snare, and that which should be for our welfare, proves a trap: this is a good reason why we should not feed ourselves without fear. When we are receiving the supports and comforts of life, we must keep up an expectation of death, and a fear of sin. We must acknowledge God's goodness in making our food wholesome and nourishing; I am the Lord that healeth thee. Elisha also made a little food go a great way. Having freely received, he freely gave. God has promised his church, that he will abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her poor with bread, Ps 132:15; whom he feeds, he fills; and what he blesses, comes to much. Christ's feeding his hearers was a miracle far beyond this, but both teach us that those who wait upon God in the way of duty, may hope to be supplied by Divine Providence.</body></html>
