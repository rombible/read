It occurs only here and in the opening chapters of the Book of Job (Job 1:6, 13; 2:1). The most literal rendering would be, <span class="accented">and the day came when</span>. Elisha passed to Shunem. Shunem was a village of Galilee, situated in the territory assigned to Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). It is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Solam</span>, at the south-eastern foot of the Gebel Duhy, or "Little Hermon," a "flourishing village encompassed by gardens" (Porter), and "in the midst of the finest corn-fields in the world" (Grove), on the edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. Elisha, in his progression to different parts of the northern kingdom, happened to come on one occasion to Shunem. <span class="cmt_word">Where was a great woman.</span> Houbigant strangely translates, "a tan woman," maintaining that a woman would not be called "great" in the sense of "wealthy" during her husband's lifetime; but no other commentator has accepted his view. The meaning seems to be that she was a woman of substance, one well-to-do, perhaps one that had brought her husband the bulk of his wealth. <span class="cmt_word">And she constrained him to eat bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she invited him in as he passed her house, and would take no denial. Compare Lot's pressing hospitality, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1-3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</span> Elisha, it appears, had frequent occasion to pass through Shunem on his way from Carmel to visit the cities of Galilee, or <span class="accented">versa</span>. It became his habit, on these journeys, to eat his meals at the house of the rich Shunammite. Hence arose a kindly feeling on both sides and a close intimacy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-17 Elisha was well thought of by the king of Israel for his late services; a good man can take as much pleasure in serving others, as in raising himself. But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.</body></html>
