(Comp. "the land of Shalisha," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-4.htm" title="And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.">1Samuel 9:4</a>. Its name, Shalisha--as if <span class= "ital">Three-land</span>--seems to allude to the three wadies, which there meet in the <span class= "ital">Wady Qurawa</span>.)<p><span class= "bld">Bread of the firstfruits.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-13.htm" title="And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be yours; every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.">Numbers 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm" title="The first fruit also of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him.">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>, according to which all firstfruits of grain were to be given to the priests and Levites. Such presents to prophets appear to have been usual in ordinary times. On the present occasion, which was "a time of dearth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm" title="And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.">2Kings 4:42</a> is connected by the construction with the preceding narrative), <span class= "ital">one</span> pious person brought his opportune gift to Elisha.<p><span class= "bld">And full ears of corn in the husk thereof</span>.--Heb., <span class= "ital">and karmel in his wallet</span>. The word karmel occurs besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm" title="And if you offer a meat offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the meat offering of your first fruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.">Leviticus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm" title="And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that you have brought an offering to your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:14</a>. The Targum and Syriac render "bruised grain;" the Jewish expositors "tender and fresh ears of corn." In some parts of England unripe corn is made into a dish called "frumenty." The word <span class= "ital">ciqlon</span> only occurs in this place. The Vulg. renders it by <span class= "ital">pera</span> ("wallet"). The LXX. (Alex.) repeats the Hebrew in Greek letters. The Vatican omits the word. It reads: "twenty barley loaves and cakes of pressed fruit" (<span class= "greekheb">???????</span>). The Syriac gives "garment."<p><span class= "bld">And he said</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Elisha said.<p><span class= "bld">Give unto the people.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-16.htm" title="But Jesus said to them, They need not depart; give you them to eat.">Matthew 14:16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42-44.</span> - 4. <span class="accented">The feeding of a hundred men on twenty loaves</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came a man from Baal-shalisha.</span> "Baal-shalisha" is reasonably identified with the "Beth-shalisha" of Eusebius and Jerome, which they place twelve Roman miles north of Diospolis, or Lydda (now Ludd). By "north" we must probably understand "northeast," since the "land of Shalisha" lay between the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>). The position thus indicated would not be very far from the Gilgal (<span class="accented">Jiljileh</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2</a>. and 2 Kings 4:38. <span class="cmt_word">And brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits.</span> It is clear that the more pious among the Israelites not only looked to the prophets for religious instruction (ver. 23), but regarded them as having inherited the position of the Levitical priests whom Jeroboam's innovations had driven from the country. The firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil were assigned by the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4, 5</a>) to the priests. <span class="cmt_word">Twenty loaves of barley.</span> The "loaves" of the Israelites were cakes or rolls, rather than "loaves" in the modern sense of the word. Each partaker of a meal usually had one for himself. Naturally, twenty "loaves" would be barely sufficient for twenty men. <span class="cmt_word">And full ears of corn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a few ripe ears of the same corn as that whereof the bread was made. Ears of corn were offered as firstfruits at the Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>), and were regarded as the most natural and becoming tokens of gratitude for God's harvest mercies. <span class="cmt_word">In the husk thereof</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in his bag</span>, or <span class="accented">in his sack</span> (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Give unto the people</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to the sons of the prophets who dwelt at Gilgal - <span class="cmt_word">that they may eat.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:38-44 There was a famine of bread, but not of hearing the word of God, for Elisha had the sons of the prophets sitting before him, to hear his wisdom. Elisha made hurtful food to become safe and wholesome. If a mess of pottage be all our dinner, remember that this great prophet had no better for himself and his guests. The table often becomes a snare, and that which should be for our welfare, proves a trap: this is a good reason why we should not feed ourselves without fear. When we are receiving the supports and comforts of life, we must keep up an expectation of death, and a fear of sin. We must acknowledge God's goodness in making our food wholesome and nourishing; I am the Lord that healeth thee. Elisha also made a little food go a great way. Having freely received, he freely gave. God has promised his church, that he will abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her poor with bread, Ps 132:15; whom he feeds, he fills; and what he blesses, comes to much. Christ's feeding his hearers was a miracle far beyond this, but both teach us that those who wait upon God in the way of duty, may hope to be supplied by Divine Providence.</body></html>
