But it seems better to take the word as a verb: "save (whereby) I may anoint myself with oil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-15.htm" title="You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but you shall not anoint you with oil; and sweet wine, but shall not drink wine.">Micah 6:15</a>). Vulgate, "parum olei, quo ungar." The Jews, like the Greeks and Romans, anointed themselves after the bath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-20.htm" title="Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.">2Samuel 12:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee?</span> Elisha acknowledges at once the call upon him to do something for the woman. This is, no doubt, in part, because she is a widow. Widows were, in the Law, especially commended to the attention and care of the faithful. As Bahr says, "It is a well-known feature of the Mosaic Law, one which is distinctly prominent, that it often and urgently commands to succor the widows and the fatherless, and to care for them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>). They are mentioned as representatives of the forsaken, the oppressed, and the necessitous as a class (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm">Matthew 3:5</a>; Baruch 6:37). It is especially emphasized and praised in Jehovah, that he is the Father and Judge (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Protector of the rights) of the widows and the fatherless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-17.htm">Isaiah 9:17</a>, etc.). Neglect and contempt of them are counted among the heaviest offences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-6.htm">Psalm 94:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-9.htm">Job 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a>); just as, on the other hand, compassion and care for them is a sign of the true fear of God, and of true piety. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16</a>; Tobit 1:7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Elisha could also gather from the tone of the woman's address that she, like her late husband, was God-fearing. <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, what hast thou in the house?</span> Hast thou anything, that is, which thou canst soil, and so pay the debt? <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Thins handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil</span>; literally, <span class="accented">save an anointing of oil</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so much oil as will suffice for one anointing of my person. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 Elisha's miracles were acts of real charity: Christ's were so; not only great wonders, but great favours to those for whom they were wrought. God magnifies his goodness with his power. Elisha readily received a poor widow's complaint. Those that leave their families under a load of debt, know not what trouble they cause. It is the duty of all who profess to follow the Lord, while they trust to God for daily bread, not to tempt him by carelessness or extravagance, nor to contract debts; for nothing tends more to bring reproach upon the gospel, or distresses their families more when they are gone. Elisha put the widow in a way to pay her debt, and to maintain herself and her family. This was done by miracle, but so as to show what is the best method to assist those who are in distress, which is, to help them to improve by their own industry what little they have. The oil, sent by miracle, continued flowing as long as she had empty vessels to receive it. We are never straitened in God, or in the riches of his grace; all our straitness is in ourselves. It is our faith that fails, not his promise. He gives more than we ask: were there more vessels, there is enough in God to fill them; enough for all, enough for each; and the Redeemer's all-sufficiency will only be stayed from the supplying the wants of sinners and saving their souls, when no more apply to him for salvation. The widow must pay her debt with the money she received for her oil. Though her creditors were too hard with her, yet they must be paid, even before she made any provision for her children. It is one of the main laws of the Christian religion, that we pay every just debt, and give every one his own, though we leave ever so little for ourselves; and this, not of constraint, but for conscience' sake. Those who bear an honest mind, cannot with pleasure eat their daily bread, unless it be their own bread. She and her children must live upon the rest; that is, upon the money received for the oil, with which they must put themselves into a way to get an honest livelihood. We cannot now expect miracles, yet we may expect mercies, if we wait on God, and seek to him. Let widows in particular depend upon him. He that has all hearts in his hand, can, without a miracle, send as effectual a supply.</body></html>
