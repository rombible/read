And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,">1Kings 18:42</a>.) This expression summarises the preceding details.<p><span class= "bld">The flesh of the child waxed warm</span>.--The life of the Divine Spirit which was in Elisha was miraculously imparted by contact to the lifeless body. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands</span>; following the example set him by his master and predecessor, Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>). The idea may in both cases have been to fit the Body for reinhabitation by the soul (see ver. 22), through the restoration of warmth to it. <span class="cmt_word">And he stretched himself upon the child</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> brought his flesh as close as he could to the flesh of the child, covering the body and pressing on it, to force his own bodily warmth to pass into it. The word used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, is different from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>, which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, and implies a closer contact. <span class="cmt_word">And the flesh of the child waxed warm.</span> Elisha's efforts had an effect; the child's Body was actually warmed by them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:18-37 Here is the sudden death of the child. All the mother's tenderness cannot keep alive a child of promise, a child of prayer, one given in love. But how admirably does the prudent, pious mother, guard her lips under this sudden affliction! Not one peevish word escapes from her. Such confidence had she of God's goodness, that she was ready to believe that he would restore what he had now taken away. O woman, great is thy faith! He that wrought it, would not disappoint it. The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. She had not thought it enough to have Elisha's help sometimes in her own family, but, though a woman of rank, attended on public worship. It well becomes the men of God, to inquire about the welfare of their friends and their families. The answer was, It is well. All well, and yet the child dead in the house! Yes! All is well that God does; all is well with them that are gone, if they are gone to heaven; and all well with us that stay behind, if, by the affliction, we are furthered in our way thither. When any creature-comfort is taken from us, it is well if we can say, through grace, that we did not set our hearts too much upon it; for if we did, we have reason to fear it was given in anger, and taken away in wrath. Elisha cried unto God in faith; and the beloved son was restored alive to his mother. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls, must feel deeply for their case, and labour fervently in prayer for them. Though the minister cannot give Divine life to his fellow-sinners, he must use every means, with as much earnestness as if he could do so.</body></html>
