(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-11.htm" title="And the LORD shall guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in drought, and make fat your bones: and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.">Isaiah 58:11</a>.) We can imagine the emotion with which this would be said. (Comp. the incredulity of Sarah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12-13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Elisha - <span class="cmt_word">said, About this season, according to the time of life</span> - rather, <span class="accented">when the time comes round</span>; literally, <span class="accented">revives</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="cmt_word">about this time next year</span> - <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt embrace a son</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a son shall be born to thee, whom thou wilt embrace, as mothers are wont to do." <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.</span> Like Sarah, the woman was incredulous; she could not believe the good tidings, and thought the prophet was only raising hopes to disappoint them. Her words, "Do not lie unto thy servant," are less harsh in the original, being merely equivalent to the "Do not deceive me" of ver. 28. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-17 Elisha was well thought of by the king of Israel for his late services; a good man can take as much pleasure in serving others, as in raising himself. But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.</body></html>
