It is hardly likely that Elisha communicated with her through his servant in order to save his own dignity. He may have thought she would express her wishes more freely to Gehazi than to himself.<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast been careful . . . with all this care.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">trembled all this trembling</span>.

Is there anything that we can do for thee in return? <span class="cmt_word">Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king?</span> Elisha assumes that he has credit at court, and offers to use it in the Shunammite's favor, if she has any request to prefer. We see something of his influence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-9.htm">2 Kings 6:9-12, 21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4-6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Or to the captain of the host?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the person whose authority and influence was next to that of the king. <span class="cmt_word">And she answered, I dwell among mine own people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The court is nothing to me. I want nothing from it. I have no wrong to complain of, no quarrel with any of my neighbors, so as to need the help of one m power. I dwell peaceably among them. They are 'my own people' - friends or dependents." The reply is that of one perfectly content with her position. Perhaps she aims at impressing on Elisha that she has had no selfish motive in what she has done for him, but has merely wished to honor God in his prophet. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-17 Elisha was well thought of by the king of Israel for his late services; a good man can take as much pleasure in serving others, as in raising himself. But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.</body></html>
