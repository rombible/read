"A lover of good" or benevolence generally; the appellation points here to that large heart which finds room for sympathy with all that is good and noble and generous.<p><span class= "bld">Sober.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">self-restrained.</span> In this expressive word (<span class= "ital">sophrona</span>)<span class= "ital"> mastery of self</span> is especially implied--that self-command which wisely regulates pleasures and passions.<p><span class= "bld">Just.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">righteous.</span> The man who is just (<span class= "ital">dikaios</span>) is one who tries strictly to perform his duties <span class= "ital">towards men</span>--the duties which integrity and justice seem imperatively to ask from him in his relations with his neighbour.<p><span class= "bld">Holy.</span>--The man who is <span class= "ital">holy</span> studies to be true and faithful <span class= "ital">in his relations to God, </span>which duties with us largely consist in keeping pure our bodies, the temple of the Holy Spirit. While the "just" man struggles after uprightness before men, the "holy" man aims at a holy purity before God.<p><span class= "bld">Temperate.</span>--This virtue is not to be understood in the usual and more limited sense which has been already specified in "not given to wine" of the preceding verse, but signifies the being temperate--moderate in all things. The model presbyter, the ruler of a congregation of Christians, not only must be able to control his tongue, his eyes, his hands, but must show a just and wise moderation even in pressing things which of themselves are excellent. To do his Master's work efficiently, he must be able at all times to command himself--to perform that most difficult of all tasks, the tempering zeal with discretion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- Given to</span> for <span class="accented">a lover of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">good</span> for <span class="accented">good men</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sober-minded</span> for <span class="accented">sober</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Given to hospitality</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">A lover of good</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm">2 Timothy 3:3</a>, note on <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Only here in the New Testament, and only once in the LXX., Wisd. 7:22, where it seems to mean "a lover of that which is good," and where the long string of adjectives is very similar to that here; found occasionally in classical Greek. <span class="cmt_word">Sober-minded</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2, 5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, note.

Temperate (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and never in this sense in the LXX.; but it has exactly the same meaning in Aristotle, viz. "master of one's self," having the appetites under control. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-9 The character and qualification of pastors, here called elders and bishops, agree with what the apostle wrote to Timothy. Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel. And here are described the spirit and practice becoming such as should be examples of good works.</body></html>
