It was no longer individuals that their poisonous teaching affected, but they were undermining the faith of whole families. For an example how Titus and his presbyters were to stop the mouths of these teachers of what was false, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-34.htm" title="But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.">Matthew 22:34-46</a>, where the Lord, by His wise, powerful, yet gentle words, first put the Sadducees to silence, and then so answered the Pharisees that "neither durst any man from that day forth ask Him any more questions."<p><span class= "bld">Teaching things which</span> <span class= "bld">they</span> <span class= "bld">ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</span>--Here St. Paul goes to the root of the evil, when he shows what was the end and aim of these "teachers" life. It was a mean and sordid ambition, after all--merely base gain. When this is the main object of a religious teacher's life, his teaching naturally accommodates itself to men's tastes. He forgets the Divine Giver of his commission, and in his thirst for the popularity which brings with it gold, his true work, as the faithful watchman of the house of Israel, is forgotten and ignored.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Men who overthrow</span> for <span class="accented">who subvert</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Whose mouths must be stopped</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); here only in the New Testament, not found in the LXX., but common in classical Greek.

Such should be resisted, and put to shame, by sound doctrine from the Scriptures. Shameful actions, the reproach of heathens, should be far from Christians; falsehood and lying, envious craft and cruelty, brutal and sensual practices, and idleness and sloth, are sins condemned even by the light of nature. But Christian meekness is as far from cowardly passing over sin and error, as from anger and impatience. And though there may be national differences of character, yet the heart of man in every age and place is deceitful and desperately wicked. But the sharpest reproofs must aim at the good of the reproved; and soundness in the faith is most desirable and necessary. To those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; they abuse, and turn things lawful and good into sin. Many profess to know God, yet in their lives deny and reject him. See the miserable state of hypocrites, such as have a form of godliness, but are without the power; yet let us not be so ready to fix this charge on others, as careful that it does not apply to ourselves.</body></html>
