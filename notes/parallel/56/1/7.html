In the Pastoral Epistles written between A.D. 63-67 these terms are clearly applied indifferently to the same person. The title presbyter refers to the gravity and dignity of the office; the title bishop suggests rather the duties which belong to an elder of the church. On the question of bishops, and their position in the early Church, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1Timothy 3:1</a>, where the grounds for assuming that the episcopal order was formally introduced into church government before the end of this century, and during the lifetime of St. John, are discussed. The Christian bishop, within a quarter of a century after the death of St. Paul, assumed many of the functions and generally discharged the duties of government which were exercised by the Apostles during their lifetime. The presbyter--then writes St. Paul--seeing he is appointed an overseer or bishop (the use of the latter term bishop in the ecclesiastical sense is, however, premature), as God's steward, as a responsible administrator of the House, that is, of the Church of the Living God, ought indeed be blameless.<p><span class= "bld">Not selfwilled.</span>--He should not be one of those self-loving men who seeks to gratify his own personal ends in the first place, and in consequence is usually regardless of others.<p><span class= "bld">Not soon angry.</span>--Not soon provoked, or not irascible. He should not be one ever ready with an angry, hasty word, remembering always his Master, "who when He was reviled, reviled not again."<p><span class= "bld">Not given to wine.</span>--While the presbyter is not to be chosen on account of any stern austerities or rigid asceticism he may have practised, he must be known as one "temperate," moderate, self-denying.<p><span class= "bld">No striker.</span>--Not a brawler. No man of God--above all things, no one holding office in the church--should ever, even under sore provocation, so far forget himself as to raise his hand against his fellow.<p><span class= "bld">Not given to filthy lucre.</span>--The presbyter of the House of God must be above all dreaming of mean and paltry gains. He who is to administer the alms devoted to God must surely do it with clean hands. There is, too, another and a deeper meaning in the words. The presbyter whose mind is at all devoted to the amassing of gold is too preoccupied to be able to fix his thoughts upon those high things of God committed to his charge, among which one of his most important duties is to instruct the flock.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The for a, A.V.: <span class="accented">God's steward</span> for <span class="accented">the steward of God</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">no brawler</span> for <span class="accented">not given to wine</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">greedy of</span> for <span class="accented">given to</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Blameless</span> (see ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">God's steward</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>.

Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel. And here are described the spirit and practice becoming such as should be examples of good works.</body></html>
