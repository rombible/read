The First Person of the blessed Trinity fitly possesses the title of "our Saviour," because through the death of His dear Son He redeemed us from death and made us heirs of eternal life. The Second Person of the Trinity is likewise a possessor of the title, because He shed His blood as the price of our redemption. The epithet of "Saviour"--the title just given to the Father, in the very next verse ascribed to the "Son"--is one of the many indications we possess of St. Paul's belief that the Son was equal to the Father as touching His Godhead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">his own seasons</span> for <span class="accented">hath due times</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in the message</span> for <span class="accented">through preaching</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">wherewith</span> 1 <span class="accented">was entrusted</span> for <span class="accented">which is committed unto me</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In his own seasons.</span> The margin, <span class="accented">its own seasons</span>, is preferable (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>, note). The phrase is equivalent to "the fullness of the time" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Manifested his Word.</span> There is a change of construction. "The relative sentence passes almost imperceptibly into a primary sentence" (Buttmann in Huther); "his Word" becomes the object of the verb "made manifest," instead of "eternal life," as one would have expected. <span class="cmt_word">His Word</span> is the whole revelation of the gospel, including the Person and work of Jesus Christ. Compare St. Peter's address to Cornelius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>). This "Word," which lay in the mind of God through the ages, and was only dimly expressed in the promises given from time to time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>), was now "<span class="accented">made</span> manifest," and proclaimed openly in that preaching of the gospel of God's grace which was entrusted to St. Paul. This same idea is frequently expressed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>), <span class="cmt_word">In the message.</span> Surely a poor and a false rendering. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> means "by the open proclamation" which St. Paul, as God's herald, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, was commanded to make. But this is better expressed by the word which is appropriated to the proclamation of the gospel, viz. "preaching." So, as above quoted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>, and elsewhere frequently. <span class="cmt_word">According to the commandment</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>.); <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">God our Savior</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-3.htm">1 Timothy 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm">Titus 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-25.htm">Jude 1:25</a>; and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-47.htm">Luke 1:47</a>). Elsewhere in the New Testament the term "<span class="accented">Savior"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>) is always applied to our Lord Jesus Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 All are the servants of God who are not slaves of sin and Satan. All gospel truth is according to godliness, teaching the fear of God. The intent of the gospel is to raise up hope as well as faith; to take off the mind and heart from the world, and to raise them to heaven and the things above. How excellent then is the gospel, which was the matter of Divine promise so early, and what thanks are due for our privileges! Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and whoso is appointed and called, must preach the word. Grace is the free favour of God, and acceptance with him. Mercy, the fruits of the favour, in the pardon of sin, and freedom from all miseries both here and hereafter. And peace is the effect and fruit of mercy. Peace with God through Christ who is our Peace, and with the creatures and ourselves. Grace is the fountain of all blessings. Mercy, and peace, and all good, spring out of this.</body></html>
