The verse quoted is an hexameter, written by the famous Epimenides, of Gnossus, in Crete. He flourished some 600 years B.C., and is said to have lived to the strange age of 150 years or more. He appears to have deserved the title of prophet in its fullest sense--Plato speaking of him as a "divine man," and Cicero coupling him with the Erythaean Sibyl. The first three words were well known, and even used by Callimachus in his hymn to Zeus, "Cretans always liars." St. Paul's knowledge of the poem where the verse occurs is one of the several instances which we meet with in his writings indicating his familiarity with profane literature. The quotation, occurring as it does in the midst of an inspired writing, was the occasion of Calvin's wise, brave words, which style those who decline to avail themselves of the learning and research of profane writers as superstitious. Nothing wise and learned, he says, should be rejected, even though it proceed "ab impiis."<p><span class= "bld">The Cretians are alway</span> <span class= "bld">liars.</span>--This terrible estimate of the national Cretan character is amply borne out by the testimony of many profane writers, such as Callimachus, Plato, Polybius, Ovid, &c. The very word "to Cretize" (<span class= "ital">kretizein</span>), or to play the part of a Cretan, was invented as a word synonymous with "to deceive," "to utter a lie;" just as <span class= "ital">corinthiazein.</span> "to play the part of a Corinthian," signified to commit a still darker moral offence. Some writers suggest that this despicable vice of lying was received as a bequest from the early Ph?nician colonists.<p><span class= "bld">Evil beasts.</span>--These words refer to their wild, fierce nature, their ferocity, their love of cruelty.<p><span class= "bld">Slow bellies.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">idle bellies.</span> These terms paint with sharp accuracy another of the evil characteristics of the Cretan peoples--their dull gluttony, their slothful sensuality. The words are used especially of those who, by indulging their bodily appetites, become corpulent and indolent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - A <span class="accented">prophet</span> for <span class="accented">even a prophet</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Cretan, s</span> for <span class="accented">the Cretinous</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">idle gluttons</span> for <span class="accented">slow bellies</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A prophet of their own</span>; viz. Epimenides, a native either of Phaestus or of Cnossus in Crete, the original author of this line, which is also quoted by Callimachus. Epimenides is here called a prophet, not simply as a poet, but from his peculiar character as priest, bard, and seer; called by Plato <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, and coupled by Cicero with Bacis the B.C.eotian prophet, and the sibyl (Bishop Ellicott); described by other ancient writers as a prophet (Alford); "everything we hear of him is of a priestly or religious nature" ('Dict. of Gr. and Romans Biogr. and Mythol.'). <span class="cmt_word">Cretans are always liars</span>, etc. So truly was this their characteristic, that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> was used to denote" telling lies" - "to lie like a Cretan" (Plutarch, etc.). From their general bad character arose the line, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>; and Livy, Polybius, and Plutarch alike hear witness to their covetousness and dishonesty: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>; "When was there ever an upright Cretan?" asks Leonides in an ' Epigram' (Farrar, ' St. Paul,' vol. it. p. 534). <span class="cmt_word">Evil beasts</span>. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is "a wild beast;" applied to men as a term of reproach (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>), it implies brutality, stupidity, unreasonableness, and, with the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;</span>, mischief, like the French <span class="accented">mechante bete.</span> The 'Epigram' above quoted calls them <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "pirates and wreckers." <span class="cmt_word">Idle gluttons</span>; literally, <span class="accented">idle bellies.</span> The substantive denotes their gluttony and sensuality (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>), and the adjective their sloth (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>); in old Greek it is usually of the common gender. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-16 False teachers are described. Faithful ministers must oppose such in good time, that their folly being made manifest, they may go no further They had a base end in what they did; serving a worldly interest under pretence of religion: for the love of money is the root of all evil. Such should be resisted, and put to shame, by sound doctrine from the Scriptures. Shameful actions, the reproach of heathens, should be far from Christians; falsehood and lying, envious craft and cruelty, brutal and sensual practices, and idleness and sloth, are sins condemned even by the light of nature. But Christian meekness is as far from cowardly passing over sin and error, as from anger and impatience. And though there may be national differences of character, yet the heart of man in every age and place is deceitful and desperately wicked. But the sharpest reproofs must aim at the good of the reproved; and soundness in the faith is most desirable and necessary. To those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; they abuse, and turn things lawful and good into sin. Many profess to know God, yet in their lives deny and reject him. See the miserable state of hypocrites, such as have a form of godliness, but are without the power; yet let us not be so ready to fix this charge on others, as careful that it does not apply to ourselves.</body></html>
