From eusebes; piety; specially, the gospel scheme.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/titus/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ.</span>--The titles here assumed by St. Paul in his introductory greeting are in some respects slightly different to any of his usual designations. In the other two so-called Pastoral Epistles addressed to Timothy, St. Paul simply styles himself "an Apostle of Jesus Christ." Possibly, the longer and more formal title is here adopted because his relations were hardly ever of so intimate a character with Titus as with Timothy; the latter would seem to have held the position of St. Paul's <span class= "ital">adopted son.</span> (See Note below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm" title="To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.">Titus 1:4</a>, "To Titus.")<p><span class= "bld">According to the faith of God's elect.</span>--The English version here entirely fails to give the meaning of the Greek preposition. The rendering should be, "for (the furtherance of) the faith," or, in other words, "the object of my (Paul's) apostleship was, that through my instrumentality the chosen of God should believe." The whole question respecting these "elect," or "chosen of God," is surrounded with deep mystery; three or four guiding thoughts may, however, be safely laid down. (1) In the visible world such an <span class= "ital">apparently</span> arbitrary election to special privileges, fortune, happiness. utterly irrespective, in the first instance, of individual merit, does exist. This is clear to all of us. (2) In grace we are distinctly told repeatedly that a similar election exists, and our own observation certainly coincides here with revelation. (3) Such election in no case seemingly affects our position here as free agents; surrounded with the most precious privileges, gifted with much knowledge, it is possible, as we, alas, too often see, deliberately to refuse the good and to choose the evil. (4) All such allusions to the "elect" as, for instance, the one here before us, are intended, not as a stumbling-block for the believer, but as a comfort for the faithful, struggling man of God, for it tells him how the Eternal "before the ages" had chosen him to be His servant.<p><span class= "bld">And the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">and the full knowledge of the truth which is designed for godliness, </span>or, <span class= "ital">which leadeth to godliness.</span> Here the further purpose of St. Paul's apostleship is specified. St. Paul was appointed an Apostle that through him the elect of God might believe and heed "the truth"--that truth, the knowledge of which produces as its fruit in the individual a holy, useful life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">- Knowledge</span> for <span class="accented">acknowledging</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">according to</span> for <span class="accented">after</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A servant of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); so in the superscriptions: <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>. St. Paul also calls himself "the servant of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>); and the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>. But neither "servant of God" nor any equivalent is in the superscription of either 1 or 2 Timothy. "Servant" is a better rendering than "slave," as Farrar renders it. <span class="cmt_word">An apostle</span>, etc.; as in both 1 and 2 Timothy, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>, etc.; showing that this is not a private letter, but a public and official document, conveying official authority to Titus over the Church in Crete. <span class="cmt_word">According to the faith of God's elect.</span> The phrase is peculiar to this passage, and the exact force of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> is not easy to determine (see Bishop Ellicott's notes, who renders <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> "for," and explains that "the faith of God's elect is the destination of the apostleship," with the further explanation that this meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> is about equivalent to "with special reference to," or "destination for," as its object). It is nearly the same thing to say that the true faith, and the perfect knowledge of the truth, and the hope of eternal life promised by God, are the sphere in which the apostolic office moves and acts. "The faith of God's elect," etc., seems to imply that there was in some who were not elect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19, 20</a>) a corruption of the faith, a departure from it - a faith that was no faith, and something calling itself <span class="accented">truth</span> which was not "according to godliness," and so to point to rising heresies. The authors of these heresies were chiefly Jews (ver. 10), of whom there was a considerable colony in Crete (Conybeare and Howson, vol. it. p. 475; and Lewin, vol. 2. p. 337). According to godliness (for the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the pastoral Epistles, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm">1 Timothy 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3, 5, 6, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>, and notes). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 All are the servants of God who are not slaves of sin and Satan. All gospel truth is according to godliness, teaching the fear of God. The intent of the gospel is to raise up hope as well as faith; to take off the mind and heart from the world, and to raise them to heaven and the things above. How excellent then is the gospel, which was the matter of Divine promise so early, and what thanks are due for our privileges! Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and whoso is appointed and called, must preach the word. Grace is the free favour of God, and acceptance with him. Mercy, the fruits of the favour, in the pardon of sin, and freedom from all miseries both here and hereafter. And peace is the effect and fruit of mercy. Peace with God through Christ who is our Peace, and with the creatures and ourselves. Grace is the fountain of all blessings. Mercy, and peace, and all good, spring out of this.</body></html>
