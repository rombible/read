The oral law and traditional interpretations and glosses had, to a great measure, obscured the original simple text. The Israelite of the time of St. Paul, trained in the stricter Jewish schools, was taught that the way to win the approval of the Most High was through the observance of countless ceremonies and the practice of an elaborate ritual.<p><span class= "bld">And commandments of men.--</span>The nature of these commandments we gather from the words of the next (the 15th) verse. They seem to have been on the subject of abstinence from meats and from other things created by God for the use and enjoyment of man. The directions of St. Paul here are, in spirit, in exact accordance with the Lord's teaching at Jerusalem, related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-1.htm" title="Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,">Matthew 15:1-9</a>. St. Paul's dread of this kind of asceticism and of the peculiar school of teaching, then so popular among the Jews, which enjoined an elaborate system of ritual and observance, which pronounced meritorious in the sight of the Eternal the practice of rites and ceremonies minute and trifling, was grounded upon a fear--too often, alas, verified--lest with the observance of the ritual, and the careful practice of the ceremonies and rites, the moral law should be lost sight of. With this school a holy life consisted rather in observing carefully a ritual, than in living justly, nobly, generously.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- Who</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">turn away</span> for <span class="accented">turn</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Jewish fables</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>, where the Jewish origin of the fables is implied, though not so distinctly stated as here). <span class="cmt_word">Commandments of men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-22.htm">Colossians 2:22</a> the apostle speaks of the precepts "touch not," "taste not" (originating with the Judaizing teachers), as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (see following note). <span class="cmt_word">Turning away from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15</a>, note. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-16 False teachers are described.

Such should be resisted, and put to shame, by sound doctrine from the Scriptures. Shameful actions, the reproach of heathens, should be far from Christians; falsehood and lying, envious craft and cruelty, brutal and sensual practices, and idleness and sloth, are sins condemned even by the light of nature. But Christian meekness is as far from cowardly passing over sin and error, as from anger and impatience. And though there may be national differences of character, yet the heart of man in every age and place is deceitful and desperately wicked. But the sharpest reproofs must aim at the good of the reproved; and soundness in the faith is most desirable and necessary. To those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; they abuse, and turn things lawful and good into sin. Many profess to know God, yet in their lives deny and reject him. See the miserable state of hypocrites, such as have a form of godliness, but are without the power; yet let us not be so ready to fix this charge on others, as careful that it does not apply to ourselves.</body></html>
