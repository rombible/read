The elder must, St. Paul says, hold fast the faithful word or saying; or, in other words, must steadily adhere to that Christian doctrine taught by St. Paul and his brother Apostles. So St. Paul pressed on Timothy, the chief presbyter of Ephesus, "to hold the pattern of sound words which thou heardest from me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 1:13</a>); and again, "But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm" title="But continue you in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;">2Timothy 3:14</a>). Here "the faithful saying," that formulary so common in the Epistles to Timothy and to Titus, and which we have generally explained as including the great Christian watchwords of the faith, echoes probably of sayings of Christ, taken up and expanded by His chosen servants, and then adopted in the various churches and woven into the tapestry of the earliest liturgies--now, possibly, after a form like the "comfortable words" of our Communion Service, now into a creed, now into a hymn, but in one shape or other thoroughly well known and loved in the different congregations--here the faithful word or saying seems to include <span class= "ital">all</span> the faithful sayings, and denotes generally the teaching of St. Paul and the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">To exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</span>--Two special purposes are specified for which the "sound doctrine" which the elder will acquire by steadfast application may be used. The first, with the sound, healthy teaching--sound, healthy, practical, compared with that sickly, morbid, and unpractical teaching of those gainsayers of whom he is going to speak--he is <span class= "ital">to exhort</span> the adversaries; secondly, with the same true words he is <span class= "ital">to confute</span> their arguments. Chrysostom well remarks "that he who knows not how to contend with adversaries, and is not able to demolish their arguments, is far from the teacher's chair."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Holding to</span> for <span class="accented">holding fast</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which is according to the teaching</span> for <span class="accented">as he hath been taught</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">both to exhort in the sound doctrine</span> for <span class="accented">by sound doctrine, both to exhort</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">convict</span> for <span class="accented">convince</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Holding to</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">.

The A.V. gives substantially the apostle's meaning.

Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel. And here are described the spirit and practice becoming such as should be examples of good works.</body></html>
