Blameless must be his life, spotless his name. As it has been well said, "the office of presbyter must never be allowed to cover or condone damaged reputations."<p><span class= "bld">The husband of one wife.</span>--See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Having faithful children.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">believing children.</span> In searching out these presbyters, whose charge would involve so many and such responsible duties, Titus must look for men of ripe age. There were even grave objections to the appointment of the comparatively young to this office. We have seen how anxious St. Paul was for Timothy, his well-known and trusted friend, on account of his want of years. Timothy must have been at least approaching forty years of age when St. Paul warned him so earnestly of his behaviour and his life, "Let no man despise thy youth." These presiding Cretan elders should be married men, with children already, so to speak, grown up.<p>These requirements evidently show that Christianity had been established in Crete for a very considerable period. We must remember some thirty-three years had passed since that memorable Pentecost feast of Jerusalem, when "Cretes" were among the hearers of those marvellous utterances of the Spirit. Besides the children of the candidates for the presbyter's office being professing Christians, they must also be free from all suspicion of profligacy.<p><span class= "bld">Not accused of riot.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">dissoluteness.</span> The Greek word here rendered "riot" implies a self-indulgent or even a reckless expenditure. Such careless selfishness well-nigh always ends in profligacy. In the case of men whose duties included the superintendence of the Church's funds, it was imperatively necessary that their homes and families should be free from all suspicion of anything like that reckless waste or extravagance which in so many cases imperceptibly passes into dissoluteness and profligacy.<p><span class= "bld">Or unruly.</span>--That is, disobedient to their parents. If the presbyter was incapable of teaching his own children obedience and order, what hope was there that his influence would be of any value with his flock? All these early instructions to the master-builders whose task it was to lay the early storeys of the Christian Temple are very decisive as to the state of St. Paul's mind; and we must not forget <span class= "ital">whence</span> St. Paul directly drew his wisdom. The Apostles of the Lord never seem to have thought of the Christian priesthood of the future <span class= "ital">developing into a caste or</span> <span class= "ital">order.</span> Anything more diametrically opposed to the mediaeval notion of church government than the Pastoral Epistles can hardly be imagined. The writer of the Epistles to Timothy and to Titus never dreamed of building up a priestly order with views, thoughts, hopes, and joys differing from those of the ordinary worker of the world. St. Paul's presbyters were to be chosen, among other qualities, for the white and blameless lives of their families. The presbyter's home in Crete and Ephesus must supply a fair pattern for the many other Christian homes in that luxurious, dissolute age in which Titus lived.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Any man <span class="accented">is</span> for <span class="accented">any be</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">children that believe</span> for <span class="accented">faithful children</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">who are not</span> for <span class="accented">not</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Blameless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-10.htm">1 Timothy 3:10</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">The husband of one wife</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Having children that believe</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>).

Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel. And here are described the spirit and practice becoming such as should be examples of good works.</body></html>
