All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.">Romans 14:20</a>), was the groundwork of much of the Gentile Apostle's teaching. The words of the Lord Jesus above referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm" title="Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.">Matthew 15:11</a>) contain the same grand truth. "All things" include much besides mere food--in a word, include all acts connected with every-day life which in themselves are neither right nor wrong, neither good nor evil, but which derive their colouring of good or evil solely from the doer of the act. Bengel well sums this up in his "omnia externa eis, qui intus sunt mundi, munda sunt."<p><span class= "bld">But unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure.</span>--Here, as so often in these Pastoral Epistles, the last utterance, so to speak, of that grand life of St. Paul's, purity and sound doctrine are inseparable. Here "the defiled," "the polluted," we are told, are the unbelieving; and to these, the Apostle says, nothing is pure. Yet there is nothing in God's creation impure or evil--the evil and impurity are in the mind and heart of men; these may, and often do, defile and make impure the choicest gifts of God's creation. One word is still left to be said on the teaching of this memorable verse. <span class= "ital">Who</span> are the pure to whom all things are pure? Only those in this world who have sought cleansing by faith in the precious blood of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">But even their mind and conscience is defiled.</span>--Here St. Paul defines exactly the sphere over which the moral defilement of these hapless ones, who belong to the Christian company, alas, only in name, extends--the mind and conscience. The first of these--<span class= "ital">the mind</span>--is the willing as well as the thinking part of man, as it has been well defined the human spirit (<span class= "ital">pneuma</span>) in one of its aspects, not simply <span class= "ital">quatenus cogitat et intelligit, </span>but also <span class= "ital">quatenus vult.</span> Defilement of this mind (<span class= "ital">nous</span>) means that the thoughts, wishes, purposes, activities, are all stained and debased. The second of these--the conscience (<span class= "ital">suneid?sis</span>)--is the moral consciousness within, that which is ever bringing up the memory of the past, with its omissions and commissions, its errors, its cruel, heartless unkindness, its selfish disregard of others. When <span class= "ital">this</span> is defiled, then this last safeguard of the soul is broken down. The man and woman of the defiled conscience is <span class= "ital">self-satisfied, </span>hard, impenitent to the last.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="accented">- To</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V.

We learn also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>; and elsewhere, what were the kind of questions which agitated the Judaizing Christians. But St. Paul in a few wise words shows the utter worthlessness of such controversies. "To the pure all things are pure." "There is nothing from without a man," said our Lord, "that entering into him can defile him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-15.htm">Mark 7:15</a>); "Neither if we cat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>); "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>). But unto those that are defiled by what comes from within them, and have no faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>), nothing is pure. Their mind and conscience, being defiled, defile everything they do. The words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> are the proper words for ceremonial "cleanness" and "defilement" respectively. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-16 False teachers are described. Faithful ministers must oppose such in good time, that their folly being made manifest, they may go no further They had a base end in what they did; serving a worldly interest under pretence of religion: for the love of money is the root of all evil. Such should be resisted, and put to shame, by sound doctrine from the Scriptures. Shameful actions, the reproach of heathens, should be far from Christians; falsehood and lying, envious craft and cruelty, brutal and sensual practices, and idleness and sloth, are sins condemned even by the light of nature. But Christian meekness is as far from cowardly passing over sin and error, as from anger and impatience. And though there may be national differences of character, yet the heart of man in every age and place is deceitful and desperately wicked. But the sharpest reproofs must aim at the good of the reproved; and soundness in the faith is most desirable and necessary. To those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; they abuse, and turn things lawful and good into sin. Many profess to know God, yet in their lives deny and reject him. See the miserable state of hypocrites, such as have a form of godliness, but are without the power; yet let us not be so ready to fix this charge on others, as careful that it does not apply to ourselves.</body></html>
