Hearing this "faithful saying," thought? the old man St. Paul, my children in Christ will surely be disposed to be more loyal subjects, more faithful citizens, more loving neighbours, though their civil magistrates, their fellow-citizens, their neighbours, be still idolaters, living without God in the world. And there was yet another reason for the constant repetition of this "faithful saying:" men would see that they owed all their glorious Christian privileges, their present peace, their future hope, to God's free grace--that <span class= "ital">they</span> had done nothing to deserve all this. Surely such a thought would spur them on to noble deeds, if it were only to show they were not wholly ungrateful. So he writes, Yes, affirm constantly this faithful saying.<p><span class= "bld">That they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works.</span>--But not only would St. Paul have them show their gratitude for the great mercy they had received, but he is specially anxious that they who by God's grace had been led into the Christian company should now not only quietly and unobtrusively take their part in good works, but should ever be careful to be forward in all such things; he would have Christians conspicuous in their generous zeal to forward all good and useful undertakings. "Good works" here by no means is confined to works of mercy and charity though, of course, they include such, still they possess in this passage a far more comprehensive signification. All useful and beneficent undertakings, public as well as private, are reckoned among these "good works." As was observed before, St. Paul's ideal Christian must be a generous, public-spirited man. In the eyes of this great teacher the cloistered ascetic would have found but little favour; his hero, while ever the devoted, self-sacrificing lover of the Lord, must be known among his fellow-citizens "as careful to maintain good works."<p><span class= "bld">These things are good and profitable unto men.</span>--The accurate translation of the Greek here would be, <span class= "ital">These are the things which are good and profitable</span> <span class= "ital">unto men;</span> but the older authorities omit the article, <span class= "ital">ta, </span>before <span class= "ital">kala.</span> The rendering, then (omitting the article), as given in the English version, would be correct: "These things"--that is, this practical everyday teaching, which bids Christians distinguish themselves among their fellow-citizens and countrymen in all generous and useful enterprises--in all good things, whether public or private--these things, says the Apostle, are good and profitable unto men; in sharp contrast to the unpractical and useless points insisted upon in the false teaching, apparently too common in the Cretan Church, and against which Titus is earnestly warned in the next (9th) verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- Faithful is the saying</span> for <span class="accented">this is a faithful saying</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concerning these things</span> for <span class="accented">these things</span>, A.V., <span class="accented">confidently</span> for <span class="accented">constantly</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to the end that</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God</span> for <span class="accented">in God</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">may</span> for <span class="accented">might</span>, A.V.; full stop after <span class="accented">good works</span>, and colon after <span class="accented">men. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Faithful is the saying</span>; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a> (where see note). Here the faithful saying can only be the following maxim: "That they which have believed in God may be careful to maintain good works;" the words, "These things I will that thou affirm confidently," being interpolated to give yet more weight to it. <span class="cmt_word">Concerning these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with respect to the things or truths which are the subject of the faithful saying. <span class="cmt_word">I will that thou affirm confidently</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-7.htm">1 Timothy 1:7</a>. "Never be weary of dwelling on these important truths, and asserting them with authority. For such doctrine is really good and profitable for those whom you are commissioned to teach. But leave alone the foolish and unprofitable controversies." <span class="cmt_word">To the end that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). It is not necessary to give to <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> the meaning "<span class="accented">to</span> the end that," in such a sentence as this (see note on Titus 2:12). After words of <span class="accented">command</span> especially, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, frequently, has simply the force of "that." So here, "lay it down as a rule that they which have believed God must be careful to maintain good works." If the sentence had run on without interruption, it would have been <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>. But the interposition of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, with the idea of commanding obedience, has caused the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Believed God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>). The meaning is not the same as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "to believe in," or "on," but "to believe" (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3, 17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-10.htm">1 John 5:10</a>, where the context shows that it is the act of believing God's promise that is meant). And so here, the <span class="accented">believing</span> refers to the promises implied in the preceding reference to the <span class="accented">hope</span> and the <span class="accented">inheritance.</span> May be careful (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but common in the LXX. and in classical Greek. The word means "to give thought" about a thing, "to be careful" or "anxious" about it. <span class="cmt_word">To maintain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); usually in the sense of "presiding over" or "ruling" (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4, 5, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>). Here, alter the analogy of the classical use, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, to "undertake," to "carry on," or the like, fairly expressed by to "maintain." The idea does not seem to be "to stand at the head of," or "to be foremost in." <span class="cmt_word">Good works</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> practical godliness of all kinds (see ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">These things are good</span>, etc. If the reading of the T.R., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>, is retained, the rendering ought to be, "These <span class="accented">are the things that are</span> really <span class="accented">good and profitable unto men</span>, not foolish questions, etc., they are unprofitable." But the R.T. omits the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>. With regard to the interpretation above given of ver. 8, it must be admitted that it is very doubtful. But the great difficulty of the other way of rendering it, as most commentators do, is that it is impossible to say which part of what precedes is "the faithful saying" alluded to; and that the "care to maintain good works" is not that which naturally springs from it; whereas the reiteration in ver. 8 implies that "good works" is the special subject of "the faithful saying." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-11 When the grace of God towards mankind has been declared, the necessity of good works is pressed. Those who believe in God, must make it their care to maintain good works, to seek opportunities for doing them, being influenced by love and gratitude. Trifling, foolish questions must be avoided, and subtle distinctions and vain inquiries; nor should people be eager after novelties, but love sound doctrine which tends most to edifying. Though we may now think some sins light and little, if the Lord awaken the conscience, we shall feel even the smallest sin heavy upon our souls.</body></html>
