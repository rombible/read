The term "lawyer" might possibly indicate that this friend of Paul's was a Roman jurist, but it is more likely that the law in which he was an expert was that of Moses. Hippolytus numbers him among the seventy disciples, and relates how in after years he was Bishop of Diospolis. He is never mentioned by name in the New Testament, except in this place.<p><span class= "bld">And Apollos.</span>--This famous teacher appears often in the New Testament records, in the Acts and several of the Epistles. A distinguished Alexandrian scholar and a disciple of John the Baptist, he was converted to Christianity by the agency of the devoted Priscilla and Aquila, the tent-makers. He became the friend and intimate associate of St. Paul, and might, had he chosen, have rivalled or even superseded St. Paul in his supreme authority over the churches planted along the Mediterranean sea-board. But Apollos seems resolutely to have declined any such rivalry, and to have lived ever as the loyal and devoted friend of the great Apostle; who, however, always seems to have treated the learned and eloquent Alexandrian as an equal power in the Church of Christ, classing Apollos with St. Peter and himself. Luther's well-known suggestion that Apollos was the unknown writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews--"auctor Epistolae ad Hebros . . . ut ego arbritror Apollo"--the authorship (though not the canonicity) of which has been a disputed point as far back as the days of Origen, in the first half of the third century--has been adopted, though, of course, with much reserve, by many. Attention has been called to the somewhat remarkable fact that the names of these three friends of St. Paul, who were classed among his most faithful adherents in this almost the last Epistle he wrote, were derived from three of the most famous heathen deities--Zenas from Zeus; Artemas from Artemis, the famous tutelary goddess of Ephesus; Apollos from the well-known sun-god.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Set forward</span> for <span class="accented">bring</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Set forward</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); the technical expression both in the New Testament and the LXX., and also in classical Greek, for helping a person forward on their journey by supplying them with money food, letters of recommendation, escort, or whatever else they might require (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-38.htm">Acts 20:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-16.htm">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-6.htm">3 John 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Zenas the lawyer</span>. He is utterly unknown. His name is short for <span class="accented">Zenodorus</span>, but whether he was "a Jewish scribe or Roman legist" can hardly be decided. But his companionship with Apollos, and the frequent application of the term <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in the New Testament to the Jewish scribes and lawyers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-35.htm">Matthew 22:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-45.htm">Luke 11:45, 48, 52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-3.htm">Luke 14:3</a>), makes it most probable that he was a Jewish lawyer. <span class="cmt_word">Apollos</span>; the well-known and eminent Alexandrian Jew, who was instructed in the gospel by Aquila and Priscilla at Ephesus, and became a favorite teacher at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>, and the following chapters, and Acts 16:12). It is a probable conjecture of Lewin's that Apollos was the bearer of this letter, written at Corinth, and was on his way to Alexandria, his native place, taking Crete on the way. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-15 Christianity is not a fruitless profession; and its professors must be filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. They must be doing good, as well as keeping away from evil. Let ours follow some honest labour and employment, to provide for themselves and their families. Christianity obliges all to seek some honest work and calling, and therein to abide with God. The apostle concludes with expressions of kind regard and fervent prayer. Grace be with you all; the love and favour of God, with the fruits and effects thereof, according to need; and the increase and feeling of them more and more in your souls. This is the apostle's wish and prayer, showing his affection to them, and desire for their good, and would be a means of obtaining for them, and bringing down on them, the thing requested. Grace is the chief thing to be wished and prayed for, with respect to ourselves or others; it is all good.</body></html>
