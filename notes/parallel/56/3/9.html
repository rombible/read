The Apostle characterises them as "foolish," because they were of an utterly unpractical nature, and consumed time and powers which were needed for other and better things. The "contentions" were disputes and wranglings which arose out of arguments advanced by different teachers upon the "questions" and "genealogies." The "strivings about the law" were, most probably, arguments suggested by disputed and intricate points connected with the law of Moses. In the Talmud we possess unnumbered instances of all these strange and curious inquiries about which men then gravely disputed and wrangled, but none of which could in any way teach men how to make life more beautiful and loving, more like that fair pattern which St. Paul's Master loved. St. Paul, well versed--thanks to his early and elaborate training--in all this useless, curious lore, once and for all would expel from orthodox Christian teaching everything which seemed to bear upon this favourite Jewish theology--so called. It had, cancer-like, eaten the life out of Judaism; it should not, if he could prevent it, poison in like manner the young life of Christianity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Shun</span> for <span class="accented">avoid</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">questionings</span> for <span class="accented">questions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">strifes</span> for <span class="accented">contentions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">fightings</span> for <span class="accented">strivings</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Shun</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Foolish</span> questionings; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-23.htm">2 Timothy 2:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Genealogies</span>; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>.
