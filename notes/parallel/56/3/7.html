We were in a hopeless and lost state, from which God's love for man saved us by the laver of regeneration and renovation; and this was the end for which He saved us--<span class= "ital">that we should be heirs of</span> <span class= "ital">eternal life.</span> "Being justified," that is, freed from the future punishment and consequences of sin, and received into the favour and friendship of God, which favour and friendship had been, through sin, forfeited. "By His grace," by the favour and kindness of God the Father are we restored to His love and friendship. "Heirs," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>, where this thought of our heirship of heaven is enlarged. "According to the hope of eternal life;" this life eternal is still for us in the future, though ever present in respect of hope; children of God we indeed are, and sharers in many a good gift of our Father, but eternal life, <span class= "ital">that</span> glorious inheritance, is still in the far future, and as yet can only be enjoyed by us in hope, but it is a sure hope--eternal life--the hope of which is the mainspring of all Christian work and activity--though it includes it, of course, is something far more than merely endless existence. A veil, impenetrable to mortal eye, hangs between us and the many mansions of the Father's house. "It doth not yet appear what we shall be;" we only know that then, we, in company with an innumerable host of blessed beings, shall share in the beatific vision; we only know that then "we shall ever be with the Lord;" and that with this thought and with these words are we to comfort one another. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1Thessalonians 4:17-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- Might</span> for <span class="accented">should</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Being justified by his grace</span>; showing very clearly that righteousness in man did not precede and cause the saving mercy of God, but that mercy went before and provided the justification which is altogether of grace, and which issues in the possession of eternal life. <span class="cmt_word">Heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span> This seems to be the right rendering rather than that in the margin, <span class="accented">heirs, according to hope, of eternal life</span>, making "<span class="accented">eternal</span> life" depend upon "heirs." The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>, "<span class="accented">In</span> hope of eternal life," is a very strong reason for taking the same construction here. The answer in the Church Catechism, "<span class="accented">Wherein</span> I was made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an <span class="accented">inheritor</span> of the kingdom of heaven," follows very closely St. Paul's teaching in the text (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29, 4</a>:7). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 Spiritual privileges do not make void or weaken, but confirm civil duties. Mere good words and good meanings are not enough without good works. They were not to be quarrelsome, but to show meekness on all occasions, not toward friends only, but to all men, though with wisdom, Jas 3:13. And let this text teach us how wrong it is for a Christian to be churlish to the worst, weakest, and most abject. The servants of sin have many masters, their lusts hurry them different ways; pride commands one thing, covetousness another. Thus they are hateful, deserving to be hated. It is the misery of sinners, that they hate one another; and it is the duty and happiness of saints to love one another. And we are delivered out of our miserable condition, only by the mercy and free grace of God, the merit and sufferings of Christ, and the working of his Spirit. God the Father is God our Saviour. He is the fountain from which the Holy Spirit flows, to teach, regenerate, and save his fallen creatures; and this blessing comes to mankind through Christ. The spring and rise of it, is the kindness and love of God to man. Love and grace have, through the Spirit, great power to change and turn the heart to God. Works must be in the saved, but are not among the causes of their salvation. A new principle of grace and holiness is wrought, which sways, and governs, and makes the man a new creature. Most pretend they would have heaven at last, yet they care not for holiness now; they would have the end without the beginning. Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called therefore the washing of regeneration. The work is inward and spiritual; this is outwardly signified and sealed in this ordinance. Slight not this outward sign and seal; yet rest not in the outward washing, but look to the answer of a good conscience, without which the outward washing will avail nothing. The worker therein is the Spirit of God; it is the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Through him we mortify sin, perform duty, walk in God's ways; all the working of the Divine life in us, and the fruits of righteousness without, are through this blessed and holy Spirit. The Spirit and his saving gifts and graces, come through Christ, as a Saviour, whose undertaking and work are to bring to grace and glory. Justification, in the gospel sense, is the free forgiveness of a sinner; accepting him as righteous through the righteousness of Christ received by faith. God, in justifying a sinner in the way of the gospel, is gracious to him, yet just to himself and his law. As forgiveness is through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction is made to justice by Christ, it cannot be merited by the sinner himself. Eternal life is set before us in the promise; the Spirit works faith in us, and hope of that life; faith and hope bring it near, and fill with joy in expectation of it.</body></html>
