Not improbably one of these two was intended to supply the place of Titus when this favourite and trusted assistant of St. Paul was recalled to his master's side. Of Artemas nothing certainly is known. Tradition, however, makes him subsequently Bishop of Lystra. Tychicus is mentioned in five of the New Testament writings--in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm" title="And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.">2Timothy 4:12</a>; and here. He seems to have been one of the most esteemed of St. Paul's friends. He speaks of him as a beloved brother, a faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord; and the importance of the missions with which he was entrusted by his master to distant churches shows us how high this disciple stood in the opinion of St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">To Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</span>--There are several cities bearing this name--in Cilicia, in Thrace, and in Epirus; and considerable doubt prevails as to which the Apostle has been referring. On the whole, the Nicopolis in Epirus seems the most likely spot for the Apostle to have fixed on. This city was built by Augustus after the battle of Actium, whence it derived its name, "the City of Victory."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Give diligence</span> for <span class="accented">be diligent</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">there I have determined</span> for <span class="accented">I have determined there</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When I shall send Artemas</span>, etc. The action of St. Paul in sending Artemas or Tychicus to take the place of Titus in Crete is exactly the same as he pursued with regard to Ephesus, whither he sent Tychicus to take Timothy's place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11, 12</a>). He would not leave the presbyters in either place without the direction and superintendence of one having his delegated apostolic authority. This led to the final placing of a resident bishop in the Churches, such as we find in the second century. We may conclude that Artemas (otherwise unknown) was the person eventually sent to Crete, as <span class="cmt_word">Tychicus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>) we know went to Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>). We have also an important note of time in this expression, showing clearly that this Epistle was written before the Second Epistle to Timothy (as it probably also was before 1 Timothy) - an inference abundantly corroborated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>, by which it appears that Titus had then actually joined St. Paul, either at Nicopolis or elsewhere, and had started off again to Dalmatia. <span class="cmt_word">Give diligence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>, note; 2 Timothy 4:9, 21. <span class="cmt_word">Nicopolis</span>, in Epirus. The most obvious reason for St. Paul's wintering at Nicopolis is that it was near Apollonia, the harbor opposite Brindisium, which would be his way to Rome, and also well situated for the missionary work in Dalmatia, which we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a> was in hand. Nicopolis (the city of victory) was built by Augustus Caesar to commemorate the great naval victory at Actium over Antony. It is now a complete ruin, uninhabited except by a few shepherds, but with vast remains of broken columns, baths, theatres, etc. (Lewin, vol. 2. p. 253). <span class="cmt_word">To winter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-11.htm">Acts 28:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>. (On the question whether the winter here referred to is the same winter as that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-21.htm">2 Timothy 4:21</a>, see Introduction.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-15 Christianity is not a fruitless profession; and its professors must be filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. They must be doing good, as well as keeping away from evil. Let ours follow some honest labour and employment, to provide for themselves and their families. Christianity obliges all to seek some honest work and calling, and therein to abide with God. The apostle concludes with expressions of kind regard and fervent prayer. Grace be with you all; the love and favour of God, with the fruits and effects thereof, according to need; and the increase and feeling of them more and more in your souls. This is the apostle's wish and prayer, showing his affection to them, and desire for their good, and would be a means of obtaining for them, and bringing down on them, the thing requested. Grace is the chief thing to be wished and prayed for, with respect to ourselves or others; it is all good.</body></html>
