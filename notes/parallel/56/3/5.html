Sad experience, more forcibly than any theological assertion, has demonstrated to us all the utter impossibility of any of us, even the holiest, ever, even for one day, doing the works of a purely righteous man.<p><span class= "bld">But according to his mercy.</span>--As there was nothing in us which called for such a salvation, as there were no acts of ours which deserved reward, His gift of salvation, which includes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm" title="That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.">Titus 3:7</a>) eternal life, was owing entirely to His divine love which saw and pitied our misery, our endless suffering. Out of this hopeless state the eternal pity lifted us, and put us into a state of salvation. The next clause specifies the outward and visible sign of the salvation our loving God was pleased to ordain in His Church, namely, "baptism;" but here great care must be taken properly to understand what St. Paul meant by this baptism, to which he attributed so great power. In St. Paul's mind it was no mere observance, but was a sacrament, in which all that was inward properly and completely accompanied all that was outward. In another place the Apostle has grandly paraphrased his words here. In the Galatian Letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>) he writes how "that as many as were baptised into Christ have put on Christ," that is, have entered into vital union with Him--a blessed state, which most surely leads to life eternal, if the baptised only remain faithful.<p><span class= "bld">By the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</span>--Seeing, then, that God <span class= "ital">has</span> saved us by His own act, independently of any work of ours, we ask, How has He effected this? The words we are here considering give the answer to the question. The Greek should be rendered, "by the laver of regeneration," &c. Then, by means of the laver of regeneration, &c, has God put us into a state of salvation. In other words, He has effected this by means of "baptism" (for the laver here can only signify the baptismal font, and is called the laver of regeneration because it is the vessel consecrated to the use of that sacrament), whereby, in its completeness as a sacrament, the new life in Christ is conveyed. Baptism, then, is the means through which we receive the saving grace of Christ; in its laver we are born again to a new life, in it we receive strength through the Holy Ghost constantly to renew and to develop this new life, <span class= "ital">for it is not only the laver of regeneration but also of renovation by the Holy Spirit.</span> But baptism is here understood in all its completion--the outward visible sign accompanied with the inward spiritual grace. In the case of one who is come to years of understanding seeking baptism, repentance and faith in the promises of God are absolutely required. In the case of infants, who have also from the very earliest times been, through this same laver, enrolled in the communion of Christians, the same profession is required, only they make it by their sureties, and directly that they have come to years of discretion they solemnly and publicly assent to what had been already affirmed in their name. Thus, by means of the laver of regeneration, &c, or, in other words, by baptism <span class= "ital">in all its completion</span>--the outward act being accompanied with the inward faith--He saved us, that is, put us into a state of salvation. Of the difference between "regeneration" and "renovation," the first, "regeneration," is well explained in the words of the collect for Christmas Day, which speaks of the "regenerated" as "made God's children by adoption and grace." The second, "renovation," the same collect goes on to speak of, when it prays that "the regenerated" "may daily be renewed by the Holy Spirit." The first, "regeneration," is spoken of by St. John in his words, "Ye must be born again" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-7.htm" title="Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again.">John 3:7</a>); the second is alluded to by St. Paul when he wrote, "the inward man is renewed day by day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Done in</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">did ourselves</span> for <span class="accented">hare done</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">By works</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e. in consequence of.</span> God's kindness and love to man did not spring from man's good work as the preceding and producing conditions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>, and the notes of Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot).

All this, as the cause of our <span class="accented">salvation</span>, the apostle emphatically denies. -Not, etc., <span class="cmt_word">but according to his mercy he saved us</span>. The predisposing cause, the rule and measure of our salvation, was God's mercy and grace, originating and completing that salvation. <span class="cmt_word">Through the washing of regeneration</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Here we have the means <span class="accented">through</span> or <span class="accented">by</span> which God's mercy saves us. The <span class="accented">washing</span> or rather <span class="accented">laver</span> of regeneration (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> found elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>, in exactly the same connection - is the <span class="accented">laver</span> or <span class="accented">bath</span> in which the washing takes place. The nature or quality of this bath is described by the words, "of regeneration" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>, where it seems rather to mean the great restoration of humanity at the second advent. The word is used by Cicero of his restoration to political power, by Josephus of the restoration of the Jews under Zerubbabel, and by several Greek authors; and the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a> have the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, but in what sense is not quite clear, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, therefore, very fifty describes the new birth in holy baptism, when the believer is put into possession of a new spiritual life, a new nature, and a new inheritance of glory. And the laver of baptism is called "the laver of regeneration," because it is the ordained means by or through which regeneration is obtained. <span class="cmt_word">And renewing of the Holy Ghost<span class="accented">.</span></span> It is doubtful whether the genitive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> depends upon <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> or upon <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Bengel, followed by Alford, takes the former, "per lavacrum et renovationem;" the Vulgate (<span class="accented">lavacrum regenerationis et renova-tionis Spiritus Sancti</span>), the latter, followed by Huther, Bishop Ellicott, and others. It is difficult to hit upon any conclusive argument for one side or the other. But it is against the latter construction that it gives such a very long rambling sentence dependent upon <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. "The <span class="accented">laver</span> of regeneration and of the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior." And it is in favor of the former that the "laver of regeneration" and "the renewing of the Holy Ghost" seem to describe very clearly the two parts of the sacrament, the outward visible sign and the inward spiritual grace; the birth of water and of the Holy Ghost. So that Bengel's rendering seems on the whole to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">Renewing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, and not at all in the LXX. or in classical Greek. But the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>.

This renewal is the work of the Holy Ghost in the new birth, when men are "born again" of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>). Alford is wrong in denying its application here to the first gift of the new life. It is evidently parallel with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The connection of baptism with the effusion of the Holy Spirit is fully set forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. (see especially ver. 38; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16, 17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 Spiritual privileges do not make void or weaken, but confirm civil duties. Mere good words and good meanings are not enough without good works. They were not to be quarrelsome, but to show meekness on all occasions, not toward friends only, but to all men, though with wisdom, Jas 3:13. And let this text teach us how wrong it is for a Christian to be churlish to the worst, weakest, and most abject. The servants of sin have many masters, their lusts hurry them different ways; pride commands one thing, covetousness another. Thus they are hateful, deserving to be hated. It is the misery of sinners, that they hate one another; and it is the duty and happiness of saints to love one another. And we are delivered out of our miserable condition, only by the mercy and free grace of God, the merit and sufferings of Christ, and the working of his Spirit. God the Father is God our Saviour. He is the fountain from which the Holy Spirit flows, to teach, regenerate, and save his fallen creatures; and this blessing comes to mankind through Christ. The spring and rise of it, is the kindness and love of God to man. Love and grace have, through the Spirit, great power to change and turn the heart to God. Works must be in the saved, but are not among the causes of their salvation. A new principle of grace and holiness is wrought, which sways, and governs, and makes the man a new creature. Most pretend they would have heaven at last, yet they care not for holiness now; they would have the end without the beginning. Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called therefore the washing of regeneration. The work is inward and spiritual; this is outwardly signified and sealed in this ordinance. Slight not this outward sign and seal; yet rest not in the outward washing, but look to the answer of a good conscience, without which the outward washing will avail nothing. The worker therein is the Spirit of God; it is the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Through him we mortify sin, perform duty, walk in God's ways; all the working of the Divine life in us, and the fruits of righteousness without, are through this blessed and holy Spirit. The Spirit and his saving gifts and graces, come through Christ, as a Saviour, whose undertaking and work are to bring to grace and glory. Justification, in the gospel sense, is the free forgiveness of a sinner; accepting him as righteous through the righteousness of Christ received by faith. God, in justifying a sinner in the way of the gospel, is gracious to him, yet just to himself and his law. As forgiveness is through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction is made to justice by Christ, it cannot be merited by the sinner himself. Eternal life is set before us in the promise; the Spirit works faith in us, and hope of that life; faith and hope bring it near, and fill with joy in expectation of it.</body></html>
