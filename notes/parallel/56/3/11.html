His perverse conduct in stirring up party-feeling in the Church publicly convicts him of doing the very wrong which in general he professes to condemn. With these words the public or official portion of the Letter to the presiding presbyter in Crete closes. Paul had begun with directions how the church life of the island--up to this period apparently devoid of organisation--was to be arranged; he concludes with instructions how to deal with any who presumed to set themselves in opposition to his plans for the government of the community. The central portion of the letter is occupied in discussing how Christian doctrine is to influence the lives of those accepting it, and especially it treats of the conduct of Christians towards the Pagan world, with whom they will necessarily be brought in contact.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Such a one</span> for <span class="accented">be that is such</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">perverted</span> for <span class="accented">subverted</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">self-condemned</span> for <span class="accented">condemned of himself</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Is perverted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but common in the LXX., and found in classical Greek in a material sense, "to turn inside out," "to root up," and the like. Here it means the complete pervert-ion of the man's Christian character, so as to leave no hope of his amendment. But this is not to be presumed till a first and second admonition have been given in vain. <span class="cmt_word">Self-condemned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, not found in the LXX. nor in classical Greek. It means what Cicero (quoted by Schleusner) says of C. Fabricius, that he was <span class="accented">suo judicio condemnatus</span>, condemned by his own judgment, which, he says, is a heavier condemnation than even that of the law and of the judges ('Pro Cluentio,' 21, at the end). Fabricius was self-condemned because he had left the court in confusion at a critical part of his trial. So the heretics were self-condemned by the very fact that they continued to head the schism after repeated admonitions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-11 When the grace of God towards mankind has been declared, the necessity of good works is pressed. Those who believe in God, must make it their care to maintain good works, to seek opportunities for doing them, being influenced by love and gratitude. Trifling, foolish questions must be avoided, and subtle distinctions and vain inquiries; nor should people be eager after novelties, but love sound doctrine which tends most to edifying. Though we may now think some sins light and little, if the Lord awaken the conscience, we shall feel even the smallest sin heavy upon our souls.</body></html>
