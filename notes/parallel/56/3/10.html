The term "heresies" occurs twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.">1Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>). In neither, however, of these passages does the word signify there a fundamental or doctrinal error. This sense belongs to a usage of later times. From the meaning of the word "heresy" in these passages of St. Paul, we are able to deduce the signification of the term "heretic" here. The "heretic" of the Church in Crete appears to have been a man who, dissatisfied with the organisation and discipline introduced by Titus into the Christian community--not improbably considering himself in some way slighted--withdrew himself from the common body, and gathering round him other discontented spirits, established what might be termed a rival Church in Crete. Although at first, perhaps, no marked erroneous teaching forms part of the practice of such schismatics, still the tendency in such small rival communities is ever more and more to distinguish between <span class= "ital">their</span> teaching and that of the larger body from whom they, in the first instance, cut themselves adrift.<p><span class= "bld">After the first and second admonition reject.</span>--The Greek word rendered "reject" would be more accurately translated <span class= "ital">shun, </span>or <span class= "ital">avoid.</span> There was, no doubt, some self-willed factious party leader in Crete well known to St. Paul to whom he referred here; but partly out of a loving hope that Titus would win him to his side, partly from the knowledge that this Letter was a public instruction to many a Church besides that of Crete, the disturber remained nameless. He was <span class= "ital">to</span> be exhorted once, twice, and then if he remained contumacious he was to be left simply alone to his own devices. The community over which Titus presided in the place of Paul no longer were to know the obstinate heretic as a brother.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- Heretical</span> for <span class="accented">an heretick</span>, A.V.; a for <span class="accented">the</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">refuse</span> for <span class="accented">reject</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Heretical</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, not found in the LXX., but used in classical Greek for "<span class="accented">intelligent</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> able to choose. The use of it here by St. Paul is drawn from the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> for "a sect" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), or the doctrines taught by a sect. The <span class="accented">heretic</span> is one who forsakes the truth held by the Church, and <span class="accented">chooses</span> some doctrine of his own devising (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). The tendency of such departures from the doctrine of the Church to assume more and more of a deadly character, and to depart wider and wider from the truth, gave to the name of heretic a darker shade of condemnation in the mouth of Church writers as time advanced. But even in apostolic times some denied the resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>); others denied the Lord that bought them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>); and there were some who were of the synagogue of Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>); so that already an heretical man, drawing away disciples after him, was a great blot in the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Admonition</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">After a first and second admonition refuse</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm">1 Timothy 5:11</a>. It does not clearly appear what is intended by this term In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm">1 Timothy 5:11</a> it meant refusing admission into the college of Church widows. If these had been persons seeking admission into the Church, or ordination, it would mean "refuse them." Vitringa (Huther) thinks it means "excommunication." Beza, Ellicott, Huther, Alford, etc., render it "shun," "let alone," "cease to admonish," and the like. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-11 When the grace of God towards mankind has been declared, the necessity of good works is pressed. Those who believe in God, must make it their care to maintain good works, to seek opportunities for doing them, being influenced by love and gratitude. Trifling, foolish questions must be avoided, and subtle distinctions and vain inquiries; nor should people be eager after novelties, but love sound doctrine which tends most to edifying. Though we may now think some sins light and little, if the Lord awaken the conscience, we shall feel even the smallest sin heavy upon our souls.</body></html>
