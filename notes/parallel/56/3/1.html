But, with the exception of a slight digression in the case of a slave to a Pagan master, his words had been written with a reference generally to Christian life among <span class= "ital">Christians.</span> But there was then a great life outside the little Christian world; how were the people of Christ to regulate their behaviour in their dealings with the vast Pagan world outside? St. Paul goes to the root of the matter at once when he says, "Put them in mind," &c. Very needful in Crete was such a reminder respecting obedience. The island had, when St. Paul wrote to Titus, been some century and a quarter under Roman rule. Their previous government had been democratic; and historians, like Polybius, who have written of Crete, have dwelt particularly on the turbulent and factious spirit which animated their people; added to which, the many Jews who we know formed a very large part of the Christian Church there, always impatient of a foreign yoke, would in such an atmosphere of excitement be especially eager to assert their right to be free from the hated rule of Rome.<p>The Greek words translated "principalities and powers" are better rendered here by "rulers and authorities," as the word "principalities" is used occasionally in the English version for an "order of angels." The terms include all constituted governors and officials, Roman and otherwise, in the island.<p><span class= "bld">To obey magistrates.</span>--Taken absolutely, <span class= "ital">to obey the temporal power.</span> Our Lord's words were the model for all teaching in this division of Christian ethics One great teacher after the other, in the same spirit, in varied language, urges upon the people of Christ a reverence and submission to all legally constituted authority in the state. This devoted Christian loyalty, no bitter opposition in after years to their tenets could chill, no cruel persecution of individuals lessen. Augustine, writes Professor Reynolds, could boast that when Julian asked Christians to sacrifice and offer incense to the gods they, at all hazards, sternly refused; but when he summoned them to fight for the empire they rushed to the front. "They distinguished between their Eternal Lord and their earthly ruler, and yet they yielded obedience to their earthly ruler for the sake of their Eternal Lord." Least of any should we expect St. Paul to write such words, so loyal and faithful to Rome. He had found, indeed, little cause in his chequered, troubled life to be grateful personally to the Empire; with ears too ready had Rome ever listened to the cruel "informations" laid against him by his implacable Jewish enemies; she had imprisoned him, fettered him, hindered his work, and threatened his life; and when he was writing these deathless words of his, urging upon his devoted flock a loyalty changeless and true, for him the supreme vengeance of Rome was close at hand.<p><span class= "bld">To be ready to every good work.</span>--Ready cheerfully to aid all lawful authority, municipal and otherwise, in their public works undertaken for city or state. The flock of Titus must remember that the true Christian ought to be known as a good citizen and a devoted patriot.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - In <span class="accented">subjection</span> for <span class="accented">subject</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">rulers</span> for <span class="accented">principalities.</span> A.V.; <span class="accented">to authorities</span> for <span class="accented">and powers</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">to be obedient</span> for <span class="accented">to obey magistrates</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Put them in mind</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To rulers, to authorities.</span> Many uncials, which the R.T. follows, omit the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, but it seems necessary to the sense. The change from "principalities and powers" to" rulers" and "authorities" does not seem desirable. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is a favorite juxtaposition el' St. Paul's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10, 15</a>). It occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>. In all the above examples the words, it is true, apply to the angelic hosts, but the words are elsewhere applied separately to human government, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20</a>, they are applied together to the authority of the Roman governor. <span class="cmt_word">To be obedient</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm">Acts 27:21</a>. It follows here its classical use, "to obey a superior," well expressed in the Authorized Version "to obey magistrates." The simple "<span class="accented">to</span> be obedient" of the Revised Version does not express the sense. <span class="cmt_word">To be ready unto every good work.</span> St. Paul is still speaking with especial reference to magistrates and the civil power. Christians were to show themselves good citizens, always ready for any duty to which they were called. Christianity was not to be an excuse for shirking duties, or refusing obedience where it was due. The only limit is expressed by the word "good." They were to give tribute to whom tribute was due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor; but, if ordered to do evil, then they must resist, and obey God rather than man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>). (See the similar limitation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm">Titus 2:10</a>, note, and compare, for the whole verse, the very similar passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 Spiritual privileges do not make void or weaken, but confirm civil duties. Mere good words and good meanings are not enough without good works. They were not to be quarrelsome, but to show meekness on all occasions, not toward friends only, but to all men, though with wisdom, Jas 3:13. And let this text teach us how wrong it is for a Christian to be churlish to the worst, weakest, and most abject. The servants of sin have many masters, their lusts hurry them different ways; pride commands one thing, covetousness another. Thus they are hateful, deserving to be hated. It is the misery of sinners, that they hate one another; and it is the duty and happiness of saints to love one another. And we are delivered out of our miserable condition, only by the mercy and free grace of God, the merit and sufferings of Christ, and the working of his Spirit. God the Father is God our Saviour. He is the fountain from which the Holy Spirit flows, to teach, regenerate, and save his fallen creatures; and this blessing comes to mankind through Christ. The spring and rise of it, is the kindness and love of God to man. Love and grace have, through the Spirit, great power to change and turn the heart to God. Works must be in the saved, but are not among the causes of their salvation. A new principle of grace and holiness is wrought, which sways, and governs, and makes the man a new creature. Most pretend they would have heaven at last, yet they care not for holiness now; they would have the end without the beginning. Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called therefore the washing of regeneration. The work is inward and spiritual; this is outwardly signified and sealed in this ordinance. Slight not this outward sign and seal; yet rest not in the outward washing, but look to the answer of a good conscience, without which the outward washing will avail nothing. The worker therein is the Spirit of God; it is the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Through him we mortify sin, perform duty, walk in God's ways; all the working of the Divine life in us, and the fruits of righteousness without, are through this blessed and holy Spirit. The Spirit and his saving gifts and graces, come through Christ, as a Saviour, whose undertaking and work are to bring to grace and glory. Justification, in the gospel sense, is the free forgiveness of a sinner; accepting him as righteous through the righteousness of Christ received by faith. God, in justifying a sinner in the way of the gospel, is gracious to him, yet just to himself and his law. As forgiveness is through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction is made to justice by Christ, it cannot be merited by the sinner himself. Eternal life is set before us in the promise; the Spirit works faith in us, and hope of that life; faith and hope bring it near, and fill with joy in expectation of it.</body></html>
