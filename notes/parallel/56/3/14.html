A last reminder to the brethren, whom with a loving thought he calls "ours," constantly to practise good and beneficent works. In the expression "let ours also learn," it would seem as though St. Paul would have Christians <span class= "ital">trained</span> to the wise and thoughtful performance of works of mercy and charity.<p>It was with such injunctions as these that men like St. Paul and St. James laid the foundation storeys of those great Christian works of charity--all undreamed of before the Resurrection morning--but which have been for eighteen centuries in all lands, the glory of the religion of Jesus--one grand result of the Master's presence with us on earth, which even His bitterest enemies admire with a grudging admiration.<p>In the short compass of these Pastoral Epistles, in all only thirteen chapters, we have no less than <span class= "ital">eight</span> special reminders to be earnest and zealous in good works. There was evidently a dread in St. Paul's mind that some of those who <span class= "ital">professed</span> a love of Jesus, and <span class= "ital">said</span> that they longed after the great salvation, would content themselves with a dreamy acquiescence in the great truths, while the life remained unaltered. It is noteworthy that these Epistles, containing so many urgent exhortations <span class= "ital">to work</span> for Christ, were St. Paul's last inspired utterances. The passages in question are <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm" title="They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm" title="In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,">Titus 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-14.htm" title="And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.">Titus 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm" title="But (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.">1Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1Timothy 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-18.htm" title="That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;">1Timothy 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2Timothy 2:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Our <span class="accented">people</span> for <span class="accented">ours</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Our people also.</span> The natural inference is that Titus had some fund at his disposal with which he was to help the travelers, but that St. Paul wished the Cretan Christians to contribute also.

They must be doing good, as well as keeping away from evil. Let ours follow some honest labour and employment, to provide for themselves and their families. Christianity obliges all to seek some honest work and calling, and therein to abide with God. The apostle concludes with expressions of kind regard and fervent prayer. Grace be with you all; the love and favour of God, with the fruits and effects thereof, according to need; and the increase and feeling of them more and more in your souls. This is the apostle's wish and prayer, showing his affection to them, and desire for their good, and would be a means of obtaining for them, and bringing down on them, the thing requested. Grace is the chief thing to be wished and prayed for, with respect to ourselves or others; it is all good.</body></html>
