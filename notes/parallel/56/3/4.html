We of ourselves should never have become changed men, had not the kindness of God and His divine love for men shown itself. We, indeed, have no ground for self-exaltation, no excuse for haughty treatment of others, either in thought or action; for if we now live other and purer lives than they live, our change to better and higher things was owing to no desert or merit of ours, but solely to the mercy and the love of God. The changed life is here solely attributed to the manifestation to man of the kindness and love of God our Saviour. Here God our Saviour, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1Timothy 1:1</a>, and in several other passages in the Pastoral Epistles, must be understood as "God the Father;" the "kindness" differs from the "love towards man." The first signifies generally that divine, measureless, all comprehensive love which we know is the glorious attribute of God. The second expression tells of the special love which the Almighty has for man, and which has been so marvellously shown in the sacrifice and death of the Son of God for us. The two words--the measureless, divine love which embraces all creation, and the special love of God for man--taken together, make up the one idea expressed by the "grace that bringeth salvation," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm" title="For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,">Titus 2:11</a> of this Epistle. In the rare word <span class= "ital">philanthropia, </span>the "love of God toward man," a quiet but very solemn reminder is given to those "Christians" who would have no dealings with their less pure heathen neighbours. The word applied here to God tells them to love men, even the enemies of their holy religion; they are to obey the heathen magistrate, and to think kindly of and to act courteously towards their heathen neighbour, because God has loved men--all men. Here are they to be imitators of the divine pity, copyists of the divine love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- When</span> for <span class="accented">after that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the kindness of God our Savior, and his love toward man</span> for <span class="accented">the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Kindness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), used by St. Paul only in the New Testament, and by him frequently in the sense of "kindness," whether of God (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm">Ephesians 2:7</a>) or of man (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>).

Mere good words and good meanings are not enough without good works. They were not to be quarrelsome, but to show meekness on all occasions, not toward friends only, but to all men, though with wisdom, Jas 3:13. And let this text teach us how wrong it is for a Christian to be churlish to the worst, weakest, and most abject. The servants of sin have many masters, their lusts hurry them different ways; pride commands one thing, covetousness another. Thus they are hateful, deserving to be hated. It is the misery of sinners, that they hate one another; and it is the duty and happiness of saints to love one another. And we are delivered out of our miserable condition, only by the mercy and free grace of God, the merit and sufferings of Christ, and the working of his Spirit. God the Father is God our Saviour. He is the fountain from which the Holy Spirit flows, to teach, regenerate, and save his fallen creatures; and this blessing comes to mankind through Christ. The spring and rise of it, is the kindness and love of God to man. Love and grace have, through the Spirit, great power to change and turn the heart to God. Works must be in the saved, but are not among the causes of their salvation. A new principle of grace and holiness is wrought, which sways, and governs, and makes the man a new creature. Most pretend they would have heaven at last, yet they care not for holiness now; they would have the end without the beginning. Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called therefore the washing of regeneration. The work is inward and spiritual; this is outwardly signified and sealed in this ordinance. Slight not this outward sign and seal; yet rest not in the outward washing, but look to the answer of a good conscience, without which the outward washing will avail nothing. The worker therein is the Spirit of God; it is the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Through him we mortify sin, perform duty, walk in God's ways; all the working of the Divine life in us, and the fruits of righteousness without, are through this blessed and holy Spirit. The Spirit and his saving gifts and graces, come through Christ, as a Saviour, whose undertaking and work are to bring to grace and glory. Justification, in the gospel sense, is the free forgiveness of a sinner; accepting him as righteous through the righteousness of Christ received by faith. God, in justifying a sinner in the way of the gospel, is gracious to him, yet just to himself and his law. As forgiveness is through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction is made to justice by Christ, it cannot be merited by the sinner himself. Eternal life is set before us in the promise; the Spirit works faith in us, and hope of that life; faith and hope bring it near, and fill with joy in expectation of it.</body></html>
