The sense of the passage is, however, little changed by the alteration. The meaning is clear, "Domi mansit lanam fecit." Home duties, cares, pleasures, sacrifices of self--these God-appointed duties ought to fill the mind and the heart of the young wife. There should be no desire, no attempt, to go round to the other houses, and so contracting idle, gossiping habits. Hofmann thus sums up these directions to the young Christian women of Crete, "Gute Hausfrauen will der Apostel haben."<p><span class= "bld">Good.</span>--Gracious, kind, thoughtful to others, especially to inferiors.<p><span class= "bld">Obedient to their own husbands.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">submitting themselves to their own husbands.</span> Women who really love their Master Christ should take care that, as far as in them lay, the law of subordination in the family to its rightful head should be strictly carried out. In a Church like that of Crete, made out of divided houses often, where the Christian wife was married to a Pagan husband, such a charge as this was especially needful.<p><span class= "bld">That the word of God be not blasphemed.</span>--These words refer to all the exhortations from <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm" title="That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.">Titus 2:2</a> onwards, but more particularly to those clauses enforcing home duties immediately preceding. There was, of course, the fear that wives, carried away by religious fervour, might neglect the plainer every-day duties for the seemingly loftier and more self-denying occupations included under the head of religious works. Such failure in every-day tasks would, of course, be bitterly charged on the religion of Christ, and the gospel would run the danger of being evil-spoken of, even in other than purely Pagan circles. But the reference extends over a broader area than that occupied by Christian mistresses of households. All, of every rank and age, who think they love the Lord Jesus should remember that the "enemy" is ever watching their words and works; never should they who wear the colours of the great King forget the charge of the King's son, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Sober-minded</span> for <span class="accented">discreet</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">workers</span> for <span class="accented">keepers</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">kind</span> for <span class="accented">good</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">being in subjection</span> for <span class="accented">obedient</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Sober</span>-<span class="cmt_word">minded</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); as in ver. 2 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm">Titus 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>. "Discreet" is nearer the sense than "sober-minded." Perhaps the French <span class="accented">sage</span> is nearer still. <span class="cmt_word">Workers at home</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, for the T.R. <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). Neither word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament or in the <span class="accented">LXX.</span>, nor does <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in classical Greek. But <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which is probably the true reading (Huther), is common in good classical Greek for "stayers at home." It is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a "keeper." Kind (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>). The idea of <span class="accented">kindness</span> or <span class="accented">good nature</span> seems to be the side of goodness here intended; as we say, "He was very good to me" (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). Kindness is the leading idea in <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Obedient</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). These identical words occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a> (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That the Word of God be not blasphemed</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1</a>). St. Paul complains that the Name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles on account of the evil deeds of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20-23</a>). Our Lord, on the other hand, exhorts that Christians, by their good works, should lead men to glorify their Father which is in heaven. The passage before us shows how much the honor of Christianity is bound up with the faithful discharge by Christians of the simple domestic duties of life. In truth, the <span class="accented">family</span> is the chief <span class="accented">seat</span>, and often the main test, of Christian virtue, as it is the distinctive feature of humanity as ordained by God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Old disciples of Christ must behave in every thing agreeably to the Christian doctrine. That the aged men be sober; not thinking that the decays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort from nearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith works by, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need to be on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for every word, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all must be ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many expose themselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want of discretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young men are apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly called upon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pride than by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop the mouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thine uprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth which would fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him to speak of!</body></html>
