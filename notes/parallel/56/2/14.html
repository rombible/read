These words take up the thought expressed in the term "Saviour" of the last verse. "Himself," His whole self, as has been well said, "the greatest gift ever given;" "for us," that is, on our behalf.<p><span class= "bld">That he might redeem us from all iniquity.</span>--That He for us might pay a ransom, the ransom being His precious blood. Our Saviour, by the payment of this tremendous ransom--O deepest and most unfathomable of all mysteries!--released us from everything which is opposed to God's blessed will. Here the mighty ransom is spoken of as freeing us from the bondage of lawlessness; elsewhere in the divine books the same ransom is described as delivering us from the penalties of this same breaking the divine law--"alles was der Ordnung Gottes widerstreitet" (Hofmann, <span class= "ital">Commentary on Titus</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">And purify unto himself a peculiar people.</span>--The expression "a peculiar people" is taken from the LXX. translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, where the words occur several times (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>); the idea is also purely an Old Testament one. Just as Jehovah wished to establish a people which should belong to Him ("peculiarly His," "His very own"), submitting to His laws, in contrast to the rest of mankind, lawless, idolatrous--so Jesus would set apart and purify for Himself a people, which for His sake should devote itself to God, in contrast to the rest of humanity sunk in selfish sins.

The literal meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> is "in defense of," and hence generally "on behalf of," "for the good of." The primary idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is "standing opposite," and hence it denotes "exchange," "price," "worth," "instead," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Redeem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm">Luke 24:21</a>:<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; common in classical Greek. In the middle voice, as here, it means "to release by payment of a ransom;" in the active voice, "to release on receipt of a ransom." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a> the ransom price is stated, viz. "the precious blood of Christ;" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> it is "the life of the Son of man." The effect of this redemption is not merely deliverance from the penalty of sin, but from its power also, as appears by the following words: "a peculiar people, zealous of good works," and by the passage in St. Peter above referred to. <span class="cmt_word">Purify</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>); as very frequently in the New Testament of cleansing lepers, the outside of the platter, etc., cleansing the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>), putting away all sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>), cleansing the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>), purging the conscience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>), etc. The <span class="accented">iniquity</span> just spoken of was a defilement; the <span class="accented">redemption from iniquity</span> removed that defilement. The blood of Jesus Christ, the price paid for the redemption, was the instrument of cleansing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7, 9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A people for his own possession</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but frequent in the LXX., coupled, as here, with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-18.htm">Deuteronomy 26:18</a>), to express the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, a people the <span class="accented">peculiar</span> property, or treasure, of God; "peculiar" being derived from the Latin <span class="accented">peculium</span>, one's own private property, reserved for one's own private use. The Authorized Version "peculiar" expresses the sense exactly, and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of our text and of the LXX., from whom it is borrowed, is meant to define either that special reserved portion of a man's property over and above what he spends for ordinary expenses, which nobody can interfere with, or those jewels on which he sets a special value, and places safely in his treasury. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("a peculiar people," Authorized Version) means the same thing, that being the LXX. translation of the same Hebrew word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a> ("jewels," Authorized Version), "They shall be my reserved portion or possession." The application of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, descriptive in the Old Testament of Israel, to the Church of Christ, is very instructive. The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a> is exactly analogous, as is the phrase, "the Israel of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Zealous</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>. From its special application to those who were zealous for the Law of Moses it became the name of the sect or party of the <span class="accented">Zealots</span> who played such a terrible part in the Jewish war (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-15.htm">Luke 4:15</a>). <span class="accented">Canaanite</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>) is the Hebrew for <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. Zeal for good works is the indispensable mark of God's peculiar people, the inseparable fruit of the redemption and purification which is by the blood of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-15 The doctrine of grace and salvation by the gospel, is for all ranks and conditions of men. It teaches to forsake sin; to have no more to do with it. An earthly, sensual conversation suits not a heavenly calling. It teaches to make conscience of that which is good. We must look to God in Christ, as the object of our hope and worship. A gospel conversation must be a godly conversation. See our duty in a very few words; denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, living soberly, righteously, and godly, notwithstanding all snares, temptations, corrupt examples, ill usage, and what remains of sin in the believer's heart, with all their hinderances. It teaches to look for the glories of another world. At, and in, the glorious appearing of Christ, the blessed hope of Christians will be complete: To bring us to holiness and happiness was the end of Christ's death. Jesus Christ, that great God and our Saviour, who saves not only as God, much less as Man alone; but as God-man, two natures in one person. He loved us, and gave himself for us; and what can we do less than love and give up ourselves to him! Redemption from sin and sanctification of the nature go together, and make a peculiar people unto God, free from guilt and condemnation, and purified by the Holy Spirit. All Scripture is profitable. Here is what will furnish for all parts of duty, and the right discharge of them. Let us inquire whether our whole dependence is placed upon that grace which saves the lost, pardons the guilty, and sanctifies the unclean. And the further we are removed from boasting of fancied good works, or trusting in them, so that we glory in Christ alone, the more zealous shall we be to abound in real good works.</body></html>
