The second and equally weighty mission the Apostle Paul charged him to execute was the refutation of a school of professed Christian teachers, who were promulgating doctrines at variance with the teaching of St. Paul and his brother Apostles, and were also, by their example and lives, fatally lowering the tone of Christian life. It was to the latter point--the evil <span class= "ital">moral</span> influence of these teachers--that the attention of Titus was especially directed. False doctrinal teaching was bringing forth already its sure fruit, in the form of a life utterly unlike the pattern life of the Master. In contrast to this erroneous and misleading teaching, Titus is directed to exhort the varied ages, the different sexes, the bond and the free, to live lives which will bring no dishonour upon their Christian profession. The strictly practical nature of these charges is remarkable. Before touching upon doctrine, he presses home to these various ages and ranks the necessity of a quiet, useful life. The "sound doctrine" by which Titus was bidden to regulate his teaching is an expression peculiar to these Pastoral Epistles (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm" title="For fornicators, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for enslavers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;">1Timothy 1:10</a>), and stands in clear contrast to the sickly, unhealthy teaching, fanciful and false, of the misleading teachers of Crete.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Befit</span> for <span class="accented">become</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the sound</span> for <span class="accented">sound</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">But speak thou</span>, etc. The apostle now brings out, in full couldst with the vain talk of the heretical teachers, the solid, sober teaching of a true man of God, in harmony with the sound doctrine of the gospel of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">The sound doctrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a> (where see note).

The article "the" is not required. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Old disciples of Christ must behave in every thing agreeably to the Christian doctrine. That the aged men be sober; not thinking that the decays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort from nearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith works by, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need to be on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for every word, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all must be ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many expose themselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want of discretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young men are apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly called upon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pride than by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop the mouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thine uprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth which would fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him to speak of!</body></html>
