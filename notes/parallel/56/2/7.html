In everything that was earnest and true, Titus ought to be the one showing an example to the rest; in peaceful, quiet days, as in times of danger and threatening, he must set the pattern--now of useful labour and toil--now of brave, patient endurance for the Lord's sake.<p><span class= "bld">In doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity.</span>--The older authorities omit "sincerity." Neither of the terms "uncorruptness" and "gravity" refers to the subject-matter of the "doctrine" or "teaching," but to the bearing and behaviour of the "teacher." While he occupies the place of a teacher, Titus must show in his life and conversation "uncorruptness"--<span class= "ital">apthoria, </span>the word found in the older authorities, the meaning of which differs very slightly from the word <span class= "ital">adiapthoria, </span>found in the received text. He must, in all those points of his life which are connected with his teaching, show a purity (<span class= "ital">chastity</span>) and freedom from all interested motives; he must be above seeking for popular applause; but besides this "uncorruptness," in everything touching public instruction he must aim at a certain "gravity," not only in his public delivery of sermons and lectures, but also in his general private intercourse with his flock. He must, in a word, never forget he is the chief teacher in the Church of Crete of his Master's religion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - An <span class="accented">ensample</span> for <span class="accented">a pattern</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">thy doctrine</span> for <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, A.V.; R.T. omits <span class="accented">sincerity</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), which is in the T.R. <span class="cmt_word">In all things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); "concerning, in the matter of" (Ellicott on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>). St. Jerome and others connect these words with the preceding clause, "to be sober-minded in all things." But it is usually taken as in the text, "in all things showing thyself," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Showing thyself</span>, etc. With regard to the somewhat unusual addition of the reflexive pronoun to the verb in the middle voice, Bishop Ellicott remarks, "Emphasis and perspicuity are gained" by it. <span class="cmt_word">An ensample</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Huther remarks that this is the only passage in the New Testament where <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is followed by a genitive of the thing. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a> the genitive is of the person to whom the example is given, in word, in conversation, etc., and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-3.htm">1 Peter 5:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Of good works</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>).

The word describes the quality of the <span class="accented">teacher</span> rather than of his doctrine. He is to preach the truth without fear or favor. <span class="cmt_word">Gravity</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm">1 Timothy 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>.

But the construction of the sentence is somewhat irregular for brevity's sake. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Old disciples of Christ must behave in every thing agreeably to the Christian doctrine. That the aged men be sober; not thinking that the decays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort from nearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith works by, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need to be on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for every word, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all must be ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many expose themselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want of discretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young men are apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly called upon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pride than by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop the mouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thine uprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth which would fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him to speak of!</body></html>
