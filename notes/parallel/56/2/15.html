A new division of the Epistle begins immediately after this verse with the third chapter. He is to speak the words--many of them sharp and bitter--told him by St. Paul; he is to remember now to exhort, now to rebuke, and all this "with authority," as chief pastor of the flock of Crete formally commissioned and appointed.<p><span class= "bld">Let no man despise thee.</span>--"Speak," wrote the brave-hearted old man Paul, "speak with decision, and rebuke and punish if need be with vigour, remembering the dark character of the people with whom you have to do." And perhaps in the background of this stirring admonition of the aged master to his disciple, placed in so difficult and responsible a position, there is the anxious warning again: Yes, but show all diligence too in your own words and doings, so that every word of thine may have its full weight, that none may despise thee on account of thine own life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Reprove fur <span class="accented">rebuke</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Authority</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a> and above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-3.htm">Titus 1:3</a>, "authoritative commandment." <span class="cmt_word">Let no man despise thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>); here only in the New Testament; used in a different sense by the LXX. in Wisd. 1:1, but in the same sense as here in 4 Macc. 6:9, and also in classical Greek.

The apostle thus winds up the preceding portion of his Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-15 The doctrine of grace and salvation by the gospel, is for all ranks and conditions of men. It teaches to forsake sin; to have no more to do with it. An earthly, sensual conversation suits not a heavenly calling. It teaches to make conscience of that which is good. We must look to God in Christ, as the object of our hope and worship. A gospel conversation must be a godly conversation. See our duty in a very few words; denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, living soberly, righteously, and godly, notwithstanding all snares, temptations, corrupt examples, ill usage, and what remains of sin in the believer's heart, with all their hinderances. It teaches to look for the glories of another world. At, and in, the glorious appearing of Christ, the blessed hope of Christians will be complete: To bring us to holiness and happiness was the end of Christ's death. Jesus Christ, that great God and our Saviour, who saves not only as God, much less as Man alone; but as God-man, two natures in one person. He loved us, and gave himself for us; and what can we do less than love and give up ourselves to him! Redemption from sin and sanctification of the nature go together, and make a peculiar people unto God, free from guilt and condemnation, and purified by the Holy Spirit. All Scripture is profitable. Here is what will furnish for all parts of duty, and the right discharge of them. Let us inquire whether our whole dependence is placed upon that grace which saves the lost, pardons the guilty, and sanctifies the unclean. And the further we are removed from boasting of fancied good works, or trusting in them, so that we glory in Christ alone, the more zealous shall we be to abound in real good works.</body></html>
