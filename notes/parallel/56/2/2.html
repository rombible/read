In the famous Pauline trilogy of virtues, in this place, "patience" takes the place of hope, because this brave patience, this enduring fortitude, especially becomes the old man waiting for death. In respect to these "three" they must be healthy, sound. The faith must not be adulterated with superstitions--the love must be chivalrous, not sentimental. It must be no partisan feeling, but a tender affection, broad and inclusive, as was St. Paul's and his Master Christ's. The patience must be no mere tame acquiescence in what seems to be the inevitable, but must be brave, enduring, suffering--if suffering comes--for the Lord's sake with a smile on the lips. "Not without reason," writes Calvin, "does St. Paul include in these three the sum of Christian perfections." It is with "faith" that we worship God--no prayer, no work of piety, can be severed from "faith." "Love" spreads its wings over all our duties to our neighbour; and "patience" must ever go hand in hand with both "faith" and "love." Without "patience" could <span class= "ital">"</span>faith" hardly endure; and the affronts and unkindnesses of the world would, without this high virtue of patience, soon deaden and even destroy "love."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Aged</span> for <span class="accented">the aged</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">temperate</span> for <span class="accented">sober</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sober-minded</span> for <span class="accented">temperate</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">love</span> for <span class="accented">charity</span>, A.V.

We must not miss the important warning, not only to have some kind of faith, love, and patience, but to be healthy and vigorous in our faith, love, and patience. There is a puny faith, a sickly love. and a misdirected patience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Old disciples of Christ must behave in every thing agreeably to the Christian doctrine. That the aged men be sober; not thinking that the decays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort from nearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith works by, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need to be on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for every word, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all must be ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many expose themselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want of discretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young men are apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly called upon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pride than by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop the mouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thine uprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth which would fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him to speak of!</body></html>
