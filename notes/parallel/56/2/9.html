With some special reference to the peculiar circumstances of the Church in Crete, St. Paul had been giving general directions to his representative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/2-1.htm" title="But speak you the things which become sound doctrine:">Titus 2:1-8</a>) respecting instruction and advice he considered it expedient should be given to the varied orders and ages of professing Christians in the island. These directions were arranged with respect to "age" and "sex." He now turns to the question of the instruction of another large class, among whom were to be found many Christians--"the slaves." These he masses together under one head. Not improbably these "words" to be addressed particularly to slaves were called out by some particular instances of insubordination and of impatience under their unhappy condition among the Cretan slaves. Indeed, the repeated warnings to this unfortunate and oppressed class (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm" title="Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.">1Timothy 6:1</a>) tell us that among the difficulties which Christianity had to surmount in its early years was the hard task of persuading "the slave" that the divine Master who promised him a home, if he were faithful and true, among the many mansions of His Father, meant not that the existing relations of society should be then changed, or its complex framework disturbed. St. Paul knew it was a hard matter to persuade the bondman, fellow-heir of heaven with the freeman, to acquiesce patiently in his present condition of misery and servitude. Hence these repeated charges to this class. These poor sufferers were to obey cheerfully, readily, as the next clause told them.<p><span class= "bld">And to please them well in all things; not answering again.</span>--The last words are better translated <span class= "ital">not gainsaying; </span>the Vulgate has <span class= "ital">contradicentes.</span> It signifies that they should obey cheerfully, willingly, without sullenness; not thwarting or setting themselves against their masters' plans or desires or orders; and the Apostle, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm" title="Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.">Titus 2:10</a>, gives them a noble inducement for this brave, sweet patience he would have so earnestly pressed upon them. Such conduct on their part, he tells them, would serve greatly to help the Master's cause; it would prepossess many hostile minds in favour of a religion which could so powerfully influence even the slave. Chrysostom comments thus: "Greeks form their estimate of doctrines not from the doctrine itself, but from the actions and the life" (of those who profess the doctrine).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- In subjection to</span> for <span class="accented">obedient unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">be well-pleasing to them</span> for <span class="accented">please them well</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gainsaying</span> for <span class="accented">answering gain</span>, A.V.

Here, however, the" answering again" of the A.V. is a better rendering. It implies, of course, a resistance to the will of their master, and impatience of any rebuke (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18-20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:9,10 Servants must know and do their duty to their earthly masters, with a reference to their heavenly one. In serving an earthly master according to Christ's will, He is served; such shall be rewarded by him. Not giving disrespectful or provoking language; but to take a check or reproof with silence, not making confident or bold replies. When conscious of a fault, to excuse or justify it, doubles it. Never putting to their own use that which is their master's, nor wasting the goods they are trusted with. Showing all good fidelity to improve a master's goods, and promote his thriving. If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? Lu 16:12. True religion is an honour to the professors of it; and they should adorn it in all things.</body></html>
