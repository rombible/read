It may be asked, What <span class= "ital">is</span> this hope? We answer, it is "the hope of glory" which we shall share with the Son of God, when we behold Him as He is. So for us the hope of glory is intimately bound up with the second coming of the Lord. Then the life of the lover of the Lord must be one continued looking for, waiting for, the coming of the Lord in glory--must be a looking for that hour when we shall see in all His divine majesty, Him who redeemed us. In that life and light, in that majesty and glory, His own will share.<p><span class= "bld">Of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</span>--The translation here should run, <span class= "ital">of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span> From the English version, it would seem that Paul's idea was that the Christian should live waiting for the glorious appearing of the great God, accompanied with our Lord Jesus Christ. The rendering we have adopted, on what seems conclusive grounds, speaks of a Christian life, as a life ever looking for the glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.<p>In this sublime passage the glory of the only begotten Son <span class= "ital">alone</span> finds mention. Taken thus, it is a studied declaration of the divinity of the Eternal Son, who is here styled "our great God and Saviour." Reasoning merely on grammatical principles, either translation would be possible, only even then there is a presumption in favour of the translation we have adopted. (See Ellicott's Note on this verse.) But other considerations are by no means so nearly equally balanced. The word "manifestation" (<span class= "ital">epiphany</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the central thought of the sentence, is employed by St. Paul in his Epistles five times, and in every one of them to describe the manifestation of <span class= "ital">Christ, </span>and in four of them to designate the future manifestation of His coming in glory, as here. The term epiphany is <span class= "ital">never</span> applied to the Father.<p>Again, the <span class= "ital">whole of the context</span> of the passage specially relates to the "Son of God." The introduction of the epiphany "of <span class= "ital">the Father"</span> would be a thought not merely strange to the whole New Testament, but would bring quite a new idea into this statement, which sets forth so sublimely the epiphany of <span class= "ital">Christ</span> as the ground of the Christian's hope--an idea, too, no sooner suggested than dropped, for the passage goes on to speak only of the Son. Perhaps, however, the weightiest argument that can be adduced is the consensus of the Greek orthodox fathers, who, with scarcely an exception, concur in the interpretation which understands the expression "of our great God" as used of Jesus Christ. To select two examples out of the long chain of fathers reaching from the apostolic age who have thus understood this text: "St. Paul here calls Christ the great God, and thus rebukes the heretical blasphemy which denies His Godhead" (Theodoret). "What can those persons say," asks Chrysostom, referring to this passage, "who allege that the Son is inferior to the Father?" (See Wordsworth's Note here.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- The</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior</span> for <span class="accented">the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Looking for</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); the word commonly applied to waiting for the kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-36.htm">Luke 12:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-51.htm">Luke 23:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-21.htm">Jude 1:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The blessed hope.</span> The <span class="accented">hope</span> here means the thing hoped for, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a> (where both the subjective hope and the thing hoped for are included); <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-5.htm">Galatians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a> (comp. too <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24, 25</a>). Here the hope is called emphatically "the blessed hope," the hope of Christ's second coming in glory, that hope which is the joy and life, the strength and comfort, of every Christian soul. This is the only place in the New Testament where <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is applied to an object which does not itself enjoy the blessing, but is a source of blessing to others. Of the fifty passages where it occurs it is applied in forty-three to persons, twice to God, three times to parts of the body (the Virgin's womb, and the eyes and ears of those who saw and heard Christ), once impersonally ("It is more blessed to give," etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>), and once, in this passage, to the hope. <span class="cmt_word">And appearing of the glory.</span> In construing this clause, as well as the following, the same difficulty occurs. There is only one article to the two subjects. The question arises - Can two different subjects stand under one article? Huther affirms that they can, and refers for proof to Buttman and Wince; and, indeed, it is impossible to treat "the hope" and the "appearing" as one subject. Accepting this, the clause before us should be rendered, <span class="accented">Looking for the blessed hope, and the appearing of the glory of the great God.</span> This is a description of the second coming of the Lord, of whom it is expressly said that he will "come in the glory of his Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>). The appearing of Christ will be the appearing of the glory of the great God, not the appearing of God the Father, to whom the term <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is never applied, but of the Son, who is the Brightness of his Father's glory. <span class="cmt_word">Our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.</span> No doubt the Greek words can be so rendered, and perhaps (grammatically) most naturally, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm">2 Peter 1:11</a>, where we read, "The kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ;" and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>. But, on the other hand, according to what is said above, they need not be so rendered. "The great God" and "our Savior Jesus Christ" may be two separate subjects, as "the blessed hope" and "appearing of the glory" are. Anti we have to inquire, from the usual language of Scripture, which of the two is most probable. Alford, in a long note, shows that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> is often used without the article (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>); that in analogous sentences: where <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used as our Lord's title, an exactly similar construction to that in the text is employed, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-2.htm">2 Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-3.htm">Galatians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-23.htm">Ephesians 6:23</a>, etc. He also observes, after Wince, that the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is an additional reason for the omission of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>, and elsewhere; and that the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> makes it still more difficult to connect <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; and lastly, he compares this passage with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-3.htm">1 Timothy 2:3, 5, 6</a>, and thinks the conclusion inevitable that the apostle, writing two sentences so closely corresponding - written, it may be added, so near to one another in time - would have had in view, in both passages, the same distinction of persons which is so strongly marked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3, 5</a>. On these grounds he pronounces against the rendering which is adopted by the Revised Version. Huther's conclusion is the same: partly from the grammatical possibility of <span class="accented">two</span> subjects (here <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) having only one article, which leaves the question of whether there are here one or <span class="accented">two</span> subjects to be decided on other grounds than simple grammar; and partly and chiefly from the double consideration that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">nowhere</span> in Scripture is <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> connected directly with <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> so often are; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the collocation of God (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) and Christ as two subjects is of constant occurrence, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>; to which may probably be added <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>; he decides, surely rightly, that the clause should be rendered, <span class="accented">the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ.</span> Another question arises whether <span class="cmt_word">the glory</span> belongs to both subjects. Probably, though not necessarily, it does, since we are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-27.htm">Matthew 17:27</a> that "the Son of man shall come in the glory of the Father;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, "the Son of man shall come in his glory" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). The whole sentence will then stand thus: <span class="accented">Looking for the blessed hope, and for the appearing of the glory of the great God and of our Savior Jesus Christ</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The great God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); not elsewhere in the New Testament (except in the T.R. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a>), but familiar to us from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3</a>, "The Lord is a great God," and elsewhere, KS <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-21.htm">Deuteronomy 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>, etc. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-35.htm">Matthew 5:35</a>' we read "the great King" of God. This grand description of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the world to come," is in contrast with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, "this present world," in which our present life is passed, but which is so deeply influenced by "the blessed hope" of that future and glorious world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-15 The doctrine of grace and salvation by the gospel, is for all ranks and conditions of men. It teaches to forsake sin; to have no more to do with it. An earthly, sensual conversation suits not a heavenly calling. It teaches to make conscience of that which is good. We must look to God in Christ, as the object of our hope and worship. A gospel conversation must be a godly conversation. See our duty in a very few words; denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, living soberly, righteously, and godly, notwithstanding all snares, temptations, corrupt examples, ill usage, and what remains of sin in the believer's heart, with all their hinderances. It teaches to look for the glories of another world. At, and in, the glorious appearing of Christ, the blessed hope of Christians will be complete: To bring us to holiness and happiness was the end of Christ's death. Jesus Christ, that great God and our Saviour, who saves not only as God, much less as Man alone; but as God-man, two natures in one person. He loved us, and gave himself for us; and what can we do less than love and give up ourselves to him! Redemption from sin and sanctification of the nature go together, and make a peculiar people unto God, free from guilt and condemnation, and purified by the Holy Spirit. All Scripture is profitable. Here is what will furnish for all parts of duty, and the right discharge of them. Let us inquire whether our whole dependence is placed upon that grace which saves the lost, pardons the guilty, and sanctifies the unclean. And the further we are removed from boasting of fancied good works, or trusting in them, so that we glory in Christ alone, the more zealous shall we be to abound in real good works.</body></html>
