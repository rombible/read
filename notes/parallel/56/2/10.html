Others received an elaborate training, and as artists, or even physicians, worked in part for their masters. A slave in the days of St. Paul had a hundred ways of showing to his owner this true and genuine fidelity, opposed to mere assumed surface obedience and service.<p><span class= "bld">That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</span>--A slave cheerfully accepting his hard yoke, and striving with hand and brain to please and advance the interest of his earthly master only for the dear love of Christ, must have been in those days of cynical <span class= "ital">self-love</span> a silent, yet a most powerful preacher of a gospel which could so mould and elevate a character so degraded. Calvin remarks that it is indeed noteworthy how God deigns to receive an adornment from slaves, whose condition was so mean and abject that scarcely were they considered to rank among men at all; "they were ranked as 'possessions.' just like cattle or horses." Professor Reynolds very happily remarks here: "This teaching of St. Paul is in harmony with the words of the Lord Jesus--out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou perfected praise. God gets His highest praise from the lips of little children, His robes of glory from the faithfulness, honour, and simplicity of born slaves."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Purloining</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">separating</span> for their own use what does not belong to them. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-2.htm">Acts 5:2, 3</a>, "<span class="accented">to</span> keep back part." It is used in the same sense by the LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a> of Achan, and 2 Macc. 4:32 of Menelaus, and occasionally in classical Greek (Xenophon, Polybius, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Showing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>). It occurs eleven times in the New Testament, viz. twice in Hebrews, and nine times in St. Paul's acknowledged Epistles. <span class="cmt_word">All good fidelity</span>. All fidelity means fidelity in everything where fidelity is required in a faithful servant - care of his master's property, conscientious labor, keeping of time, acting behind his master's back the same as before his face. The singular addition <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, coming after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, must mean, as Bengel says, "in all good things." The duty of <span class="accented">fidelity</span> does not extend to crime or wrong-doing. The word "good" is like the addition in the oath of canonical obedience, "in all honest things," and is a necessary limitation to the preceding "all" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>, and note). <span class="cmt_word">The doctrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) as in ver. 1 (where see note). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9</a> (where see note) <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is used in the same way. This use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is confirmed by the reading of the R.T., which inserts a second <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Adorn the doctrine.</span> The sentiment is the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>.

In serving an earthly master according to Christ's will, He is served; such shall be rewarded by him. Not giving disrespectful or provoking language; but to take a check or reproof with silence, not making confident or bold replies. When conscious of a fault, to excuse or justify it, doubles it. Never putting to their own use that which is their master's, nor wasting the goods they are trusted with. Showing all good fidelity to improve a master's goods, and promote his thriving. If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? Lu 16:12. True religion is an honour to the professors of it; and they should adorn it in all things.</body></html>
