They now--the women--must remember that the position which Christ and His disciples had claimed for them in the world was not without its grave responsibilities. These aged women of the flock. like the elders just exhorted, had also much to do for Christ.<p><span class= "bld">That they be in behaviour as becometh holiness.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">that they should show themselves as it becometh holiness; </span>or, more literally, <span class= "ital">in demeanour</span> <span class= "ital">reverend.</span> The Greek word rendered "in behaviour," or "in demeanour," includes dress, appearance, conversation, manner; includes an outward deportment dependent on something more internal. The elder Christian woman in her whole bearing should exhibit a certain dignity of sacred demeanour; there should be something in her general appearance, in her dress, in her speech, in her every-day behaviour, which the younger and more thoughtless sister could respect and reverence--an ideal she might hope one day, if the Master spared her so long, herself to reach. For an admirable gloss on these words, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9-10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Not false accusers.</span>--Or better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">not slanderers.</span> St. Paul knew well how easily old age yields itself to this temptation. Old age is at times intolerant, censorious, even bitter, forgetful especially of the days of youth; but Christ's aged saints must use their voice for better things than these.<p><span class= "bld">Not given to much wine.</span>--This warning was probably called for, owing to the evil habits and customs of the Cretans.<p><span class= "bld">Teachers of good things.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">teachers of what is good.</span> Beza's rendering, "mistresses of honour" (<span class= "ital">honestatis magistr?</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>is singular and expressive. This does not mean that these aged women should occupy the place of public instructresses, but that they should, by here and there speaking a kind warning word, and, better still, by the golden silence of a useful honoured life, teach their younger sisters lessons of truth and faith and love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- That</span> for <span class="accented">the</span>, A.V; <span class="accented">be reverent in demeanor</span> for <span class="accented">that they be in behavior as becometh holiness</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">slanderers</span> for <span class="accented">false accusers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">nor</span> for <span class="accented">not</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">enslaved</span> for <span class="accented">given</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that which is good</span> for <span class="accented">good things</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Reverent</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, twice in 4 Maccabees (in 9:25, where the eldest of the seven brothers who suffered martyrdom ruder Antiochus Epiphanes is called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; and in 11:20, where it is coupled with <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "age," or "generation"); it is not uncommon in classical Greek.

That the aged men be sober; not thinking that the decays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort from nearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith works by, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need to be on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for every word, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all must be ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many expose themselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want of discretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young men are apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly called upon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pride than by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop the mouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thine uprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth which would fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him to speak of!</body></html>
