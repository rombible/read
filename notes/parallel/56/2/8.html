His words, too, must be well weighed and thoughtful, as well as earnest and impassioned; they must be such as would expose him neither to contempt nor to the charge of presumption. Between the lines of the exhortation of the 7th and 8th verses we can read the anxiety of the Apostle that his representative in Crete should take all possible care that the matter of his teaching and preaching was studied and prepared with all the attention and thought so important a duty demanded. He should remember, too, that the <span class= "ital">words</span> as well as the <span class= "ital">works</span> of the Christian teacher will be subject to a sharp and often hostile criticism. These warnings and reminders of St. Paul, it should be borne in mind, belong to all ages of the faith.<p><span class= "bld">That he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</span>--The older authorities, with one exception, read "of us," instead of "of you." If Titus fairly carries out the exhortation of the last two verses, then the enemy, either the false teacher or the Pagan opponent of Christianity, confounded by the pure, self-sacrificing, earnest life, overcome by the well-weighed, thoughtful utterance of great truths, by the impassioned exhortation to men and women to lead noble, honest lives, will surely be ashamed of his bitter opposition, when he finds neither in the life nor in the teaching anything which he can fairly criticise as "bad." As the better supported reading, "of us," associates St. Paul and others with Titus, the evil thing which might have been said of Titus in reality would be spoken against St. Paul and the elder Apostles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- Us</span> for <span class="accented">you</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Sound speech</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;</span>); still depending upon <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.

This marks the care that the Christian teacher must take not to say anything in his teaching rash, or reprehensible, or that can give offence or cause the ministry to be blamed (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">May be ashamed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fc7;</span>). In the active voice <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "to put to shame" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>), and in classical Greek. In the middle voice <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, followed by a genitive of the person, or an accusative in later Greek, means to "respect, reverence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-37.htm">Matthew 21:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-2.htm">Luke 18:2</a>, etc.). In the passive, as here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14</a>, it means "to be put to shame," "to be ashamed" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a> LXX., 35:40. (Compare, for the sentiment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-15.htm">1 Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>; and note the frequent resemblances between the pastoral Epistles and those of St. Peter.) The shame of the detractors consists in their being put to silence, having nothing to say, being proved to be slanderers. <span class="cmt_word">No evil thing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-29.htm">John 5:29</a>. The word means "<span class="accented">mean</span>, worthless, paltry," and is hence synonymous with <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Old disciples of Christ must behave in every thing agreeably to the Christian doctrine. That the aged men be sober; not thinking that the decays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort from nearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith works by, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need to be on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for every word, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all must be ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many expose themselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want of discretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young men are apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly called upon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pride than by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop the mouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thine uprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth which would fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him to speak of!</body></html>
