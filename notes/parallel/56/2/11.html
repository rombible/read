These words might be paraphrased thus: "Yes, exhort all classes and orders, every age of life, each sex, bond as well as free, to struggle after pure, good, righteous lives, for I tell you, in very truth, like a sun on a darkened world has the grace of God arisen with salvation in its beams." Compare the grand Isaiah passage, "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>); and also the words of Malachi (4:2), "Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings." (See, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm" title="The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, on them has the light shined.">Isaiah 9:2</a>.) The thought of these passages was not improbably in St. Paul's view while he wrote the words to Titus telling him to exhort his flock, for God's grace had appeared to all men. The Greek word translated "appeared" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-79.htm" title="To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.">Luke 1:79</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-20.htm" title="And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.">Acts 27:20</a>--both writings closely connected with St. Paul, if not in great part written by him--and in each of these passages it is used to express the shining of the sun. The "grace of God" here spoken of is that divine favour to and love for men upon which the wh<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men</span>, for <span class="accented">that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Bringing salvation to all men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The R.T. omits the article <span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which necessitates construing <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "saving to all men" "<span class="accented">bringing</span> salvation to all men." With the article <span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> as in the T.R., it may be taken either way, but it is rather more natural to construe <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "hath appeared to all men." The meaning of the phrase, "hath appeared to all <span class="accented">men</span>," is the same as the saying in the song of Simeon, "Mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30, 31</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>). The gospel is not a hidden mystery, but is proclaimed to the whole world. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as an adjective is found only here in the New Testament, in Wisd. 1:14 and 3Macc. 7:18, and frequently in classical Greek. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-15 The doctrine of grace and salvation by the gospel, is for all ranks and conditions of men. It teaches to forsake sin; to have no more to do with it. An earthly, sensual conversation suits not a heavenly calling. It teaches to make conscience of that which is good. We must look to God in Christ, as the object of our hope and worship. A gospel conversation must be a godly conversation. See our duty in a very few words; denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, living soberly, righteously, and godly, notwithstanding all snares, temptations, corrupt examples, ill usage, and what remains of sin in the believer's heart, with all their hinderances. It teaches to look for the glories of another world. At, and in, the glorious appearing of Christ, the blessed hope of Christians will be complete: To bring us to holiness and happiness was the end of Christ's death. Jesus Christ, that great God and our Saviour, who saves not only as God, much less as Man alone; but as God-man, two natures in one person. He loved us, and gave himself for us; and what can we do less than love and give up ourselves to him! Redemption from sin and sanctification of the nature go together, and make a peculiar people unto God, free from guilt and condemnation, and purified by the Holy Spirit. All Scripture is profitable. Here is what will furnish for all parts of duty, and the right discharge of them. Let us inquire whether our whole dependence is placed upon that grace which saves the lost, pardons the guilty, and sanctifies the unclean. And the further we are removed from boasting of fancied good works, or trusting in them, so that we glory in Christ alone, the more zealous shall we be to abound in real good works.</body></html>
