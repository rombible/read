In general appearance it resembles a guinea-pig or marmot.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The conies are but a feeble folk.</span> The term "coney" (<span class="accented">cuniculus</span>) is applied to the rabbit, but this is not the animal here intended; and indeed rabbits are not found in Palestine. The word <span class="accented">shaphan</span> designates the <span class="accented">Hyrax Syriacus</span>, called by some the rock badger (see Hatrt, 'Animals of the Bible,' pp. 64, etc.). The coney, says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 2:90), "abounds in the gorge of the Kedron, and along the foot of the mountains west of the Dead Sea. It is of the size of the rabbit, but belongs to a very different order of animals, being placed by naturalists between the hippopotamus and rhinoceros. Its soft fur is brownish-grey over the back, with long black hairs rising through this lighter coat, and is almost white on the stomach; the tail is very short. The Jews, who were not scientific, deceived by the motion of its jaws in eating, which is exactly like that of ruminant animals, fancied it chewed the cud, though it did not divide the hoof, and so they put its flesh amidst that which was forbidden. It lives in companies, and chooses a ready-made cleft in the rocks for its home, so that, though the conies are but a 'feeble folk,' their refuge in the rocks gives them a security beyond that of stronger creatures. They are, moreover, 'exceeding wise,' so that it is very hard to capture one. Indeed, they are said, on high authority, to have sentries regularly placed on the look out while the rest are feeding; a squeak from the watchman sufficing to send the flock scudding to their holes like rabbits. The coney is found in many parts of Palestine, from Lebanon to the Dead Sea." <span class="cmt_word">In the rocks.</span> This fact is noticed in Psalm'civ. 18. The Septuagint calls them <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-18.htm">Psalm 104:18</a>, also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-6.htm">Leviticus 11:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-7.htm">Deuteronomy 14:7</a>. This notion of the animal as a kind of little pig is not more accurate than that of St. Jerome, who renders the term by <span class="accented">lepusculus</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:24-28. Four things that are little, are yet to be admired. There are those who are poor in the world, and of small account, yet wise for their souls and another world. 29-33. We may learn from animals to go well; also to keep our temper under all provocations. We must keep the evil thought in our minds from breaking out into evil speeches. We must not stir up the passions of others. Let nothing be said or done with violence, but every thing with softness and calmness. Alas, how often have we done foolishly in rising up against the Lord our King! Let us humble ourselves before him. And having found peace with Him, let us follow peace with all men.</body></html>
