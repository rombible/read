Like Pharaoh, the haughty rich man asks with scorn, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). Septuagint, "Lest being filled I become false, and say, Who seeth me?" <span class="cmt_word">Or lest I be poor, and steal;</span> lest my necessities lead to dishonesty. <span class="cmt_word">And take the name of my God in vain.</span> The verb <span class="accented">taphas</span> means "to grasp at, seize violently, handle roughly," and the sin intended may be either false swearing in denial of his theft and to escape punishment, or the arraignment of God's providence which has allowed him to fall into such distress. Titus <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>, "They shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God." In view of the proverbs that follow, the clause seems to be best taken of the blasphemy attending on impatience and want of resignation to God's will (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:7-9 Agur wisely prayed for a middle state, that he might be kept at a distance from temptations; he asked daily bread suited to his station, his family, and his real good. There is a remarkable similarity between this prayer and several clauses of the Lord's prayer. If we are removed from vanity and lies; if we are interested in the pardoning love of Christ, and have him for our portion; if we walk with God, then we shall have all we can ask or think, as to spiritual things. When we consider how those who have abundance are prone to abuse the gift, and what it is to suffer want, Agur's prayer will ever be found a wise one, though seldom offered. Food convenient; what is so for one, may not be so for another; but we may be sure that our heavenly Father will supply all our need, and not suffer us to want anything good for us; and why should we wish for more?</body></html>
