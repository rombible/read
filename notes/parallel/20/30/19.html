Wisd. 5:11, "As when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found," etc. <span class="cmt_word">The way of a serpent upon a rock.</span> The snake's mode of progression by the lever-like motion of its ribs might well awake surprise, but the point is still the tracklessness of its course. On sand or soft ground its movements might be traced by the impression made. but this could not be done on hard rock; it could push itself along on such a surface without leaving any track. <span class="cmt_word">The way of a ship in the midst</span> (<span class="accented">heart</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the sea;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in the open sea. You can trace a ship's course while she is near land or within sight, but when she reaches the open sea, you can follow her furrow no longer. Wisd. 5:10, "As a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves." <span class="cmt_word">The way of a man</span> (<span class="accented">geber</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with a maid</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>); Septuagint, "The ways of a man in youth (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>)." So Vulgate, <span class="accented">Viam viri in adolescentia</span>. But this is feeble, and <span class="accented">almah</span> is without doubt rightly rendered "maid," "virgin." The proverb says that the sinful act to which it alludes leaves no outward sign by which it can generally be recognized; it escapes man's knowledge. This is exemplified and confirmed in the following verse. It is not sufficient to refer the saying to the insidious arts of the seducer, by which he saps the principles and inflames the passions of his victim. The sin of unchastity is signified, which demands secrecy and affords no token of its commission. Two of the above parallels, says Cheyne, are given in a quatrain of a Vedic hymn to Varuna - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The path of ships across the sea,<br />The soaring eagle's flight he knows."</span> Some of the Fathers and earlier commentators, and among moderns, Bishop Wordsworth, have not been content with the literal sense of this gnonic, but have found in it, as in the others, deep spiritual mysteries. Christ is the great Eagle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>), who ascended beyond human ken; the serpent is the devil, who works his wily way in secret, and who tried to pass into the mind of Christ, who is the Rock; the ship is the Church, which preserves its course amid the waves of this troublesome world, though we cannot mark its strength or whither it is guided; and the fourth mystery is the incarnation of Jesus Christ our Lord, when "the virgin (<span class="accented">almah</span>) conceived and bare a son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>), when "a woman encompassed a man (<span class="accented">geber</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a>). We can see the greater or less appropriateness of such accommodation, but the proverb must have been received by contemporaries only in its literal sense, whatever were the inner mysteries which the Holy Spirit wished to communicate thereby. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:10 Slander not a servant to his master, accuse him not in small matters, to make mischief. 11-14. In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence. Let those whom Providence has advanced from low beginnings, carefully watch against that sin which most easily besets them.</body></html>
