Every declaration of God in the inspired record, the Torah, is pure, as if refined in the fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Omnis sermo Dei est ignitus</span>; Septuagint, "All the words of God are tried in the fire (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)."

The Messiah is here spoken of as a Person distinct from the Father, but his name as yet secret. The great Redeemer, in the glories of his providence and grace, cannot be found out to perfection. Had it not been for Christ, the foundations of the earth had sunk under the load of the curse upon the ground, for man's sin. Who, and what is the mighty One that doeth all this? There is not the least ground to suspect anything wanting in the word of God; adding to his words opens the way to errors and corruptions.</body></html>
