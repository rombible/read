The word translated "to obey" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;</span>) is rendered by St. Jerome <span class="accented">partum</span>; by others, "weakness," or "wrinkles," or "old age," as Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. But etymology has led most modern commentators to give the sense of "obedience" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ravens of the valley shall pick it out.</span> Such an undutiful son shall die a violent death; his corpse shall lie unburied, and the birds of prey shall feed upon him. It is well known that ravens, vultures, and other birds that live on carrion first attack the eyes of their prey; and in our own islands we are told crows and birds of this sort will fix on the eyes of young or sickly animals. Corn. a Lapide quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 108:5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Effossos oculos voret atro gutture corvus,<br />Intestina canes, cetera membra lupi."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"His eyes, plucked out, let croaking ravens gorge,<br />His bowels dogs, his limbs the greedy wolves."</span> The valley, or brook, reminds one of Elijah's miraculous support (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Young eagles.</span> The <span class="accented">nesher</span> must here mean one of the vulture tribe, as eagles do not feed on carrion (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>). St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 18:49) applies the proverb thus: "'The eye that sneereth at his father, and despiseth the travail of his mother, lo! the ravens from the torrents shall pick it out.' For bad men, while they find limit with the judgments of God, do 'sneer at their Father;' and heretics of all sorts, whilst in mocking they contemn the preaching of holy Church and her fruitfulness, what else is this but that they 'despise the travail of their mother'? whom we not unjustly call the mother of them as well, because from the same they come forth, who speak against the same." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:10 Slander not a servant to his master, accuse him not in small matters, to make mischief. 11-14. In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence. Let those whom Providence has advanced from low beginnings, carefully watch against that sin which most easily besets them.</body></html>
