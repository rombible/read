The Vulgate has <span class="accented">minima</span>; but the original is not superlative, which would not be true of some of the creatures named. <span class="cmt_word">But they are exceeding wise;</span> "quick of wit, wise," the participle <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> meaning "rendered wise, cunning" (Delitzsch). The Septuagint and Vulgate translate in the comparatives. "These are wiser than the wise," the instincts of these animals being more marvellous than human wisdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:24-28. Four things that are little, are yet to be admired. There are those who are poor in the world, and of small account, yet wise for their souls and another world. 29-33. We may learn from animals to go well; also to keep our temper under all provocations. We must keep the evil thought in our minds from breaking out into evil speeches. We must not stir up the passions of others. Let nothing be said or done with violence, but every thing with softness and calmness. Alas, how often have we done foolishly in rising up against the Lord our King! Let us humble ourselves before him. And having found peace with Him, let us follow peace with all men.</body></html>
