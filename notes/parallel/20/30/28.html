As each first line of these four verses is an expression of weakness, it has been proposed to translate thus: "The lizard thou canst catch with the hands, and yet," etc. (Comp. for this praise of wisdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-14.htm" title="There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:">Ecclesiastes 9:14</a> s<span class= "ital">qq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The spider taketh hold with her hands.</span> <span class="accented">Semamith</span> or <span class="accented">shemamith</span> is some sort of lizard, probably the gecko. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint; <span class="accented">stellio</span>, Vulgate. The Authorized Version alludes either to its fanlike foot, which enables it to run up walls and to cling to ceilings, or to its power of exuding from its feet a certain poisonous humour by which it catches flies and other insects. But the above translation, as well as that of the Septuagint and the Vulgate <span class="accented">manibus nititur</span>, is incorrect, The first line, in accordance with the method pursued in the three cases previously, ought to give some expression denoting weakness or littleness, whereas by the above rendering it is rather strength and activity that are signified. The translation therefore should run, as in the Revised Version margin, "The lizard thou canst seize with thy hand," and yet it is in king's palaces. Small as it is, and easy to catch and crush, it is agile and clever enough to make its way into the very palace of the king, and to dwell there. Septuagint, "And the lizard, supporting itself by its hands, and being easy to catch (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), dwelleth in kings' strongholds." This combines the two interpretations given above. St. Gregory takes the lizard as the type of the simple, earnest man, who often succeeds better than the clever. "Many that are quick-witted, while they grow slack from carelessness, continue in bad practices, and the simple folk, which have no wing of ability to stand them in stead, the excellency of their practice bears up to attain to the walls of the eternal kingdom. Whereas, then, 'the lizard climbeth with his hands,' he 'is in kings' palaces;' in that the plain man, by earnestness of right practice, reaches that point whereunto the man of ability never mounts" ('Moral.,' 6:12, Oxford transl.). The ancient expositors see in these verses a presentation of the Church of God, weak on its human side and despised by men, yet exceeding wise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>) - like the ant, laying up treasure in heaven, providing for death and eternity; like the coney, making the Rock her refuge; like the locusts, moving forward a mighty army in battle array; like the lizard, active in movement, holding the truth tenaciously, and dwelling in the palace of the great King. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:24-28. Four things that are little, are yet to be admired. There are those who are poor in the world, and of small account, yet wise for their souls and another world. 29-33. We may learn from animals to go well; also to keep our temper under all provocations. We must keep the evil thought in our minds from breaking out into evil speeches. We must not stir up the passions of others. Let nothing be said or done with violence, but every thing with softness and calmness. Alas, how often have we done foolishly in rising up against the Lord our King! Let us humble ourselves before him. And having found peace with Him, let us follow peace with all men.</body></html>
