The leech is here chosen as the emblem of insatiable greed; if it could speak, its "daughters," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the words it would utter, would be "Give, give." So it forms an introduction to the quartette of "insatiable things" which follow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - Having spoken of insatiate cupidity, the writer now introduces four things which are insatiable. The form of the apothegm is climacteric, mounting from two to three, and thence to four, like the famous passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>, etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>, though there is no special stress there laid on the last member of the climax; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.</span> The word "crying" is not in the Hebrew, which says, "The <span class="accented">alukah</span> hath two daughters: Give! Give!" The insatiable appetite of this creature is represented by two words, which are personified as daughters, whom the mother has produced and dearly loves. This word <span class="accented">alukah</span> is not found again in the Old Testament; but in later Hebrew and in Aramaic it means "leech" or "bloodsucker;" and so it is translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, and by St. Jerome <span class="accented">sanguisuga</span>. The word is derived from a root which in Arabic means "to adhere." There are several kinds of leeches common in Palestine, and their bloodthirsty nature is well known; as Horace says, 'Ars Poet.,' 476 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Non missura cutem, nisi plena cruoris, hirudo."</span> It seems simple and quite satisfactory to accept the word thus, and to see in the voracity of the leech an example of the greed further developed in the following clauses; but commentators have not been contented with this explanation, and have offered various suggestions which are either unnecessary or inadmissible. Thus the Talmud considers <span class="accented">alukah</span> to be an appellation of hell, and the two daughters to be the Power of the world, and Heresy. Some of the Fathers regard it as a symbol of the devil and his dominion; others, as a personification of cupidity with its two offshoots avarice and ambition. Some moderns deem it to mean a vampire or blood thirsty demon, a ghoul, in accordance with Eastern myth. But, as we have said, such interpretations are unnecessary and unsupported by sufficient authority. The allusion to the tastes of the leech is found elsewhere. Thus Theocritus, 'Idyll.,' 2:55 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> And Plautus, 'Epidic.,' 2:2, 5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Jam ego me convortam in hirudinem atque<br />Eorum exsugebo sanguinem,<br />Senati qui columen cluent."</span> Ewald and others find traces of mutilation in this proverb, and endeavour to supply what is lost in various ways; but the text as it stands is intelligible, and needs no addition. The rest of the verse is an application of the truth first stated. The type of cupidity there enunciated is instanced and exemplified in four special cases. <span class="cmt_word">There are three things that are never satisfied.</span> And then a corrective climax is addressed. Yea, <span class="cmt_word">four things say not, It is enough.</span> The four in the following verse are divided into two plus two. Septuagint, "The leech had three daughters dearly beloved, and these three did not satisfy her, and the fourth was not contented to say, Enough." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:10 Slander not a servant to his master, accuse him not in small matters, to make mischief. 11-14. In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence. Let those whom Providence has advanced from low beginnings, carefully watch against that sin which most easily besets them.</body></html>
