Horace talks of a man as - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Victima nil miserantis Orci."</span><br />(<span class="note_acc">Carm.,' 2:3, 24.</span>) And Hesiod ('Theog.,' 456) of Hades as - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="accented">"A heart possessing that no pity knows."</span> The second thing is the barren womb; "the closing of the womb," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-9.htm">Isaiah 66:9</a>. The burning desire for children, characteristic of an Israelitish wife, is here denoted, like the passionate cry of Rachel to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>). The barren woman, says Corn. a Lapide, " concubitus magis est avida quam ceterae tum propter desiderium habendae prolis, tum quod foecundae et gravidae naturaliter non appetant concubitum." The third insatiable thing is <span class="cmt_word">the earth that is not filled</span> (<span class="accented">satisfied</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with water</span>; the parched and thirsty soil which no amount of water can satisfy, which drinks in all that is poured upon it and is not benefited, what Virgil ('Georg.,' 1:114) calls "bibula arena." <span class="cmt_word">The fourth is the fire that saith not,</span> <span class="cmt_word">It is enough;</span> the "devouring element," as the newspapers term it. The more you heap on fire, the more material you supply, the fiercer it rages. Septuagint, "Hades, and the love of woman, and earth not satisfied with water, and water, and fire, will not say, It sufficeth." Cheyne and others quote from the Sanscrit 'Hitopadesa,' "Fire is never satisfied with fuel; nor the ocean with rivers; nor death with all creatures; nor bright-eyed women with men." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:10 Slander not a servant to his master, accuse him not in small matters, to make mischief. 11-14. In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence. Let those whom Providence has advanced from low beginnings, carefully watch against that sin which most easily besets them.</body></html>
