THE REST OF THE BOOK IS COMPOSED OF THREE APPENDICES: (a) THE WORDS OF AGUR; (b) THE WORDS OF KING LEMUEL; AND (C) THE PRAISE OF A GOOD WIFE (Proverbs 30, 31).<p>APPENDIX (a).<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy.</span>--Jewish interpreters have seen in these titles (but apparently without a shadow of reason) a designation of Solomon himself, the "convener" and instructor of assemblies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm" title="The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm" title="The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>), son of the "obedient" man after God's own heart. But they in all probability belong to some otherwise unknown sage, whose utterances were thought not unworthy of being joined with those of the wise King of Israel himself. In support of this view <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm" title="And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.">1Kings 4:30</a> may be adduced as a proof of the estimation in which the wisdom of foreign nations was at this time held. The book of Job also, which possibly now was added to the canon of Scripture, is certainly of foreign, probably of Arabian, origin. Some light may be thrown upon the nationality of Agur by the words translated in the Authorised version "the prophecy" (<span class= "ital">massa</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>This is the term constantly employed to express the "utterance," or, more probably, the message which a prophet "bore<span class= "ital">" </span>to his hearers, often one of gloomy import (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1</a>, etc.). But the term is not very appropriate to the contents of this chapter, nor to the "words of King Lemuel," in Proverbs 31, and the expression, "the prophecy," standing quite alone, with no other words to qualify it, is very singular. For these reasons it has been proposed to translate the beginning of the verse thus: "The words of Agur the son of Jakeh the Massan," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a descendant of the Massa mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-14.htm" title="And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,">Genesis 25:14</a> as a son of Ishmael. This would place his home probably in North Arabia, and Lemuel would be king of the same tribe.<p><span class= "bld">The man spake.--</span>The word translated "spake" is most frequently used of the revelation of God to prophets, rarely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:">Numbers 24:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm" title="Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,">2Samuel 23:1</a>) of the utterances of inspired prophets; never of the words of ordinary men.<p><span class= "bld">Unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal.--</span>These most probably were disciples of his. As their names may mean "God with me," and "I am strong," a fanciful delineation of their characters, in the style of the "Pilgrim's Progress," has been attempted by some writers. And a mystical interpretation of them, "You must have God with you, if you are to be strong," may be found in Bishop Wordsworth's Commentary. It has been proposed also, as is possible with a slight change in the pointing, to translate these words thus: "I am weary, O God, I am weary, and am weak," or, "have made an end," and to make them an introduction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-2.htm" title="Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.">Proverbs 30:2</a>, which supplies the reason for this weariness, "For I am more brutish," etc. Thus is described, it has been thought, the sinking at heart of one who has sought after God, and the more he has realised the divine excellence, has become the more conscious of his own nothingness. But this rendering is unnecessary, as the Authorised version gives a good sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-33.</span> - Part VII. FIRST APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION, containing "the words of Agur." A short introduction, teaching that the Word of God is the source of wisdom (vers. 1-6), is followed by apothegms on different subjects (vers. 7-33). Cornelius a Lapide offers the following opinion concerning this appendix, which no one can hesitate to say is well founded, if he attempts to give it a spiritual interpretation, and to discern mysteries under the literal meaning: "Quarta haec pars elegantissima est et pulcherrima, aeque ac difficillima et obscurissima: priores enim tres partes continent Proverbia et Paraemias claras, ac antithesibus et similitudinibus perspicuas et illustres; haec vero continet aenigmata et gryphos insignes, sed arcanos et perdifficiles, turn ex phrasi quae involute est et aenigmatica, tum ex sensu et materia, quae sublimis est et profunda." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy.</span> This seems to be the correct rendering of the passage, though it has been made to bear very different interpretations. It is plainly the tide of the treatise which follows Wire Agur and Jakeh were is utterly unknown. The Jewish interpreters considered that "Agur son of Jakeh" was an allegorical designation of Solomon - <span class="accented">Agur</span> meaning "Gatherer," or "Convener" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>); <span class="accented">Jakeh</span>, "Obedient," or "Pious," which thus would indicate David. St. Jerome somewhat countenances the alle gorical interpretation by translating, <span class="accented">Verba Congregantis</span>, <span class="accented">filii Vomentis</span>, "The words of the Collector, son of the Utterer." But what follows could not apply to Solomon; he could not say, "I have not learned wisdom" (ver. 3), or ask blindly after the Creator (ver. 4). Many have endeavoured to find Agur's nationality in the word that follows, translated "the prophecy" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">hamassa</span>). <span class="accented">Massa</span> "burden," is usually applied to a solemn prophetical speech or oracle, a Divine utterance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>, etc.), and as this designation was deemed inappropriate to the character of this appendix, it has been thought that allusion is here made to a land of Massa, so called after a son of Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-14.htm">Genesis 25:14</a>), who dwelt in the country of Edom or Seir, and whose inhabitants were among those children of the East whose wisdom had become proverbial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>). Others find Massa in the Hauran, or on the north of the Persian Gulf. The Venetian Version gives, <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. But we have no satisfactory account of a country thus called, and its existence is quite problematical; therefore the ingenious explanations founded on the reality of this <span class="accented">terra ignota</span> need not be specified (see Introduction, pp. 21, etc.). Gratz has suggested that in place of <span class="accented">hamassa</span> should be read <span class="accented">hammoshel</span>, "the proverb writer;" but this is a mere conjecture, unsupported by any ancient authority. If, as seems necessary, we are compelled to resign the rendering, "of Masse," or "the Massan," we must fall back on the Authorized Version, and consider the term "oracle" as applied loosely and abnormally to these utterances of wisdom which follow. That they are not of the nature of Divine communications can be seen at once by consideration of their contents, which are mainly of human, and not of the highest type, and, though capable of spiritual interpretation, do not possess that uniqueness of purpose, that religious character and elevation of subject, which one expects in the enunciations of an inspired prophet. This view does not militate against their claim to be regarded as Holy Scripture; their place in the canon is secured by other considerations, and is not affected by our suspicion of the inappropriateness of the term applied to them; and, indeed, it may be that the very human element in these utterances is meant to be unsatisfying, and to lead one to look for the deep spiritual truths which underlie the secular surroundings. Agur is some poet or moralist, well known in Solomon's time, probably one of the wise men referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a> (see below). The rest of the paragraph is of greater obscurity than the former portion. <span class="cmt_word">The man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal.</span> According to this rendering, the man is Agur, who is introduced as uttering what follows in ver. 2, etc., to Ithiel and Ucal, two of his sons, pupils, or companions. The name Ucal occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament; Ithiel is found once, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-7.htm">Nehemiah 11:7</a>, as the name of a Benjamite. Wordsworth regards the names as symbolical of the moral character of those whom the author designs to address, explaining the former as equivalent to "God with me," and the latter as denoting "consumed" with zeal, or "strong," "perfect." It is as if the writer said, "You must have God with you; yea, you must have God with you, if you are to be strong. You must be Ithiels, if you are to be Ucals." He refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>. That the Masorites regarded these words as proper names is evident; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>, indeed, can have no other application. The Syriac takes this view of the words; to the same opinion lean, more or less, the Jewish translators Aquila and Theodotion, Aben Ezra, Vatablus, Pagninus, and others, and it is the simplest and easiest solution of the difficulties which have been seen in the clause. But many modern commentators have declared against it; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Hitzig, Zockler, Detitzsch, Bottcher, Nowack. The repetition of <span class="accented">Ithiel</span> seems unmeaning; one sees no reason why it should be repeated more than <span class="accented">Ucal</span>. The second verse begins with <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, which, as Hebraists agree, cannot stand abruptly at the commencement of a discourse, but rather establishes something that has preceded. But if we take the words in dispute as proper names, no statement to be confirmed has been made. We are, then, constrained to take them in another sense. St. Jerome translates them, writing, <span class="accented">Visio quam locutus est vir</span>, <span class="accented">cum quo est Deus</span>, <span class="accented">et qui Deo secum morante confortatus</span>. The LXX. (which in troduces vers. 1-14 of this chapter after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>) gives, "Those things saith the man to those who believe God, and I cease;" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> being the translation of the doubled <span class="accented">Ithiel</span>, equivalent to "God with me," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) being considered to be a formation from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>. Ewald takes the two words to be the name of one man, equivalent to "God with me, so I am strong;" in his own language, <span class="accented">Mitmirgott</span> - <span class="accented">sobinich stark</span>; but his idea of a dialogue between the rich mocker (vers. 2-4) and the humble believer (ver. 5-14) is not well founded, though a late editor, Strack, agreeing, considers that the only possible interpretation of these verses (2-4) is to make the speaker utter them as the outcome of his unbelief and scoffing, to which Agur answers in ver. 5. Under all circumstances, it has seemed to many scholars best to surrender the notion of proper names, and, altering the vocalization, to interpret, "The oracle of the man, 'I have wearied myself, O God, I have wearied myself, O God,'" or, as others say, "about God." The utterance commences here, and not at ver. 2. The repetition forcibly expresses the laborious and painful investigation of the seeker after truth. The final word, vocalized <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, is rendered, "And I have withdrawn;" or, as Bickell, quoted by Cheyne, gives, <span class="accented">v'lo ukal</span>, "I have not prevailed." We arrive thus at this interpretation: first comes the superscription, "The words of Agur," etc., "the oracle of the man;" then begins the utterance, which opens with the melancholy avowal that, though he had longed and striven to know God, his nature, his attributes, his working, he had failed in this object, and expended his labour in vain. Both Agur, and Lemuel who is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>, seem to have been persons not of Israelitish nationality, but dwelling in the neighbourhood of Palestine, and acquainted with the religion and sacred literature of the chosen people (see ver. 5). It is by no means unlikely that they were of the race of Ishmael, from which stock many wise men had risen, and where wisdom was so cultivated as to have become proverbial (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>). In what follows Agur shows himself as a philosopher and a critic, but at the same time a firm believer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-6 Agur speaks of himself as wanting a righteousness, and having done very foolishly. And it becomes us all to have low thoughts of ourselves. He speaks of himself as wanting revelation to guide him in the ways of truth and wisdom. The more enlightened people are, the more they lament their ignorance; the more they pray for clearer, still clearer discoveries of God, and his rich grace in Christ Jesus. In ver.</body></html>
