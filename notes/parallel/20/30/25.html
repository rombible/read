He calls the ants a people, <span class="accented">am</span>, because they live in a community, and have authorities which they obey, and their actions are regulated by certain definite laws. So Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>) calls the locusts a nation, and Homer ('Iliad,' 2:87) speaks of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the tribes of thronging bees." <span class="cmt_word">Yet they prepare their meat in the summer.</span> In countries where ants hybernate the object of this commended foresight is mistaken; but the statement, as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, is in accordance with the popular belief of the day, and serves well to point the moral intended. We know certainly that in Europe these insects fill their nests with heterogeneous articles - grain, seeds, husks, etc., not as stores to be consumed in the winter, but for warmth and comfort's sake. Scripture is not intended to teach science; it speaks of such matters phenomenally, with no attempt at a precision which would not have been understood or appreciated by contemporaries. But in the present case more careful observation has confirmed the correctness of the asset. tions in our proverbs. In countries where, ants do not hybernate, they do make granaries for themselves in the summer, and use these supplies as food in the winter months (see note on Proverbs 6:8). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:24-28. Four things that are little, are yet to be admired. There are those who are poor in the world, and of small account, yet wise for their souls and another world. 29-33. We may learn from animals to go well; also to keep our temper under all provocations. We must keep the evil thought in our minds from breaking out into evil speeches. We must not stir up the passions of others. Let nothing be said or done with violence, but every thing with softness and calmness. Alas, how often have we done foolishly in rising up against the Lord our King! Let us humble ourselves before him. And having found peace with Him, let us follow peace with all men.</body></html>
