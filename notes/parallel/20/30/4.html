He feels himself far off from possessing anything that may be called knowledge of God or of His works. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>.) The questions in this verse are intended to bring out the nothingness of man as compared with the might of the Creator of the Universe; they resemble Job 38-41, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm" title="Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?">Isaiah 40:12</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.</span><p><span class= "bld">Who hath bound the waters in a garment?--</span>Stretching out the clouds as a "curtain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm" title="Who cover yourself with light as with a garment: who stretch out the heavens like a curtain:">Psalm 104:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm" title="It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:">Isaiah 40:22</a>), to keep the rain from falling upon the earth.

We may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38.htm">Job 38</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended?</span> Who is he that hath his seat in heaven, and doeth works on earth? Who is he whose universal providence is felt and experienced? Where is this mysterious Being who hides himself from human ken? Christ has said something like this, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>); and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>). In biblical language God is said to come down from heaven in order to punish, to aid, to reveal his will, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, etc.); and he returns to heaven when this intervention is finished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-13.htm">Genesis 35:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?</span> Who hath the control of the viewless wind, so as to restrain it or release it at his pleasure? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). Septuagint, "Who hath gathered the winds in his bosom (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>)?" <span class="cmt_word">Who hath bound the waters in a garment?</span> The waters are the clouds which cover the vault of heaven, and are held, as it were, in a garment, so that, in spite of the weight which they contain, they fall not upon the earth. As Job says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>), "He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them." And again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), "Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven?" So the psalmist, "Thou coveredst it [the earth] with the deep as with a vesture" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a>). (See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">Who hath established all the ends of the earth?</span> Who hath consolidated the foundations, and defined the limits, of the remotest regions of the earth? (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>, etc.). The answer to these four questions is "Almighty God." He alone can order and control the forces of nature. <span class="cmt_word">What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</span> or, <span class="accented">if thou knowest</span>. It is not enough to acknowledge the power and operation and providence of this mysterious Being; Agur longs to know more of his nature, his essence. He must have personality; he is not an abstraction, a force, a quality; he is a Person. What, then, is his name, the name which expresses what he is in himself? Men have different appellations for this Supreme Being, according as they regard one or other of his attributes: is there one name that comprehends all, which gives an adequate account of the incomprehensible Creator? The question cannot be answered affirmatively in this life. "We know that if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). The further question, "What is his son's name?" has given some difficulty. The LXX. has, "What is the name of his children (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)?" as if there was reference to Israel, the special children of God. But the original does not bear out this interpretation, which is also opposed to the idea of the enigma proposed. The inquiry might mean - Are we to apply to the Supreme Being the same notion of natural relationship with which we are familiar in the human family? But this seems a low and unworthy conception. Or the "son" might be primeval man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>) or the sage; but the answer would not be satisfactory, and would not tend to solve the great question. There are two replies which can be made to Agur's interrogation. Looking to the marvellous description of Wisdom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, etc., we may consider Wisdom to be a denotation of the Son of God, and the inquirer desires to know the name and nature of this personage, of whose existence he was certified. Or he may have arrived at a knowledge of the only begotten Son of God, as the idea of the Logos is more or less developed in the Book of Wisdom, in Philo's treatises, and in the Alexandrian school; and longs for more perfect knowledge. This, indeed, is hidden: "He hath name written, which no one knoweth but he himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>). It is useless to put such question to a fellow man; no human mind can fathom the nature of the Godhead, or trace out its operations (Ecclus. 18:4, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:4, there is a prophetic notice of Him who came down from heaven to be our Instructor and Saviour, and then ascended into heaven to be our Advocate. The Messiah is here spoken of as a Person distinct from the Father, but his name as yet secret. The great Redeemer, in the glories of his providence and grace, cannot be found out to perfection. Had it not been for Christ, the foundations of the earth had sunk under the load of the curse upon the ground, for man's sin. Who, and what is the mighty One that doeth all this? There is not the least ground to suspect anything wanting in the word of God; adding to his words opens the way to errors and corruptions.</body></html>
