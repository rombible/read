The constant warnings against this form of corruption, from the time of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm" title="And you shall take no gift: for the gift blinds the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.">Exodus 23:8</a>) to that of the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm" title="For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.">Amos 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm" title="Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.">Isaiah 1:23</a>, &c), show the prevalence of the evil in Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - There is a breath of satire in this verse. <span class="cmt_word">A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it.</span> "A precious stone" is literally "a stone of grace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>). The gnome expresses the idea that a bribe is like a bright jewel that dazzles the sight and affects the mind of him who receives it (see on Proverbs 15:27; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>). Ovid, 'Art. Amat.,' 3:653 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Munera, crede mihi, capiunt hominesque deosque;<br />Placatur donis Jupiter ipse datis."</span> It is possible that the gnome may have a more general application, and apply to gifts given to appease anger or to prove friendship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>). Septuagint, "A reward of graces is discipline to those who use it;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> moral discipline brings an ample reward of graces to those who practise it. <span class="cmt_word">Whithersoever it turneth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">it prospereth</span>. The Authorized Version refers these words to the gift. Delitzsch points out that the words are more properly taken of the person who receives the gift, so that they should be rendered, "Wheresoever he turneth himself he dealeth wisely." Inflamed by sordid hopes and the love of gain, he acts with all possible skill and prudence in order to work out his wages and show that he was rightly selected to receive the present. The verse merely states a common trait among unscrupulous men, and pronounces no judgment upon it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8. Those who set their hearts upon money, will do any thing for it. What influence should the gifts of God have on our hearts! 9. The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves. 10. A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man. 11. Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man. 12. Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men. 13. To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family. 14. What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin. 15. It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty. 16. Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 17. No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment. 18. Let not any wrong their families. Yet Christ's becoming Surety for men, was a glorious display of Divine wisdom; for he was able to discharge the bond.</body></html>
