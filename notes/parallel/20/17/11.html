(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-34.htm" title="So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.">1Kings 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-46.htm" title="So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell on him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.">1Kings 2:46</a>.) The ministers of the Divine wrath against impenitent sinners appear as "tormentors" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-34.htm" title="And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.">Matthew 18:34</a>. (For the office of the angels in the same work, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-6.htm" title="And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.">Revelation 8:6</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An evil man seeketh only rebellion.</span> So the Greek and Latin Versions; but, as Nowack intimates, a bad man seeks many other things which do not come directly in the category of rebellion; and it is better to take <span class="accented">meri</span>, "rebellion," as the subject, regarding it as put for the concrete, thus: "A rebellious man striveth only for what is evil." From the point of view of an Eastern potentate, this is true enough. Absolute government looks upon any rising against constituted authority, any movement in the masses, as necessarily evil, and to be repressed with a high hand. Hence the succeeding clause. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</span> The "cruel messenger" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-14.htm">Proverbs 16:14</a>) is the executioner of the king's wrath (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-29.htm">1 Kings 2:29</a>, etc.). He is called "cruel" because his errand is deadly, and he is pitiless in its performance. This seems to be the sense intended. The LXX. gives a different notion, derived from the ambiguous term <span class="accented">malak</span>, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: "The Lord will send forth a pitiless angel against him." The verse then becomes a statement concerning the retribution inflicted by God on obstinate sinners, such as Pharaoh and the Egyptians. These are delivered over to "the tormentors" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a>), the angels that execute the wrath of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-6.htm">Revelation 8:6</a>, etc. As all sin is rebellion against God, it is natural to read into the passage a religious meaning, and for homiletical purposes it is legitimate to do so. But the writer's intention is doubtless as explained above, though his language may be divinely directed to afford a further application. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8. Those who set their hearts upon money, will do any thing for it. What influence should the gifts of God have on our hearts! 9. The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves. 10. A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man. 11. Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man. 12. Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men. 13. To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family. 14. What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin. 15. It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty. 16. Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 17. No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment. 18. Let not any wrong their families. Yet Christ's becoming Surety for men, was a glorious display of Divine wisdom; for he was able to discharge the bond.</body></html>
