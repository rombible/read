Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid prodest stulto habere divitias, cum sapientiam emere non possit</span>? The rabbis in later time were not allowed to take fees for teaching; but it was customary to make offerings to seers and wise men, when their services were engaged or their advice was asked (see the case of Saul and Samuel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7, 8</a>). The last clause gives the reason why it is useless for a fool to try to learn wisdom even at a large expenditure on teachers. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he hath no heart to it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no capability for receiving it; his mental digestion cannot assimilate it. The heart, as we have already noticed, is regarded as the seat of the understanding. Thus the LXX., "Why doth a fool have wealth? for a man without heart cannot acquire wisdom." In the Gospel Christ calls his disciples "fools and slow of heart to believe what the prophets had written, and himself opened their mind (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>), that they might understand the Scriptures" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25, 45</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate here introduce a distich derived from portions of vers. 19, 20, "He who raises his house high seeketh destruction; and he who perversely declineth from learning (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) shall fall into evils." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8. Those who set their hearts upon money, will do any thing for it. What influence should the gifts of God have on our hearts! 9. The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves. 10. A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man. 11. Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man. 12. Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men. 13. To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family. 14. What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin. 15. It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty. 16. Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 17. No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment. 18. Let not any wrong their families. Yet Christ's becoming Surety for men, was a glorious display of Divine wisdom; for he was able to discharge the bond.</body></html>
