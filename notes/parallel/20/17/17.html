A real friend loves his friend in prosperity and adversity; yea, he is more than a friend in time of need - he is a brother, as affectionate and as trusty as one connected by the closest ties of relationship (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>). Siracides gives a very cruel version of this proverb, "A friend cannot be known in prosperity; and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity. In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved; but in his adversity even a friend will depart" (Ecclus. 12:8, etc.). Cicero had a truer notion of the stability of friendship when he quoted Ennius's dictum, "Amicus certus in re incerta cernitur" ('De Amicit.,' 17.). Misfortune, says our maxim, is the touchstone of friendship; and one Greek gnome enjoins - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Thy friend's misfortunes deem to be thine own;"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>while another runs - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The crisis tests a friend, as fire the gold."</span> Septuagint, "Have thou a friend forevery crisis, and let brethren be useful in adversities; for for this they are made." Commenting on the expression, "is born," Wordsworth fancifully remarks, "Adversity brings him forth. He comes, as it were, out of the womb of calamity, and seems to be born for it." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8. Those who set their hearts upon money, will do any thing for it. What influence should the gifts of God have on our hearts! 9. The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves. 10. A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man. 11. Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man. 12. Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men. 13. To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family. 14. What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin. 15. It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty. 16. Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 17. No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment. 18. Let not any wrong their families. Yet Christ's becoming Surety for men, was a glorious display of Divine wisdom; for he was able to discharge the bond.</body></html>
