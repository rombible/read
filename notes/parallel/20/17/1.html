The consumption of these may have at times degenerated into licence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-13.htm" title="Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.">1Samuel 1:13</a>), and quarrelling have ensued.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - (Comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Better</span> (sweeter) <span class="cmt_word">is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith.</span> Dry bread was soaked in wine or water before it was eaten. Thus Boaz bid Ruth "dip her morsel in the vinegar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>); thus Jesus gave the sop to Judas when he had dipped it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>). The Septuagint is pleonastic, "Better is a morsel with joy in peace." Aben Ezra connects this verse with the last two of ch. 16, confining the application to the patient man; but the sentence seems rather to be independent and general. <span class="cmt_word">Than an house full of sacrifices with strife.</span> Of the thank or peace offerings part only was burnt upon the altar, the rest was eaten by the offerer and his family; and as the victims were always the choicest animals, "a house full of sacrifices" would contain the materials for sumptuous feasting (see on Proverbs 7:4). The joyous family festival often degenerated into excess, which naturally led to quarrels and strife (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5, 6, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>, etc.). So the agapae of the early Church were desecrated by licence and selfishness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>, etc.). Septuagint, "than a house full of many good things and unrighteous victims with contention." With this verse compare the Spanish proverb, "Mas vale un pedazo de pan con amor, que gallinas con dolor." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1 These words recommend family love and peace, as needful for the comfort of human life. 2. The wise servant is more deserving, and more likely to appear one of the family, than a profligate son. 3. God tries the heart by affliction. He thus has often shown the sin remaining in the heart of the believer.</body></html>
