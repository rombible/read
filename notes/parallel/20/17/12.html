The ferocity of the bear when deprived of its young had become proverbial (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>; Hart, 'Animals of the Bible,' 28, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Rather than a fool in his folly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the paroxysm of his passion.

Oort supposes that this proverb arose from the riddle, "What is worse to meet than a bear?" Septuagint, "Care will fall upon a man of understanding; but fools imagine evils." The Greek translators take "bear" as us d metaphorically for terror and anxiety, but go far astray from the Hebrew text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8. Those who set their hearts upon money, will do any thing for it. What influence should the gifts of God have on our hearts! 9. The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves. 10. A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man. 11. Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man. 12. Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men. 13. To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family. 14. What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin. 15. It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty. 16. Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 17. No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment. 18. Let not any wrong their families. Yet Christ's becoming Surety for men, was a glorious display of Divine wisdom; for he was able to discharge the bond.</body></html>
