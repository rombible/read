(the verse is omitted by the Vatican LXX.), Targum, and Syriac, agree in rendering this verse, "The beginning of wisdom is get wisdom," which is equivalent to saying that the beginning of wisdom consists in the acquisition of wisdom, or, as Umbreit explains, "in the resolution to get wisdom." That this rendering, which is adopted by Luther, Delitzsch, and Umbreit, may be correct appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> and Proverbs 9:10, where we have the same construction, only in inverted order. Seneca's aphorism is conceived in much the same spirit: "Magna pars boni est velle fieri bonum" - "A large part of good is the wish to become good;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the beginning of being good depends to a large extent upon the wish to become so. The objections to this rendering are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it is difficult to see how the beginning of wisdom can be the acquisition of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That elsewhere, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> and Proverbs 9:10, the beginning of wisdom is represented as the fear of the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That it does not fall in well with the context or with the aim of the father's teaching, which is to hold up wisdom as pre-eminently a blessing, as the most excellent and highest thing attainable. On the other hand, Hitzig, De Dieu, Doderlein, Zockler, render as in the Authorized Version, "Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom is the highest good, and therefore ought to be obtained. The word <span class="accented">reshith</span> is found with this signification in ch. 24:20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1-6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And with all thy getting get understanding</span>. This does not mean, as the Authorized Version seems to imply, that while you are acquiring other things, you are to acquire wisdom, but that wisdom is to be purchased with all you have acquired or gotten. "Getting" (<span class="accented">kin'yon</span>) is the purchase money. No price is too high to be paid for her, no sacrifice too great; cf. the parables of the hidden treasure and goodly pearl (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a>), in both of which the man sold "all that he had" to obtain the prize. There is a play upon the words in the original (<span class="accented">kin'yan'ki k'neh</span>), which is preserved in our translation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-13 We must look upon our teachers as our fathers: though instruction carry in it reproof and correction, bid it welcome. Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.</body></html>
