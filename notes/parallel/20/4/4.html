His object in doing so is to show that his own teaching was in harmony with it, and therefore worthy of attention. His precepts, admonitions, and warnings are not his only, but those of his father. Other examples of David's instructions to Solomon are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-12.htm">1 Chronicles 22:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he taught;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his father, for <span class="accented">vayyoreni</span> is masculine. The LXX. renders, "They said and taught me (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>)," as if the precepts which follow were the combined teaching of David and Bathsheba. This variation is due to the mention of both parents in the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">Retain</span>; <span class="accented">yith'mok</span>, kal future, used imperatively, of <span class="accented">thamak</span>, "to take hold of," and metaphorically, as here, "to hold fast" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>). The LXX. Renders <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, imperative of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;</span>, "to fix firm." Symmachus has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, "give heed to." <span class="cmt_word">And live;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and thou shalt live, as the kal imperative, <span class="accented">kh'yeh</span>, from <span class="accented">khayah</span>, "to live," has here the force of the future (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">et vives</span>). The meaning is, "And thou shalt enjoy a long and happy life." Temporal life alone seems to be indicated, as in ver. 10 (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>). The Syriac addition, "And my law as the apple of thine eye," is probably borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-2.htm">Proverbs 7:2</a>, where we meet with the mine admonition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-13 We must look upon our teachers as our fathers: though instruction carry in it reproof and correction, bid it welcome. Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.</body></html>
