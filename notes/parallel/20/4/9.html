(On this, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee;</span> or, as margin, <span class="accented">she shall compass thee with a crown of glory. Deliver.</span> The verb <span class="accented">miggen</span>, piel, since the kal, <span class="accented">magan, is</span> not used. is, however, properly, "to give, or deliver," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>. That this is the meaning is clear from the corresponding "she shall give" (<span class="accented">titten</span>, but cf. <span class="accented">nathan</span>, "to give"). It is commonly found with an accusative and dative, but here takes two accusatives. Both the LXX. and the Vulgate render, "With a crown of glory or delights shall she protect (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">proteget</span>) thee:" as if it were connected with <span class="accented">magen</span>, "a shield," but a crown is not usually associated with protection or defence. "A crown of glory," in the New Testament, is always associated with the everlasting honours of heaven, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>. The meaning is here, "Wisdom shall confer on thee true dignity." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-13 We must look upon our teachers as our fathers: though instruction carry in it reproof and correction, bid it welcome. Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.</body></html>
