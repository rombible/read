The former is, by an extremely beautiful image, likened to the light at dawn, which goes on increasing in brightness and intensity as the day advances, until at length it reaches its meridian splendour and glory. An exactly similar figure is found in David's last words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The path of the just;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their moral course. <span class="cmt_word">As the shining light</span> (<span class="accented">k'or nogah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the light of dawn. The word <span class="accented">nogah</span>, from <span class="accented">nagah</span>, "to shine," is a noun, and properly signifies "brightness," "shining." "splendour." It is used also to designate the dawn, the light of the sun when it first mounts the horizon, and sheds its beams over the landscape, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>, "Kings (shall come) to the brightness (<span class="accented">nogah</span>) of thy rising;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>, "Until the righteousness thereof go forth as the brightness (<span class="accented">nogah</span>)" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>, where the same word also occurs). Michaelis and Schultens refer <span class="accented">nogah</span> to "the path," and render, "The path of the just is splendid as the light." So Dathe and others; and in this sense it was understood by the LXX., "The path of the just shall shine as the light shines." The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">quasi lux splendens. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That shineth more and more</span> (<span class="accented">holek vaor</span>); literally, <span class="accented">going and shining</span> - a common Hebrew idiom denoting progression or increase. The construction of the participle <span class="accented">holek</span>, from <span class="accented">halak</span>, "to go," with the participle of another verb, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-41.htm">1 Samuel 17:41</a>, "The Philistine came nearer and nearer (<span class="accented">holek v'karev</span>);" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>. "The child Samuel grew on more and more (<span class="accented">holek v'hadel</span>)" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-11.htm">Jonah 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the perfect day</span> (<span class="accented">ad-n'kon hayyom</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">usque ad perfectam diem.</span> The Hebrew, <span class="accented">n'kon hayyom</span>, corresponds to the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>, equivalent to "the high noon," when the sun seems <span class="accented">to stand still</span> in the heavens. The figure, as Fleiseher remarks, is probably derived from the balance, the tongue of the balance of day, which before or after is inclined either to the right or the left, being at midday perfectly upright, and as it were firm. So <span class="accented">kun</span>, the unused kal, from which <span class="accented">n'kon</span>, the niph. participle, is derived, is "to stand upright," and in hiph. "to be set," "to stand firm," "to be established," and hence the expression might be rendered, "until the steady, or established day," which, however, refers to the midday, or noon, and not to that point when day succeeds dawn, as Rosenmuller and Schultens on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a> maintain. The comparison is not extended beyond the midday, because the wish of the father was to indicate the full knowledge which the just attain in God, and which can knew of no decline. A similar figure of gradual development is found in our Lord's parable of the seed growing secretly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-28.htm">Mark 4:28</a>), and is visible in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>, "They grow from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God." The verse illustrates the gradual growth and increase of the righteous in knowledge, holiness, and joy, all of which are inseparably connected in the career of such. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-27 The way of evil men may seem pleasant, and the nearest way to compass some end; but it is an evil way, and will end ill; if thou love thy God and thy soul, avoid it. It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.</body></html>
