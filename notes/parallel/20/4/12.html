The whole course of life shall be freed from obstacles or impediments, from anxiety, perplexity, or difficulty, or from vacillation. <span class="cmt_word">When thou goest</span> may refer to the daily walk, to the common and ordinary events or circumstances incidental to life, just as the corresponding <span class="cmt_word">when thou runnest</span> may refer to cases of emergency when promptness and decisive action are called for. In both cases Wisdom, by inspiring unity of principle, gives freedom of movement; in ordinary cases it removes embarrassment and perplexity arising from conflicting interests drawing now in one direction, now in another, and in extraordinary cases it supplies a rule of conduct which prevents our falling into mistakes and errors. Or the verse may refer to the prosperity which shall attend all the undertakings of those who are in Wisdom's ways, whether they advance slowly or rush forward with the impetuosity of youth, whether they act with deliberation or with haste. <span class="cmt_word">Shall not be straitened</span> (<span class="accented">lo-yetsar</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall not be narrowed or confined; Vulgate, <span class="accented">non arctabuntur</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, The future <span class="accented">yetsar</span> only occurs four times in the Scriptures - here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19</a>. It is usually derived from the root <span class="accented">yatsar</span>, which, however, is not found, cognate with <span class="accented">tsur</span>, "to straiten," "to be narrow." <span class="accented">Yetsar</span>, however, always occurs in the passive sense, though an active signification is given it by the Rabbi Nathan ben Jechiel, quoted by Delitzsch, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, who renders, "Thou shall not need to bind together, or hedge up thy way." The roots <span class="accented">yatsar</span> and <span class="accented">tsur</span> partake more or less of the idea of binding up, oppressing, putting into narrow and confined circumstances and limits. By the expression that "the steps are straitened" we may understand, therefore, that there is a want of freedom for their movements, and consequently that they are impeded or cramped. The Arabic expression. "to contract the feet," signifies the diminishing of good fortune. Compare the similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>, "The steps of his strength shall be straitened." The psalmist presents the idea of the verse under a different form, "Thou hast <span class="accented">enlarged</span> my steps under me, so that my feet did not slip" (Psalm 17:36). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not stumble;</span> <span class="accented">lo-thik-kashel</span>, hiph. future. The niph. <span class="accented">nikshal</span>, equivalent to the kal <span class="accented">kadshal</span>, signifies properly "to totter," "to sink down," used of one about to fall. The primary idea, however, usually disregarded, of <span class="accented">kashal</span>, is "to totter in the ankles," equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">talipedare.</span> It occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>, and is a different verb from "stumble" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a> (which see). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-13 We must look upon our teachers as our fathers: though instruction carry in it reproof and correction, bid it welcome. Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.</body></html>
