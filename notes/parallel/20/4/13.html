This latter conviction is the reason why he urges "taking fast hold" of Wisdom. The tenacious grasp with which the shipwrecked sinking sailor lays hold on any spar or plank floating near will illustrate the kind of grasp with which Wisdom is to be held. It is no less a virtue to keep and hold fast a good thing than to get it at the first beginning (Muffet). <span class="cmt_word">Instruction</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>), usually of a disciplinary nature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>), here more particularly the instruction of the father, but in a wider sense wisdom generally, with which it is synonymous, as appears from the feminine, "let <span class="accented">her</span> not go, keep <span class="accented">her</span>," <span class="accented">musar</span> being masculine; or the feminines may refer back to "Wisdom" in ver. 11. So Mercerus and Buxtorf. <span class="cmt_word">For she is thy life</span> (<span class="accented">ki hi khayyeka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she brings life to thee. Wisdom is represented as the bestower of long life, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2, 16, 18</a>. Just in proportion as Wisdom is retained and guarded, so is life secured, and so far as the hold upon her is lost, so are the hopes of life diminished. Life depends upon the observance of her precepts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-13 We must look upon our teachers as our fathers: though instruction carry in it reproof and correction, bid it welcome. Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.</body></html>
