It is equivalent to the kal form. The pilpel form only occurs here, but the kal participle is met with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a>, where it has the meaning of "to raise up as a causeway" (see marginal reading <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Gesenius renders, "exalt her," <span class="accented">sc.</span> with praises. The meaning of the verb, as Delitzsch says, is to be determined, by the corresponding "she shall promote thee" (<span class="accented">th'rom'mek</span>), and this verb <span class="accented">romem</span> is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to raise or make high; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to exalt by bestowing honours upon one of low estate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> raising them in general estimation; it is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a> by Hannah, in her song of thankfulness, "He (Jehovah) bringeth low and lifteth up (<span class="accented">m'romem</span>);" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to extol by praises, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2</a>. The radical meaning of <span class="accented">salal</span> seems to be "to heap up," as a road is prepared by embankments, and by the filling up of inequalities (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). In this sense the passage before us is explained by Levi ben Gersom, "Prepare the way of Wisdom, and walk assiduously in it." But the context, wherein the idea of buying is evidently used. favours Bottcher's interpretation, "Hold it or her high in price, bid high for her as a purchaser who makes offer upon offer, to secure what he wants." So Pi, <span class="accented">in pretio habe.</span> The LXX. rendering, "Circumvallate her, enclose her with a wall or hedge," which is reproduced in the Arabic, <span class="accented">circumsepi eam</span>, "hedge her around," seems out of place with the context. The Talmudists understand the verb as signifying "to examine closely," "to scrutinize, meditate, or reflect" upon Wisdom constantly, just as the Roman, poet says, "Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna" - "We exalt Wisdom when we follow her precepts," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when we esteem her - the idea which is presented to us in the Targum and Syriac cited above. The sentiment of the verse agrees with what Jehovah says in the message of the man of God to Eli, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>, "Them that honour me I will honour." <span class="cmt_word">She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</span> The LXX. reverses the order of ideas, "Honour her in order that she may embrace thee." <span class="accented">Embrace her</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a loving and affectionate manner, as a husband does his wife, or a son his mother. (For the verb <span class="accented">khavak</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-6.htm">Song of Solomon 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-3.htm">Song of Solomon 8:3</a>.) There are only three other instances where this verb occurs in the pilel form, <span class="accented">khibbek.</span> Esteem and honour, the confidence of others, elevation to offices of trust and consequence, are some of the rewards with which Wisdom repays those who esteem and love her. Others follow in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-13 We must look upon our teachers as our fathers: though instruction carry in it reproof and correction, bid it welcome. Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.</body></html>
