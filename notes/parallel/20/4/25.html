As a noun, the word <span class="accented">nokakh</span>, rendered "right on," signifies what is straight in front of one; adverbially, it has the same meaning as that given in the Authorized Version. The corresponding "before" (<span class="accented">neged</span>) is substantively the side of any object which is opposite one, and as a preposition is equivalent to "before," "in the presence of," like the Latin <span class="accented">coram.</span> The versions (LXX., Syriac, Targum) take <span class="accented">nokakh</span> in the sense of "right things:" "Let thine eyes look at right things;" contemplate them, aim at justice and equity. This meaning is given to the cognate adjective <span class="accented">nakoakh</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-9.htm">Proverbs 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-26.htm">Proverbs 24:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>; but in the Proverbs the word <span class="accented">nokakh</span> only occurs twice (here and ver. 21), either as an adverb, "right on," "straightforwardly," or as a preposition, "before." <span class="accented">Look straight.</span> Gesenius takes this verb <span class="accented">yashar</span> in hiph., "to make straight," as used elliptically: "Let thine eyelids <span class="accented">direct</span> a way before thee;" but the meaning is the same as "Let them look straight before thee." The Syriac, Gejerus, and Holden render, "Let thine eyelids direct thy way before thee;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do nothing rashly, but everything with premeditation; examine thy conduct, and see that it is right. The verb <span class="accented">yashar</span> has this meaning, "to direct," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>, but it is here used intransitively (Mercerus). <span class="accented">Eyelids</span> (<span class="accented">aph'appim</span>); so called from their fluttering, rapid motion, here used by way of poetic parallelism with "eyes." What the command inculcates is simplicity of aim or principle, singleness of motive. The moral gaze is to be steadily fixed, because if it wanders indolently, lasciviously, aimlessly, it imperils the purity of the soul. This verse may be understood, as Zockler, as containing a command levelled against dishonest practices. The man who intends to cheat his neighbour looks this way and that how he may deceive him. Such an interpretation may be maintained on the ground that the former verse is directed against falsehood in <span class="accented">speech</span>; this against falsehood in <span class="accented">action.</span> But the former view is preferable. If you wish to keep the heart, you must be guided by simplicity of aim; look not aside either to the one hand or to the other, lest you may be led astray by the seductions and temptations which imperil the onward and upward progress of the soul. The passage reminds us of the "single eye" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), "simple," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> intent on heaven and God, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-27 The way of evil men may seem pleasant, and the nearest way to compass some end; but it is an evil way, and will end ill; if thou love thy God and thy soul, avoid it. It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.</body></html>
