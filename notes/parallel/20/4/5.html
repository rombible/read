This subject seems to be continued in ver. 13, where the second and concluding branch of the instruction begins, which consists mainly of warning, as the first part does with exhortation. We are thus furnished with an example how to teach. In our teaching it is not sufficient simply to point out what is to be done, but we must show what is to be avoided. <span class="cmt_word">Get wisdom, get understanding</span>. The father urges the acquirement of wisdom in the same way and with the same importunity as the trader or merchant presses his goods upon buyers. Wisdom and understanding are put forward as objects of merchandise; for the verb <span class="accented">kanah</span>, from which the imperative <span class="accented">k'neh</span>, signifies not only "to acquire for one's self," or "to possess," but especially "to buy." The verb occurs again in the same sense in ver. 7, "Get [<span class="accented">k'neh, i.e.</span> buy] wisdom;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-23.htm">Proverbs 23:23</a>, "Buy (<span class="accented">k'neh</span>) the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>: 16:16; 19:9, where we also meet with the same verb). The reiteration of the word "get," as Umbreit remarks, is "an imitation of the exclamation of a merchant who is offering his wares." The importunity of the father measures the value he sets upon wisdom as an inestimable treasure, a pearl of great price (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Forget it not,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">forget not, neither turn from the words of my mouth</span>, - so Zockler, Delitzsch, Hodg., and others; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne obliviscaris, neque declines a verbis oris mei.</span> There is no need to supply "it" after the verb <span class="accented">al-tish'-kakh</span>, "forget not," as Holden states, and as appears in the Authorized Version, since <span class="accented">shakakh is</span> found with <span class="accented">min</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>), "of" or "from," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-4.htm">Psalm 12:4</a> (5), "I forgot to eat (<span class="accented">shakakh'ti meakol</span>)," and the same construction may obtain here. The two verbs, "forget" and "decline from," are not so very wide in meaning, since the former, <span class="accented">shakakh</span>, is to "leave" something from forgetfulness, and the latter, <span class="accented">natah</span>, rendered here "decline from," is "to turn away" from something. <span class="cmt_word">The words of my mouth</span> represent as it were the means by which wisdom may be purchased. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-13 We must look upon our teachers as our fathers: though instruction carry in it reproof and correction, bid it welcome. Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.</body></html>
