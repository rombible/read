Such a one, in his haste and passion, does things which in calmer moments he must see are foolish and ridiculous. Says Euripides ('Hyp.,' Fragm.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"Wiser is every man from passion freed." Be not angry, says the Talmud, "and you will not sin." Cato, 'Dist.,' 1:37 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ipse tibi moderare tuis ut parcere possis."</span> <span class="cmt_word">And a man of wicked devices is hated.</span> The contrast is not between the different ways in which the two characters are regarded, as that one is despised and ridiculed, and the other hated; but two kinds of evil are set forth in contradistinction, viz. hasty anger and deliberate plotting against others. Septuagint, "The irascible man (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) acts without deliberation. but the prudent man endureth much." The Hebrew term, "man of devices," being ambiguous, the LXX. takes it in a favourable sense, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and they have a different reading of the verb. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1 A woman who has no fear of God, who is wilful and wasteful, and indulges her ease, will as certainly ruin her family, as if she plucked her house down. 2. Here are grace and sin in their true colours. Those that despise God's precepts and promises, despise God and all his power and mercy. 3. Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words of wise men get them out of difficulties. 4. There can be no advantage without something which, though of little moment, will affright the indolent. 5. A conscientious witness will not dare to represent anything otherwise than according to his knowledge. 6. A scorner treats Divine things with contempt. He that feels his ignorance and unworthiness will search the Scriptures in a humble spirit. 7. We discover a wicked man if there is no savour of piety in his discourse. 8. We are travellers, whose concern is, not to spy out wonders, but to get to their journey's end; to understand the rules we are to walk by, also the ends we are to walk toward. The bad man cheats himself, and goes on in his mistake. 9. Foolish and profane men consider sin a mere trifle, to be made light of rather than mourned over. Fools mock at the sin-offering; but those that make light of sin, make light of Christ. 10. We do not know what stings of conscience, or consuming passions, torment the prosperous sinner. Nor does the world know the peace of mind a serious Christian enjoys, even in poverty and sickness. 11. Sin ruins many great families; whilst righteousness often raises and strengthens even mean families. 12. The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers. See the vanity of carnal mirth. 14. Of all sinners backsliders will have the most terror when they reflect on their own ways. 15. Eager readiness to believe what others say, has ever proved mischievous. The whole world was thus ruined at first. The man who is spiritually wise, depends on the Saviour alone for acceptance. He is watchful against the enemies of his salvation, by taking heed to God's word. 16. Holy fear guards against every thing unholy. 17. An angry man is to be pitied as well as blamed; but the revengeful is more hateful.</body></html>
