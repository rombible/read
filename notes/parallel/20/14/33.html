"A fool's heart is ever dancing on his lips," says a proverb. So Ecclus. 21:26, "The heart of fools is in their mouth; but the mouth of the wise is in their heart." Theognia, 1163 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x2e;</span><br /><br /><span class="accented">"The eyes, and tongue, and ears, and mind alike<br />Are centred in the bosom of the wise."</span> Vulgate, "In the heart of the prudent resteth wisdom, and it will teach all the unlearned." Wisdom sits enshrined in the intelligent man's mind, and thence disseminates instruction and light around to all who need it. The Septuagint, with which agree the Syriac, Aquila, and Theodotion, inserts a negative in the second clause, thus: "In the good heart of a man shall rest wisdom, but in the heart of fools it is not discerned" (Wisd. 1:4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:18. Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.</body></html>
