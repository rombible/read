This may certainly denote pride (<span class="accented">qui se jactat et dilatat</span>, Vulgate), in which case the gnome says that one who thinks much of himself and despises others is the cause of quarrels and dissensions, occasioned by his struggles for pre-eminence and the ill feeling arising from his overbearing and supercilious conduct. Others, and rightly, take the wide soul to denote covetousness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-2.htm">Proverbs 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>). It is the man of insatiable desire, the grasping avaricious man, who excites quarrels and mars all peace, and in the end destroys himself. "Whence come wars," asks St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1</a>), "and whence come fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members?

The character here opposed to the covetous is that of the patient. God-fearing man, who is contented to do his duty, and leave the result in the Lord's hands. This man shall be made fat, shall be comforted and largely blessed, while he who puts his hope in material things shall fall into calamity. Septuagint, "He who trusts in the Lord will be in his care (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:24. Here is the wickedness of those who think it no sin to rob their parents, by wheedling them or threatening them, or by wasting what they have, and running into debt. 25. Those make themselves always easy, that live in continual dependence upon God and his grace, and live by faith. 26. A fool trusts to his own strength, merit, and righteousness. And trusts to his own heart, which is not only deceitful above all things, but which has often deceived him. 27. A selfish man not only will not look out for objects of compassion, but will look off from those that call for his attention. 28. When power is put into the hands of the wicked, wise men decline public business. If the reader will go diligently over this and the other chapters, in many places where at first he may suppose there is least of Christ, still he will find what will lead to him.</body></html>
