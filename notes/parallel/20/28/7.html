"Law" is <span class="accented">torah</span>, as ver. 4; but it seems here to include not only the Decalogue, but also the father's instruction and commands. Such an obedient and prudent son brings honour and joy to a parent's heart (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-3.htm">Proverbs 29:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he</span> <span class="accented">that feedeth</span>, <span class="accented">hath fellowship with</span>, <span class="accented">gluttons</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-20.htm">Proverbs 23:20</a>). The son who herds with debauchers, and wastes his substance in riotous living, brings shame on, wounds, and insults, all connected with him. Such a one transgresses the Law and his father's commands, and brings them into contempt (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-11.htm">Proverbs 27:11</a>). Hence the antithesis of the two clauses. Septuagint, "He that cherishes debauchery (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) dishonours his father." <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs only in 2 Macc. 6:4, but is common in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1 Sin makes men cowards. Whatever difficulties the righteous meet in the way of duty, they are not daunted. 2. National sins disturb the public repose. 3. If needy persons get opportunities of oppressing, their extortion will be more severe than that of the more wealthy. 4. Wicked people strengthen one another in wicked ways. 5. If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more. 6. An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man; has more comfort in himself, and is a greater blessing to the world. 7. Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them. 8. That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified. 9. The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 10. The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 11. Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 12. There is glory in the land when the righteous have liberty. 13. It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 14. There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 15. A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 16. Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 17. The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.</body></html>
