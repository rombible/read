"Faithful," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-6.htm">Proverbs 20:6</a>, one on whom one can depend, honest and upright. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The blessings signified are such as come from God and man. Men will utter his name with praise and benediction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-8.htm">Job 29:8</a>, etc.), and God will show his approval by sending material prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent</span> (comp. ver. 22, and note there; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-11.htm">Proverbs 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-21.htm">Proverbs 20:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>). One who is only anxious to become quickly rich, and is unscrupulous as to means, cannot be "a faithful man," and therefore cannot be blessed. Instead of "innocent," many expositors render "unpunished" (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>), which better contrasts with the blessings mentioned in the first hemistich, though the two ideas are coordinate. On this haste of covetousness, Juvenal writes ('Sat.,' 14:173) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Inde fere scelerum causae; nec plura venena<br />Miscuit aut ferro grassatur saepius ullum<br />Humanae mentis vitium, quam saeva cupido<br />Immodici census; nam dives qui fieri vult,<br />Et cito vult fieri. Sed quae reverentia legum,<br />Quis metus aut pudor est unquam properantis avari?"</span> The Septuagint waters down the gnome, "But the wicked shall not be unpunished." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:18. Uprightness will give men holy security in the worst times; but the false and dishonest are never safe. 19. Those who are diligent, take the way to live comfortably. 20. The true way to be happy, is to be holy and honest; not to raise an estate suddenly, without regard to right or wrong. 21. Judgment is perverted, when any thing but pure right is considered. 22. He that hastens to be rich, never seriously thinks how quickly God may take his wealth from him, and leave him in poverty. 23. Upon reflection, most will have a better opinion of a faithful reprover than of a soothing flatterer.</body></html>
