a man who does this is never free from a burden of guilt, as the psalmist says, "When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.</span> Confession alone without amendment, or what is called theologically satisfaction, does not win pardon and mercy. It is when the sinner acknowledges his transgression, and turns from it to newness of life, that God heals his backsliding, and turns away his auger and renews the tokens of his love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a>). Confession is made to God, against whom all sin is committed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-33.htm">Job 31:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>, etc.): and to man, if one has transgressed against him, or if he be in a position to give spiritual counsel. Thus the people confessed their sins before John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>) and the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-18.htm">Acts 19:18</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). Among the Jews, the high priest, acting as the mouthpiece of the people on the great Day of Atonement, confessed their iniquities, laying them on the scapegoat; and particular confession was also enjoined, and was part of the ritual accompanying a sacrifice for sin, by which legal purification was obtained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-6.htm">Numbers 5:6, 7</a>, "When a man or woman shall commit any sin... then they shall confess their sin which they have done;" so <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a>). And the very offering of a trespass offering was a public recognition of guilt, which was exhibited by the offerer laying his hand on the head of the victim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>). Such confession is spoken of strongly by Siracides, "Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, and force not the course of the river" (Ecclus. 4:26); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. do not attempt the impossible task of trying to hide them.

Whatever difficulties the righteous meet in the way of duty, they are not daunted. 2. National sins disturb the public repose. 3. If needy persons get opportunities of oppressing, their extortion will be more severe than that of the more wealthy. 4. Wicked people strengthen one another in wicked ways. 5. If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more. 6. An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man; has more comfort in himself, and is a greater blessing to the world. 7. Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them. 8. That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified. 9. The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 10. The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 11. Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 12. There is glory in the land when the righteous have liberty. 13. It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 14. There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 15. A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 16. Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 17. The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.</body></html>
