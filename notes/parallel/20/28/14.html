Thus Aben Ezra. But it is rather the fear of sin which is meant - that tender conscience and watchful heart which lead a man robe prepared for temptation and able to resist it when it arises. Such a one distrusts himself, takes heed lest he fall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>), and works out his salvation with fear and trembling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>). "Grow not thoughtless of retribution" ('Pirke Aboth,' 1:8). A horror of sin cannot be instilled too early into the young. Septuagint, "Happy is the man who piously (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) fears all things." St. Bernard ('In Cant. Serm.,' 54:9)," In veritate didici, nil aeque efficax esse ad gratiam promerendam, retinendam, recuperandam, quam si omni tempore coram Deo inveniaris non altum sapere, sed timere. Time ergo cum arriserit gratia, time cum abierit, time cum denuo revertetur; et hoc est semper pavidum esse." <span class="cmt_word">He that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief;</span> or, <span class="accented">calamity</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>). A man hardens his heart who attends not to the voice of conscience, the restraints of religion, the counsel of friends, the warnings of experience (comp. ver. 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>). This man scorns the grace of God, loses his protection, and must come to misery. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1 Sin makes men cowards. Whatever difficulties the righteous meet in the way of duty, they are not daunted. 2. National sins disturb the public repose. 3. If needy persons get opportunities of oppressing, their extortion will be more severe than that of the more wealthy. 4. Wicked people strengthen one another in wicked ways. 5. If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more. 6. An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man; has more comfort in himself, and is a greater blessing to the world. 7. Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them. 8. That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified. 9. The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 10. The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 11. Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 12. There is glory in the land when the righteous have liberty. 13. It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 14. There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 15. A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 16. Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 17. The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.</body></html>
