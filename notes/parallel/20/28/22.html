The man of evil eye (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>) is the envious and covetous man; such a one tries to improve his position and raise himself speedily to the height of him whom he envies, and is quite unscrupulous as to the means which he uses to effect his purpose, and keeps all that he gains selfishly to himself. And yet he is really blind to his own best interests (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-21.htm">Proverbs 20:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And considereth not that poverty shall come upon him</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4, 5</a>). His grasping greed brings no blessing with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>), excites others to defraud him, and in the end consigns him to merited poverty. The LXX. here reads somewhat differently, and translates, "An envious man hasteth to be rich, and knows not that the merciful man (<span class="accented">chasid</span> instead of <span class="accented">cheser</span>) will I,ave the mastery over him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will take his wealth, as ver. 8. Proverbs concerning hastily gotten wealth have already been given. Here are a few more: Spanish, "Who would be rich in a year gets hanged in half a year;" Italian, "The river does not become swollen with clear water;" says a Scotch proverb, "Better a wee fire to warm as than a meikle fire to burn us." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:18. Uprightness will give men holy security in the worst times; but the false and dishonest are never safe. 19. Those who are diligent, take the way to live comfortably. 20. The true way to be happy, is to be holy and honest; not to raise an estate suddenly, without regard to right or wrong. 21. Judgment is perverted, when any thing but pure right is considered. 22. He that hastens to be rich, never seriously thinks how quickly God may take his wealth from him, and leave him in poverty. 23. Upon reflection, most will have a better opinion of a faithful reprover than of a soothing flatterer.</body></html>
