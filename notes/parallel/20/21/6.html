The latter clause is variously rendered and interpreted. The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">a fleeting breath, those seeking death.</span> The Revised Version makes the last words a separate proposition, "They that seek them seek death." But this seems unnecessary, and somewhat opposed to the gnomic style, which often combines two predicates in one construction; and there is no reason why we should not render the words, as in the Authorized Version, "of seekers of death." Such a mode of obtaining wealth is as evanescent and unstable as the very breath, and ends in death, which is practically the result of their quest. Thus Wisd. 5:14, "The hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with the tempest, and passeth away. as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day." Some think that the comparison regards the mirage of the desert, which deceives travellers with the phantasms of cool waters and refreshing shade. Such an allusion is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>. The Talmud enjoins, "Speak no word that accords not with the truth, that thy honour may not vanish as the waters of a brook." The Septuagint and Vulgate have followed a different reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>), and render thus: Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vanus et excors est, et impingetur ad laqueos mortis</span>, "He is vain and foolish, and will be taken in the snares of death;" Septuagint, "pursues vain things unto the snares of death (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). So St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that desire to be rich fall into a into a temptation and a snare (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>), and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1 The believer, perceiving that the Lord rules every heart as he sees fit, like the husbandman who turns the water through his grounds as he pleases, seeks to have his own heart, and the hearts of others, directed in his faith, fear, and love. 2. We are partial in judging ourselves and our actions. 3. Many deceive themselves with a conceit that outward devotions will excuse unrighteousness. 4. Sin is the pride, the ambition, the glory, the joy, and the business of wicked men. 5. The really diligent employ foresight as well as labour. 6. While men seek wealth by unlawful practices, they seek death. 7. Injustice will return upon the sinner, and will destroy him here and for ever. 8. The way of mankind by nature is froward and strange.</body></html>
