But it is best to make the whole verse one idea, as in the Authorized Version. The lifting of the eyes is a term implying pride, as shown in supercilious looks, as if other people were of inferior clay and not worthy of notice. So we have "haughty eyes" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a> (where see note); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a> we read, "There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up." "The enlargement of the heart" is the cause of the proud look, for it signifies the evil affections and concupiscence of the will, wholly filled up with self, and controlling the actions and expression of the body. Septuagint, "A high-minded man (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is stout-hearted in his pride." <span class="cmt_word">And the ploughing of the wicked is sin.</span> The Authorized Version takes the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nir</span>), which means "tillage' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>), or, as Delitzsch supposes, "land ploughed for the first time" (<span class="accented">novale</span>). The proverb, taken thus, will mean, "high look, proud heart, even all the field which the godless cultivate, all that they do, is sin." "Pride," says the Talmud, "is worse than sin." But another pointing gives a different and very appropriate (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-20.htm">Proverbs 24:20</a>) meaning. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">ner</span>) signifies "a lamp." Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Lucerna impiorum peccatum</span>, "The lamp of the wicked is sin;" and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "Lamp" is, as often, a metaphor for prosperity and happiness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-29.htm">2 Samuel 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>); and it is here said that the sinner's outward prosperity and joyousness, springing from no good source, being founded in self, and not resting on virtue and godliness, are in themselves sinful and displeasing to God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1 The believer, perceiving that the Lord rules every heart as he sees fit, like the husbandman who turns the water through his grounds as he pleases, seeks to have his own heart, and the hearts of others, directed in his faith, fear, and love. 2. We are partial in judging ourselves and our actions. 3. Many deceive themselves with a conceit that outward devotions will excuse unrighteousness. 4. Sin is the pride, the ambition, the glory, the joy, and the business of wicked men. 5. The really diligent employ foresight as well as labour. 6. While men seek wealth by unlawful practices, they seek death. 7. Injustice will return upon the sinner, and will destroy him here and for ever. 8. The way of mankind by nature is froward and strange.</body></html>
