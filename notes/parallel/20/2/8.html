The word "saint" rather implies dedication to God, as Israel was a "holy nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>) to God, and Christians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>) are now in the same position. The term <span class= "ital">ch?sid, </span>at the time of the Maccabees, was assumed by such "as were voluntarily devoted to the law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-42.htm" title="Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law.">1 Maccabees 2:42</a>), in opposition to those who favoured the Greek religion and culture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He keepeth the paths of judgment.</span> This verse is explanatory of the latter hemistich of ver. 7, and points out more fully in what way God is a Protector of his saints. Some connect the Hebrew infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">lin'tsor</span>), "to watch or keep," with "them that walk uprightly," and translate, "them that walk uprightly by keeping the paths of judgment;" but this is to transfer the idea of protection from God to such persons. The verb signifies specially "to defend, to preserve from danger," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>, "The eyes of the Lind preserve knowledge; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> defend or protect it from danger." It is God who "keepeth the paths of judgment," as he alone has the power to do so. He watches over all that walk therein, guides, superin. tends, and protects them. <span class="accented">The paths of judgment</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">justice</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">at'khoth mishpat</span>). The abstract is here used for the concrete, and the phrase means "the paths of the just," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the paths in which the just walk, or "those who walk justly" (Mercerus). This expression corresponds with "the way of his saints," just as "keep" and "preserve" are synonymous verbs, both meaning "to guard, keep safe, or protect." <span class="cmt_word">He preserveth the way of his saints.</span> God does this <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by his preventing grace, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>, "He suffereth not our feet to slip." Cf. Hannah's song, "He will keep the feet of his saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by angelic agency, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, "He shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways." The saints are ever under the watchful care and mighty protection of Jehovah. <span class="accented">His saints</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">khasidav</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the pious towards God, the godly, those in whose hearts the principles of sanctity have been implanted, and who cherish earnest inward love to God, and "walk righteously" and "speak uprightly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). It is remarkable that the word saints only occurs once (in this passage) in the Proverbs. During the period of the Maccabaean Wars, a party or sect, which aimed at ceremonial purity, claimed for themselves the title of <span class="accented">Chasidim</span> or <span class="accented">Asidaeans</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), as expressive of their piety or devotion. They are those whom Moses called "men of holiness," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">v'an'shev-kodesh</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-5.htm">Psalm 89:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Deuteronomy 33:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm">Daniel 7:18, 22, 22, 25</a>. Under the Christian dispensation, the saints are those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>), and who are holy in all manner of conversation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a>; 1 Macc. 2:42 1 Macc. 7:13; 2 Macc. 14:6); see Bishop Lightfoot, 'Colossians and Philemon,' diss. 2, p. 355. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that they have lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do away the necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27. Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to him for wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.</body></html>
