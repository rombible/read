The word is rendered as "friend" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>. The idea of guidance, which is adopted in the Authorized Version, and appears also in the Vulgate <span class="accented">dux.</span> and Targum <span class="accented">ducatus</span>, is a secondary idea, and is derived probably from the relation in which the husband stands to his wife. Various interpretations have been given to the expression. It occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>, where Jehovah applies it to himself, and says, through his prophet, to the religiously adulterous Judah, "Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the Guide of my youth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">alluph n'ura</span>)?" It has also been understood as referring to the woman's parents, her father and mother, who were her natural guardians. But the context seems to require that it should be taken as designating her <span class="accented">husband.</span> It will then be the correlative of "the wife of thy youth" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The covenant of her God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the marriage covenant, called "the covenant of her God," because entered into in his presence. The forsaking of the guide of her youth is essentially bound up with a forgetfulness of the solemn covenant which she had entered into in the presence of God. No specific mention is made in the Pentateuch of any religious ceremony at marriage; yet we may infer, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14, 15</a>, where God is spoken of as "a Witness" between the husband and "the wife of his youth," "the wife of thy covenant," that the marriage contract was solemnized with sacred rites. The Proverbs thus give a high and sacred character to marriage, and so carry on the original idea of the institution which, under the gospel dispensation, developed late the principle of the indissolubility of the marriage tie. It is no objection to this view that the monogamic principle was infringed, and polygamy countenanced. The reason of this latter departure is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16</a>. The morality of the Proverbs always represents monogamy as the rule, it deprecates illicit intercourse, and discountenances divorce. It is in entire accordance with the seventh commandment. The woman who commits adultery offends, not only against her husband, but against her God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 If we are truly wise, we shall be careful to avoid all evil company and evil practices. When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?</body></html>
