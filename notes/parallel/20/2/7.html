The teacher passes to another phase of the Divine character. God is not only the Source of wisdom; he is also the Ensurer of safety, the Source of salvation to those who act uprightly. It will be noted that the use of the word is confined to the Proverbs and Job, with the exception of the two passages in Isaiah and Micah. <span class="cmt_word">Buckler</span>. Besides storing up the treasures of sound wisdom, which the righteous may use and so obtain security in their uprightness, God is himself a <span class="accented">Buckler</span>, or <span class="accented">Shield</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">magen</span>), to those who walk in innocence. This aspect of God's directly protecting power is met with in other parts of Scripture. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a> he encourages Abram with the assurance, "I am thy Shield." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>, Jehovah is called a Shield to his saints. He renders them security against the assaults of their enemies, and especially against the fiery darts of the wicked one. Again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>, it is said, "God is a Shield (<span class="accented">magen</span>) up to them that walk uprightly." It is incorrect to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">magen</span>) either as an accusative after the verb or in apposition with "sound wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">To them that walk uprightly;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to the walkers in innocence</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">l'khol'key thom</span>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">thom</span>) is "integrity of mind," "moral faultlessness," "innocence." "To walk uprightly" is to maintain a course of life regulated by right principles, and directed to right ends. He "walks uprightly who lives with the fear of God as his principle, the Word of God as his rule, and the glory of God as his end" (Wardlaw). The <span class="accented">completeness</span> of the moral and religious character is involved in the expression which is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>. The Vulgate translates the latter clause of the verse, <span class="accented">proteget gradientes simpliciter</span>, "he will protect those who walk in simplicity;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a> in illustration of the phrase. <span class="cmt_word">He layeth up;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he treasures up (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), or preserves and protects (<span class="accented">custodire</span>, Vulgate), as a person does "treasure or jewel, that it may not be stolen" (Zockler). The majority of commentators read the Keri (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>, "he will treasure up," future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) in preference to the Khetib (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, perfect of same verb, with prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;</span>, "and he treasured up"), and this is the; reading adopted in the Authorized Version. The Keri implies that God does treasure up sound wisdom, while the Khetib, as Delitzsch observes, has the force of the aorist, and so represents the treasuring up as an accomplished fact. The same verb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>, where it is translated in the Authorized Version by "hide," and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a> and Proverbs 10:14 by "lay up." The laying up, or treasuring, points to the preciousness of that which is treasured, "sound wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">Sound wisdom</span>. A great variety of opinions exists as to the true meaning of the word in the original, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tvushiyyah</span>), of which "sound wisdom" is an interpretation. Zockler explains it as "wisdom, reflection;" Delitzsch, as "advancement and promotion;" Dathe, as "solid fortune;" Gesenius, as "aid." The proper meaning of the word seems to he "substance," from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to be, to exist, to be firm." Professor Lee remarks on the word, "From the places in which it occurs, either wealth, thought, or some such sense it manifestly requires. It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13</a>, in parallelism with 'help;' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>, with a 'shield;' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, with 'wisdom;' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-16.htm">Job 12:16</a>, with 'strength;' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21</a>, with 'discretion;' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>, with 'counsel' and 'understanding;' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>, with 'counsel;' and so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>, 'entirely' or the like seems to suit the context; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a>, and generally 'excess,' or 'abundance,' taken either in a good or bad sense, and varied by other considerations, seems to prevail in every case in which this word is used" (see Professor Lee, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>). The parallelism of the passage before us seems to require that it should be understood in the sense of <span class="accented">security</span>; and transferring the idea to wisdom as the means of security. This idea is reproduced in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">salus</span>, and the Targum <span class="accented">incolumitas.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that they have lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do away the necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27. Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to him for wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.</body></html>
