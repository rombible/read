As the former referred to God, so this appears to refer more especially to man, and thus we have stated the whole benefit, in its twofold aspect, which Wisdom confers on those who diligently seek her. It is not to be affirmed, however, that righteousness and judgment and equity refer exclusively to man; they must represent some aspects of our relationship to God, both from the meaning of the words themselves, and because the law which regulates our dealings and intercourse with man has its seat in the higher law of our relation to God. <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness, and judgment, and equity.</span> These three words occur in the same collocation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>, which see. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, every good path.</span> "Yea" does not occur in the original. The expression is a summarizing of the three previous conceptions, as if the teacher implied that all good paths are embraced by and included in "righteousness, and judgment, and equity;" but the term is also comprehensive in the widest degree. The literal translation is "every path of good" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">cal-ma'gal-tov</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> every course of action of which goodness is the characteristic, or, as the Authorized Version, "every good path," the sense in which it was understood by St. Jerome, <span class="accented">omnem orbitam bonam.</span> The word here used for "path" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">ma'gal</span>), "the way in which the chariot rolls" (Delitzsch), and metaphorically a course of action, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that they have lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do away the necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27. Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to him for wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.</body></html>
