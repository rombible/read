It was to bestow this knowledge upon man that Christ came into the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>). He promises (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-21.htm" title="He that despises his neighbor sins: but he that has mercy on the poor, happy is he.">Proverbs 14:21</a>) the manifestation of Himself as the reward of obedience and love. And yet our highest knowledge of God in this life must be so imperfect, in comparison with the knowledge of Him hereafter, when we shall see Him "face to face" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>), that St. Paul.

The earnest endeavour after Wisdom meets with its reward, and those that seek shall find (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>): and thus an inducement is held forth to listen to the admonition of the teacher. <span class="accented">Understand</span> implies the power of discernment, but Zockler gives it the further moaning of taking to one's self as a spiritual possession, just as "find" meaning primarily "to arrive at" conveys the idea of getting possession of (Mercerus). <span class="accented">The fear of the Lord</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">yir'ath y'hovah</span>); "the fear of Jehovah," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>. As it is the beginning, so it is the highest form of knowledge and the greatest good. Elsewhere it is represented as a fountain of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>). All true wisdom is summed up in "the fear of the Lord." It here means the reverence due to him, and so comprises the whole range of the religious affections and feelings, which respond to various attributes of the Divine character as they are revealed, and which find their expression in holy worship. <span class="cmt_word">The knowledge of God</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">daath Elohim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the knowledge of Elohim.</span> Not merely cognition, but knowledge in its wider sense. The two ideas of "the fear of the Lord" and "the knowledge of God" act reciprocally on each other. Just as without reverence of God there can be no knowledge of him in its true sense, so the knowledge of God will increase and deepen the feeling of reverence. But it is noticeable that the teacher here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, where, however, it is "the knowledge of the holy" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">daath k'doshim</span>), gives the chief place to reverence, and thus indicates that it is the basis of knowledge, which is its fruit and result. The relation here suggested is analogous to that which subsists between faith and knowledge, and recalls the celebrated dictum of Anselm: "Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam; sed credo, ut intelligam." <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, here interchanged with <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, is not of frequent occurrence in the Proverbs, as it is only found therein five times, while the predominating word which is used to designate the Deity is <span class="accented">Jehovah.</span> But it is difficult to draw any distinction between them here. <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> may refer more especially to the Personality of the Divine nature, while <span class="accented">Elohim</span> may refer to Christ's glory (Plumptre). Bishop Wordsworth thinks that a distinction is made between the knowledge of Elohim and the knowledge of man which is of little worth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that they have lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do away the necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27. Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to him for wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.</body></html>
