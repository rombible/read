The truth stated here is also met with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, "He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding." He "giveth," or more properly, "will give" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">yitten</span>, future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">nathan</span>), wisdom; but the connection requires us to understand that the assurance applies only to those who seek after it earnestly and truly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5-7</a>). The two coefficients to our obtaining wisdom are our efforts and God's assistance. Solomon may be adduced as s striking exemplification of this; he asked for "an understanding heart," and God graciously granted his request (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of his mouth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">mippiv</span>); <span class="accented">ex ore ejus</span>; God is here spoken of anthropologically. He is the true Teacher. The meaning is that God communicates wisdom through the medium of his Word (Delitzsch. Pi.). The law proceeds from his mouth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-22.htm">Job 22:22</a>). In the Book of Wisdom (7:25), "Wisdom is the breath of the power of God." His word is conveyed to us through men divinely inspired, and hence St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>) says that "holy men of old spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that they have lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do away the necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27. Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to him for wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.</body></html>
