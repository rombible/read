The teacher has already Warned youth against the temptations and dangers of the way of evil men in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-15</a>; he now shows that discretion, arising from wisdom being resident in the heart, will be a sufficient safeguard against its allurements. <span class="cmt_word">From the man that speaketh froward things.</span> Perverse utterances are here brought in contradistinction to the evil way or froward conduct. <span class="accented">Man</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> <span class="accented">ish</span>) is here used generically, as the representative of the whole class of base and wicked men, since all the following verbs are in the plural, <span class="accented">Froward things.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">tah'pucoth</span>), here translated "froward things," is derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">haphak</span>), "to turn," "to pervert," and should be translated "perverseness." Perverseness is the wilful misrepresentation of that which is good and true. The utterances are of a distorted and tortuous character. The word, only found in the plural, is abstract in form, and is of frequent, though not of exclusive, occurrence in the Proverbs. It is attributed to the Israelites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>. It is met with again in such expressions as "the mouth of perverseness," Authorized Version "froward mouth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>); "the tongue of perverseness," "froward tongue," Authorized Version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>); "the man of perverseness," "froward man," Authorized Version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>). What is here said of wicked men is attributed to drunkards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-33.htm">Proverbs 23:33</a>, "Thine heart shall utter perverse things." The expression finds its explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13, 14</a>. The spirit which indulges in this perverseness is stubborn, scornful, self-willed, and rebellious, and it is from such a spirit that discretion is a preservative. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a> it is said that "the counsel of the froward is carried headlong" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-27.htm">2 Samuel 22:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-4.htm">Psalm 101:4</a>). The LXX. rendering of this word is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "nothing trustworthy," which is amplified in the Arabic, <span class="accented">quod nullam in se continet veritatem</span>, "that which contains in itself no truth." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 If we are truly wise, we shall be careful to avoid all evil company and evil practices. When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?</body></html>
