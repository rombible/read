It is the secure and peaceful dwelling in the land which is intended (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-30.htm">Proverbs 10:30</a>). To dwell in the land was always put forward as the reward of obedience to God's commandments (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-18.htm">Leviticus 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>), and the phrase conveyed to the Hebrew mind the idea of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of all temporal blessings. The love of country was a predominant characteristic of the race. Elster, quoted by Zockler, remarks, "The Israelite was beyond the power of natural feeling, which makes home dear to every one, more closely bound to the ancestral soil by the whole form of the theocracy; torn kern it, he was in the inmost roots of life strained and broken. Especially from psalms belonging to the period of the exile this patriotic feeling is breathed out in the fullest glow and intensity." <span class="accented">The land</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> <span class="accented">arets</span>) was the promised land, the land of Canaan. The word is not used here in the wider sense in which it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth." <span class="cmt_word">And the perfect shall remain in it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they shall not, as Rabbi Levi remarks, be driven thence nor caused to migrate.

LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> "shall remain;" <span class="accented">permanebunt</span>, Vulgate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 If we are truly wise, we shall be careful to avoid all evil company and evil practices. When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?</body></html>
