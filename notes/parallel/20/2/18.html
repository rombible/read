The objection to the Authorized Version is that it does not tbllow the construction of the original, the verb "sinks down" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">shakhah</span>) being feminine, while "house" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">bayith</span>) is invariably masculine. Aben Ezra translates, "She sinks down to death, (which is to be) her house;" but it seems better to regard "her house" as an adjunct of the strange woman. Her house includes all who belong to her. She and they are involved in the same fate. The Authorized Version is evidently influenced by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Inclinata est enim ad mortem domus ejus</span>, "For her house is inclined to death." The LXX. gives a different rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For she hath placed her house beside death." So the Arabic. The "for" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">ki</span>) refers back to ver. 16, and indicates how great is the deliverance effected by wisdom. The meaning of the passage is aptly illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>, "Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death." <span class="cmt_word">And her paths unto the dead.</span> <span class="accented">The dead</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">r'phaim</span>) are properly the quiet, or the feeble. They are the shadowy inhabitants or shades of Hades, the <span class="accented">inferi</span> of the Vulgate, and are here put for Sheol itself. Compare the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of Homer, and the <span class="accented">umbrae</span>, "shades," of Virgil. The word occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-16.htm">Proverbs 21:16</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-5.htm">Job 26:5</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 If we are truly wise, we shall be careful to avoid all evil company and evil practices. When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?</body></html>
