It seems clear that it is no longer Wisdom personified who is the speaker, from the fact that the words, "wisdom and understanding" in ver. 2 are used without the possessive pronoun "my," which would have been undoubtedly inserted if this address had been a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter. Some of the ideas of that address, however, are restated, as the crying and lifting up the voice after Wisdom, and the conclusion, wherein the respective destinies of the pious and wicked are portrayed. The particle "if" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>) is conditional, and serves to introduce the series of clauses (vers. 1-4) which lay down the conditions upon which the promises depend, and which form the protasis to the double apodosis in vers. 5 and 9. De Wette, Meyer, and Delitzsch regard it as voluntative, as expressing a wish on the part of the teacher, and translate, "Oh that thou wouldst!" and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, "if," is used in this way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-19.htm">Psalm 139:19</a>; but the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>) and Vulgate (<span class="accented">si</span>) make it conditional. It is repeated in an emphatic form in ver. 3. <span class="cmt_word">Receive</span>. The verbs "receive" and "hide" show that the endeavour after Wisdom is to be candid and sincere. "To receive" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) seems to be here used, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the sense of "to receive graciously," "to admit the words of Wisdom." It is noticeable that there is a gradation in emphasis in the various terms here used by the teacher. Just as "commandments" is stronger than "words," so "hide" is stronger than "receive." The emphasizing is carried on in the following verses in the same way, and at length culminates in ver. 4, which sums up the ardent spirit in which the search after Wisdom is to be prosecuted in presenting it to us in its strongest form. <span class="cmt_word">Hide</span>. The original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">tsaphan</span>) is here used in a different sense to that in which it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a> and 18. It here refers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>; and Proverbs 13:22, to the storing or laying up, as of treasure, in some secret repository, and means "to lay up." The Divine commands of the teacher are to be hidden in safe custody in the memory, in the understanding, in the conscience, and in the heart (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>). The psalmist expresses the same idea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, "Thy words have I <span class="accented">hid</span> in my heart, that I might not sin against thee." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that they have lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do away the necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27. Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to him for wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.</body></html>
