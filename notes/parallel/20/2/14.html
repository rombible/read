The wicked not only rejoice to do evil themselves, but they exult when they hear of evil in others (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>). Such may be the interpretation, though the latter part, of the verse is capable of a different and more general rendering as signifying exultation in evil generally, whether it appears in themselves or others. The expression rendered in the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">in the frowardness of the wicked,</span> is in the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> <span class="accented">b'thah'pucoth ra</span>), <span class="accented">in the perverseness of evil</span>, or in evil perverseness, where the combination of the two nouns serves to give force to the main idea, which is that of perverseness. This rendering is adopted in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in evil distortion;" in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in pessimis rebus</span>; in the Targum, Syriac, and Arabic, <span class="accented">in conversatione mala</span>, "in a bad course of conduct;" and in the Targum, <span class="accented">in malitiae perversione</span>, "in the perversion of wickedness." It is not perverseness in its simple and common form that these men exult in. but in its worst and most vicious form (for a similar construction, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>; and Proverbs 28:5). How widely different is the conduct of charity, which "rejoiceth not in iniquity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-6.htm">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>)! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 If we are truly wise, we shall be careful to avoid all evil company and evil practices. When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?</body></html>
