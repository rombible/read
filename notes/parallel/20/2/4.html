Rock inscriptions have been found near the former, dating from a great age, in the opinion of Lepsius from 4000 B.C. (See the article "Mines," in Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible; </span>comp. also the description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/28-1.htm" title="Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.">Job 28:1-11</a>.) Silver was brought to Solomon from Arabia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-14.htm" title="Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.">2Chronicles 9:14</a>) and Tarshish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-21.htm" title="For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">2Chronicles 9:21</a>), probably Tartessus, in Spain.<p><span class= "bld">Searchest for her as for hid treasures.</span>--From the great insecurity of life and property in Eastern countries, the hiding of treasures in the earth has always been of frequent occurrence. It would often, no doubt, happen that the owner would die without disclosing the place of concealment to any one else, and the treasure thus be lost. Hunting after such hoards has in consequence been always of the keenest interest to Orientals, and as such furnishes the groundwork for one of our Lord's parables (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-44.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to treasure hid in a field; the which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.">Matthew 13:44</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou seekest,</span> etc. The climax in the series of conditions is reached in this verse; and the imagery employed in both clauses indicates that the search after Wisdom is to be <span class="accented">persevering</span>, unrelaxing, and diligent, like the unremitting toil and labour with which men carry on mining operations. "To seek" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">bakash</span>) in the original is properly "to seek diligently" (piel), and is kindred to "to search" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>, <span class="accented">khaphas</span>), which again is equivalent to "to dig" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">khaphar</span>), the Vulgate <span class="accented">effodere</span>, "to dig out." Compare the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-21.htm">Job 3:21</a>, "And dig for it more than for hid treasures." We trace in these verbs the idea in the mind of the teacher indicated above, which finds expression also in the object of the search, the silver, in its crude state, and the hidden treasures (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">mat'monim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> the treasures of gold, silver, and precious metal concealed in the earth. The comparison here made between the search for Wisdom and the search for the hidden treasures of the earth was not unfamiliar to the Hebrew mind, as it is found worked out with great beauty of detail in the twenty-eighth chapter of Job. Again, the comparison of Wisdom with things most precious in the estimation of man is natural and common, and occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-72.htm">Psalm 119:72</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15-19</a>. The same ideas and comparisons here used are presented to us in the New Testament teaching, in our Lord's parable of the man who finds the hid treasure in the field, and, in the phraseology of St. Paul, who speaks of "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," and of "the unsearchable riches of Christ." "Divine knowledge is an inexhaustible mine of precious ore" (Wardlaw). The language of the Proverbs would receive additional three from the circumstances of the reign of Solomon, the most splendid and prosperous era in the annals of the Jewish national history, in the means taken to secure the treasures of other and distant countries; the wealth and the riches of that reign (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-22</a>) would help to bring out the idea of the superlative value of Wisdom. In no era of the Jewish national history was there such abundance of riches, such splendid prosperity, as in the reign of Solomon, whose ships of Tarshish brought "gold and silver" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-22</a>), and this state of things would give point to the comparisons which the teacher uses in our text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that they have lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do away the necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27. Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to him for wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.</body></html>
