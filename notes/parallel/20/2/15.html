Sinners, in their perverseness, are ever winding about, turning in every direction, and changing from purpose to purpose, as wayward caprice or shifting inclination, the alternations of evil propensity, happen to dictate (Wardlaw).

The niph. participle <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d6;</span> (<span class="accented">naloz</span>) only occurs four times in the Scriptures - here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-2.htm">Proverbs 14:2</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-12.htm">Isaiah 30:12</a>. This is the last feature in their wickedness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 If we are truly wise, we shall be careful to avoid all evil company and evil practices. When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?</body></html>
