The protecting power of wisdom is developed in a positive direction. Negatively, it delivers from the evil man and from the strange woman, but it does more - "it shall keep thee in order that thou mayest walk in a good way," etc. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">l'maan</span>) is coordinate with "to deliver thee," but it serves to bring the discourse to a conclusion. Umbreit renders it "therefore," thus making what follows an inference from the preceding discourse. So the Syriac, <span class="accented">ambula igitur</span>, "therefore walk." <span class="cmt_word">In the way of good men</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">b'derek tovim</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the way of the good, in an ethical sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the upright, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">in via bona</span>, "in the good way." "The way of good men" is the way of God's commandments, the way of obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Keep</span>. The Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shamar</span>) is here used in the sense of "to observe," "to attend to," but in a different sense from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-4.htm">Psalm 17:4</a>, "I have observed the ways of the violent man," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that I might avoid them. To keep the paths of the righteous is to carefully attend to the life of obedience which they follow. The LXX. closely connects this verse with the preceding, and renders, "For if they had walked in good ways, they would have found the paths of righteousness light." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 If we are truly wise, we shall be careful to avoid all evil company and evil practices. When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?</body></html>
