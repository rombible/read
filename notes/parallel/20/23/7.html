In the Authorized Version the word "heart" occurs twice in this verse, but the Hebrew words are different. The first is <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, "breath," equivalent to "mind;" the second is <span class="accented">leb</span>, "heart." The Vulgate paraphrases the clause, <span class="accented">Quoniam in similitudinem arioli et conjectoris, aestimat quod ignorat</span>, "For like a soothsayer or diviner he conjectures that of which he is ignorant." <span class="cmt_word">Eat and drink, saith he to thee.</span> He professes to make you welcome, and with seeming cordiality invites you to partake of the food upon his table. <span class="cmt_word">But his heart is not with thee.</span> He is not glad to see you enjoy yourself, and his pressing invitation is empty verbiage with no heart in it. The Septuagint, pointing differently, translates, "For as if one should swallow a hair, so he eats and drinks." The Greek translators take the gnome to apply to one who invites an envious man to his table, and finds him eating his food as if it disgusted him. They go on, "Bring him not in to thee, nor eat thy morsel with him; for (ver. 8) he will vomit it up, and outrage thy fair words." In agreement with the gnome above, we find in the Talmud, "My son, eat not the bread of the covetous, nor sit thou at his table. The bread of the covetous is only pain and anguish; the bread of the generous man is a source of health and joy." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-3 God's restraints of the appetite only say, Do thyself no harm. 4,5. Be not of those that will be rich. The things of this world are not happiness and a portion for a soul; those that hold them ever so fast, cannot hold them always, cannot hold them long. 6-8. Do not make thyself burdensome to any, especially those not sincere. When we are called by God to his feast, and to let our souls delight themselves, Isa 25:6; 55:2, we may safely partake of the Bread of life. 9. It is our duty to take all fit occasions to speak of Divine things; but if what a wise man says will not be heard, let him hold his peace. 10,11. The fatherless are taken under God's special protection. He is their Redeemer, who will take their part; and he is mighty, almighty.</body></html>
