Premature death was regarded as a punishment of sin, as long life was the reward of righteousness. Proper discipline preserves a youth not only from many material dangers incident to unbridled passions, but saves him from spiritual death, the decay and destruction of grace here, and the retribution that awaits the sinner in another world (comp.

The believer's expectation shall not be disappointed; the end of his trials, and of the sinner's prosperity, is at hand.</body></html>
