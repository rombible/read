Ecclus. 21:2). <span class="accented">Nachash</span> is the generic name for any of the larger tribe of snakes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, etc.); the poisonous nature of its bite was, of course, well known (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stingeth like an adder.</span> The Hebrew word is <span class="accented">tsiphoni</span>, which is usually rendered "cockatrice" in the Authorized Version, but the particular species intended has not been accurately identified. There was some confusion in men's minds as to the organ which inflicted the poisonous wound. Thus a psalmist says, "They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-3.htm">Psalm 140:3</a>). But the verb "sting" is to be taken in the sense of puncturing, making a wound. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sicut regulus venena diffundet</span>, "It will diffuse its poison like a basilisk:" Septuagint, "But at the last he stretches himself like one stricken by a serpent, and the venom is diffused through him as by a horned snake (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:29-35 Solomon warns against drunkenness. Those that would be kept from sin, must keep from all the beginnings of it, and fear coming within reach of its allurements. Foresee the punishment, what it will at last end in, if repentance prevent not. It makes men quarrel. Drunkards wilfully make woe and sorrow for themselves. It makes men impure and insolent. The tongue grows unruly; the heart utters things contrary to reason, religion, and common civility. It stupifies and besots men. They are in danger of death, of damnation; as much exposed as if they slept upon the top of a mast, yet feel secure. They fear no peril when the terrors of the Lord are before them; they feel no pain when the judgments of God are actually upon them. So lost is a drunkard to virtue and honour, so wretchedly is his conscience seared, that he is not ashamed to say, I will seek it again. With good reason we were bid to stop before the beginning. Who that has common sense would contract a habit, or sell himself to a sin, which tends to such guilt and misery, and exposes a man every day to the danger of dying insensible, and awaking in hell? Wisdom seems in these chapters to take up the discourse as at the beginning of the book. They must be considered as the words of Christ to the sinner.</body></html>
