The wine of Palestine was chiefly "red," though what we call white wine was not unknown. The Vulgate <span class="accented">flavescit</span> points to the latter. <span class="cmt_word">When it giveth his colour in the cup.</span> For "color" the Hebrew has "eye," which refers to the sparkling and gleaming which show themselves in wine poured into the cup. It is as though the cup had an eye which glanced at the drinker with a fascination which he did not resist. <span class="cmt_word">When it moveth itself aright.</span> Having warned against the attraction of sight, the moralist now passes to the seduction of taste. Hebrew, <span class="accented">when it goeth by the right read.</span> This may refer to its transference from the jar or skin to the drinking cup; but it mere probably alludes to the drinker's throat, and is best translated, "when it glideth down smoothly." Vulgate, <span class="accented">ingreditur blande.</span> The wine pleases the palate, and passes over it without roughness or harshness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-9.htm">Song of Solomon 7:9</a>). The LXX. has enlarged on the original thus: "Be ye not drunk with wine, but converse with just men, and converse in public places (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). For if thou set thine eyes on goblets and cups, afterwards thou shalt walk more bare than a pestle (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." This last expression, <span class="accented">pistillo nudior</span>, is a proverb. Regarding the danger of looking on seductive objects, the Arab, in his sententious language, says, "The contemplation of vice is vice." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:29-35 Solomon warns against drunkenness. Those that would be kept from sin, must keep from all the beginnings of it, and fear coming within reach of its allurements. Foresee the punishment, what it will at last end in, if repentance prevent not. It makes men quarrel. Drunkards wilfully make woe and sorrow for themselves. It makes men impure and insolent. The tongue grows unruly; the heart utters things contrary to reason, religion, and common civility. It stupifies and besots men. They are in danger of death, of damnation; as much exposed as if they slept upon the top of a mast, yet feel secure. They fear no peril when the terrors of the Lord are before them; they feel no pain when the judgments of God are actually upon them. So lost is a drunkard to virtue and honour, so wretchedly is his conscience seared, that he is not ashamed to say, I will seek it again. With good reason we were bid to stop before the beginning. Who that has common sense would contract a habit, or sell himself to a sin, which tends to such guilt and misery, and exposes a man every day to the danger of dying insensible, and awaking in hell? Wisdom seems in these chapters to take up the discourse as at the beginning of the book. They must be considered as the words of Christ to the sinner.</body></html>
