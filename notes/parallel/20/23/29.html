The Vulgate has stumbled at the second expression, which is an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and resolving it into two words, translates, <span class="accented">Cujus patri vae</span>? <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Contentions</span>; the brawling and strife to which drunkenness leads (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Babbling</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span> (<span class="accented">siach</span>) is rather "meditation," "sorrowful thought" showing itself in complaining, regret for lost fortune, ruined health, alienated friends. Others render "misery,....penury." St. Jerome's <span class="accented">foveae</span> is derived from a different reading. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "lawsuits," <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "disgust and gossipings." <span class="cmt_word">Wounds without cause;</span> wounds which might have been avoided, the result of quarrels in which a sober man would never have engaged, <span class="cmt_word">Redness of eyes.</span> The Hebrew word <span class="accented">chakIi-luth</span> is commonly taken to mean the flashing of eyes occasioned by vinous excitement. The Authorized Version refers it to the bloodshot appearance of a drunkard's eyes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-12.htm">Genesis 49:12</a>, according to the same version. but Delitzsch, Nowack, and many modern commentators consider that the word indicates "dimness of sight," that change in the power of vision when the stimulant reaches the brain. Septuagint, "Whose eyes are livid (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>)?" The effects of intemperance are described in a well known passage of Lucretius, 'De Rer. Nat.,' 3:475, etc. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Denique, cor hominum quota vini vis penetravit<br />Acris, et in venas discessit diditus ardor,<br />Consequitur gravitas membrorum, praespediuntur<br />Crura vacillanti, tardescit lingua, madet mens,<br />Nant oculei; clamor, singultus, jurgia gliscunt."</span> We may refer to the article in Jeremy Taylor's 'Holy Living' on "Evil Consequents to Drunkenness," and to Ecclus. 34 (31):25, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:29-35 Solomon warns against drunkenness. Those that would be kept from sin, must keep from all the beginnings of it, and fear coming within reach of its allurements. Foresee the punishment, what it will at last end in, if repentance prevent not. It makes men quarrel. Drunkards wilfully make woe and sorrow for themselves. It makes men impure and insolent. The tongue grows unruly; the heart utters things contrary to reason, religion, and common civility. It stupifies and besots men. They are in danger of death, of damnation; as much exposed as if they slept upon the top of a mast, yet feel secure. They fear no peril when the terrors of the Lord are before them; they feel no pain when the judgments of God are actually upon them. So lost is a drunkard to virtue and honour, so wretchedly is his conscience seared, that he is not ashamed to say, I will seek it again. With good reason we were bid to stop before the beginning. Who that has common sense would contract a habit, or sell himself to a sin, which tends to such guilt and misery, and exposes a man every day to the danger of dying insensible, and awaking in hell? Wisdom seems in these chapters to take up the discourse as at the beginning of the book. They must be considered as the words of Christ to the sinner.</body></html>
