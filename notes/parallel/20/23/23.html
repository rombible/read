(See above, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm" title="To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;">Proverbs 1:2</a>.) All these are to be obtained from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm" title="If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him.">James 1:5</a>), who gives to every man "liberally," "without money and without price" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-18.htm" title="I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.">Revelation 3:18</a>, and the "treasure" and "pearl of great price" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-44.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to treasure hid in a field; the which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.">Matthew 13:44-46</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Buy the truth, and sell it not</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>). Consider truth as a thing of the highest value, and spare no pains, cost, or sacrifice to obtain it, and, when gotten, keep it safe; do not barter it for earthly profit or the pleasures of sense; do not be reasoned out of it, or laughed out of it; "sell it not," do not part with it for any consideration. The second clause gives the sphere in which truth moves, or the three properties which appertain to it. These are: <span class="cmt_word">wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">chochmah</span>), practical knowledge; <span class="cmt_word">instruction</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>), moral culture and discipline; and <span class="cmt_word">understanding</span> (<span class="accented">binah</span>), the faculty of discernment (see notes on Proverbs 1:2). This verse is omitted in the chief manuscripts of the Septuagint. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:19-28 The gracious Saviour who purchased pardon and peace for his people, with all the affection of a tender parent, counsels us to hear and be wise, and is ready to guide our hearts in his way. Here we have an earnest call to young people, to attend to the advice of their godly parents. If the heart be guided, the steps will be guided. Buy the truth, and sell it not; be willing to part with any thing for it. Do not part with it for pleasures, honours, riches, or any thing in this world. The heart is what the great God requires. We must not think to divide the heart between God and the world; he will have all or none. Look to the rule of God's word, the conduct of his providence, and the good examples of his people. Particular cautions are given against sins most destructive to wisdom and grace in the soul. It is really a shame to make a god of the belly. Drunkenness stupifies men, and then all goes to ruin. Licentiousness takes away the heart that should be given to God. Take heed of any approaches toward this sin, it is very hard to retreat from it. It bewitches men to their ruin.</body></html>
