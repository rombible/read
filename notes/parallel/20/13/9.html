A distinction may be drawn between the "light" of the righteous and "lamp" of the wicked. The one walks in the "light" of God's truth, and so his path becomes continually more plain (see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm" title="For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:">Proverbs 6:23</a>); the other walks by the glimmer of his own "lamp," the "fire" and "sparks" of his own kindling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-11.htm" title="Behold, all you that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that you have kindled. This shall you have of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.">Isaiah 50:11</a>), the fancies of his own devising, and so his end is darkness. But this distinction is not always observed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/18-5.htm" title="Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.">Job 18:5-6</a>, where "light" and "lamp" are both applied to the wicked.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The light of the righteous rejoiceth;</span> <span class="accented">laetificat</span>, Vulgate. But the verb is intransitive, and means "burn joyfully," bright and clear, as the sun rejoices as a strong man to run a race (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>). This light (<span class="accented">or</span>) is the grace and virtue which adorn the good man's life, and which beam through all his actions with a cheerful, kindly radiance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18, 19</a>). This is a true light, kindled in his heart by God, different from <span class="cmt_word">the lamp</span> (<span class="accented">ner</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the wicked,</span> which is devised and lighted by themselves, and has no element of permanence, but soon <span class="cmt_word">shall be put out</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-20.htm">Proverbs 24:20</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>, where the distinction between "light" and "lamp" is maintained). The lamp of the wicked is the false show of wisdom or piety, which may glimmer and deceive for a time, but is ere long detected and brought to naught. There may be here an allusion to a common custom in the East. "No house, however poor," says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land,' 1:117), "is left without a light burning in it all night; the housewife rising betimes to secure its continuance by replenishing the lamp with oil. If a lamp goes out, it is a fatal omen" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>). Septuagint, "The light of the righteous is everlasting; but the light of sinners is quenched." Then is introduced a couplet not found in the Hebrew, of which the latter part is borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-21.htm">Psalm 37:21</a> or Psalms 112:5, "Crafty souls go astray in sins; righteous men show mercy and pity." The Vulgate inserts this paragraph after ver. 13. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:6. An honest desire to do right, preserves a man from fatal mistakes, better than a thousand fine-drawn distinctions. 7. Some who are really poor, trade and spend as if they were rich: this is sin, and will be shame, and it will end accordingly. Some that are really rich, would be thought to be poor: in this there is want of gratitude to God, want of justice and charity to others. There are many hypocrites, empty of grace, who will not be convinced of their poverty. There are many fearing Christians, who are spiritually rich, yet think themselves poor; by their doubts, and complaints, and griefs, they make themselves poor. 8. Great riches often tempt to violence against those that possess them; but the poor are free from such perils. 9. The light of the righteous is as that of the sun, which may be eclipsed and clouded, but will continue: the Spirit is their Light, he gives a fulness of joy: that of the wicked is as a lamp of their own kindling, easily put out. 10. All contentions, whether between private persons, families, churches, or nations, are begun and carried forward by pride. Disputes would be easily prevented or ended, if it were not for pride. 11. Wealth gotten by dishonesty or vice, has a secret curse, which will speedily waste it. 12. The delay of what is anxiously hoped for, is very painful to the mind; obtaining it is very pleasant. But spiritual blessings are chiefly intended.</body></html>
