He who despises and neglects this word "brings on himself destruction." Many good authorities take the latter verb in another sense, "is pledged by it;" as Revised Version in margin, "maketh himself a debtor thereto," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is still bound to fulfil his obligations to it; he cannot escape duty by ignoring or despising it, but is pledged to do it, and will suffer for its neglect. Hence Christ's injunction to agree with our adversary quickly while we are in the way with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>). Vulgate, "He who disparages (<span class="accented">detrahit</span>) anything binds himself for the future." Septuagint, "He who despises a thing (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, 'a command') shall be despised by it." <span class="accented">Virtus se contemnentem contemnit. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>). The Vulgate rendering, "shall live in peace," and that of the Septuagint, "shall be healthful," are not so suitable. The "fearing the commandment" implies obedience to it; and reward is considered as fully pledged to obedience as punishment is to neglect. The Septuagint here adds a distich which Ewald regards as genuine, "Unto a crafty son there shall be nothing good; but to a wise servant all actions shall prosper, and his way shall be guided aright." This is also found in the Vulgate of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>. The Vulgate here inserts the paragraph found in the Septuagint at ver. 9 (<span class="accented">q.v</span>.), <span class="accented">Animae dolosae errant in peccatis</span>; <span class="accented">justi autem misericordes sunt et miserantur.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:13. He that stands in awe of God, and reverences his word, shall escape destruction, and be rewarded for his godly fear.</body></html>
