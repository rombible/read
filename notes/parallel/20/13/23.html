The word rendered "tillage" (<span class="accented">nir</span>) means ground worked for the first time, and therefore that on which much labour is bestowed. Hence the Vulgate rightly renders, <span class="accented">novalibus.</span> It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-3.htm">Jeremiah 4:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>, where our version has "fallow ground." The poor, but righteous man, who industriously cultivates his little plot of ground, secures a good return, and is happy in eating the labour of his hands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>). Intend of "the poor," the Vulgate has, "the fathers," taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> in this sense; so that the meaning would be that children who properly cultivate their paternal or hereditary fields obtain good crops. But the Authorized Version rendering is doubtless preferable. <span class="cmt_word">There is that is destroyed for want of judgment;</span> rather, as the Revised Version, <span class="accented">by reason of injustice.</span> Rich men are often brought to ruin by their disregard of right and justice (<span class="accented">mishpat</span>). Some (poor men) are amply supplied by honest labour; others (rich) lose all by wrong dealing. Vulgate, "For others it (food) is gathered contrary to justice;" Septuagint, quite astray, The righteous shall pass many years in wealth; but the unrighteous shall suddenly perish" - which seems to be an explanation or amplification of ver. 22. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:14. The rule by which the wise regulate their conduct, is a fountain yielding life and happiness. 15. The way of sinners is hard upon others, and hard to the sinner himself. The service of sin is slavery; the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles that followed the curse. 16. It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake what we are no way fit for. 17. Those that are wicked, and false to Christ and to the souls of men, do mischief, and fall into mischief; but those that are faithful, find sound words healing to others and to themselves. 18. He that scorns to be taught, will certainly be brought down. 19. There are in man strong desires after happiness; but never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their souls, who will not be persuaded to leave their sins. 20. Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company. And all that make themselves wicked will be destroyed. 21. When God pursues sinners he is sure to overtake them; and he will reward the righteous. 22. The servant of God who is not anxious about riches, takes the best method of providing for his children. 23. The poor, yet industrious, thrive, though in a homely manner, while those who have great riches are often brought to poverty for want of judgment. 24. He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and misery hereafter. 25. It is the misery of the wicked, that even their sensual appetites are always craving. The righteous feeds on the word and ordinances, to the satisfying of his soul with the promises of the gospel, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of life.</body></html>
