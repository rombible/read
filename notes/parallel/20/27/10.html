"Near" and "far off"--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in feeling.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Another proverb, a tristich, in praise of friendship. It seems to be a combination of two maxims. <span class="cmt_word">Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.</span> A father's friend is one who is connected with a family by hereditary and ancestral bonds; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Septuagint. Such a one is to be cherished and regarded with the utmost affection. <span class="cmt_word">Neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity.</span> The tried friend is more likely to help and sympathize with you than even your own brother, for a friend is born for adversity, and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>, where see notes). The mere blood relationship, which is the result of circumstances over which one has had no control, is inferior to the affectionate connection which arises from moral considerations and is the effect of deliberate choice. We must remember, too, that the practice of polygamy, with the separate establishments of the various wives, greatly weakened the tie of brotherhood. There was little love between David's sons; and Jonathan was far dearer to David himself than any of his numerous brothers were. Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. "Near" and "far off" may be taken as referring to feeling or to local position. In the former case the maxim says that a neighbour who is really attached to one by the bonds of affection is better than the closest relation who has no love or sympathy. In the latter view, the proverb enunciates the truth that a friend on the spot in time of calamity is more useful than a brother living at a distance (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint); one is sure of help at once from the former, while application to the latter must occasion delay, and may not be successful. Commentators quote Hesiod, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x397;&#x3bc;</span>., 341 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:9,10. Depend not for relief upon a kinsman, merely for kindred's sake; apply to those who are at hand, and will help in need. But there is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, and let us place entire confidence in him. 11. An affectionate parent urges his son to prudent conduct that should gladden his heart. The good conduct of Christians is the best answer to all who find fault with the gospel. 12. Where there is temptation, if we thrust ourselves into it, there will be sin, and punishment will follow. 13. An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makes himself one. 14. It is folly to be fond of being praised; it is a temptation to pride.</body></html>
