"If I honour myself," said our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-54.htm">John 8:54</a>), "my honour is nothing" And as St. Paul testifies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-18.htm">2 Corinthians 10:18</a>), "Not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>said the Greek gnomist; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>. And a trite maxim runs, "In ore proprio laus sordet;" and an English one decides, "He who praises himself is a debtor to others." Delitzsch quotes a German proverb (which loses the jingle in translation), "Eigen-lob stinkt, Freundes Lob hinkt, fremdes Lob klingt," "Self-praise stinks, friends' praise limps, strangers' praise sounds." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1 We know not what a day may bring forth. This does not forbid preparing for to-morrow, but presuming upon to-morrow. We must not put off the great work of conversion, that one thing needful. 2. There may be occasion for us to justify ourselves, but not to praise ourselves. 3,4. Those who have no command of their passions, sink under the load. 5,6. Plain and faithful rebukes are better, not only than secret hatred, but than love which compliments in sin, to the hurt of the soul. 7. The poor have a better relish of their enjoyments, and are often more thankful for them, than the rich. In like manner the proud and self-sufficient disdain the gospel; but those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, find comfort from the meanest book or sermon that testifies of Christ Jesus. 8. Every man has his proper place in society, where he may be safe and comfortable.</body></html>
