Similarly, perfumes prepared from spices, roses, and aromatic plants were employed; rooms were fumigated, persons were sprinkled with rose water, and incense was applied to the face and beard, as we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar ordered that to Daniel, in recognition of his wisdom, should be offered an oblation and sweet odours (see 'Dick of Bible,' and Kitto, 'Cyclop.,' <span class="accented">voc</span>. "Perfumes"). The heat of the climate, the insalubrious character of the houses, the profuse perspiration of the assembled guests, rendered this attention peculiarly acceptable (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>). The LXX., probably with a tacit reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, renders, "The heart delighteth in ointments, and wines, and perfumes." <span class="cmt_word">So doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</span> This is rather clumsy; the Revised Version improves it by paraphrasing, <span class="accented">that cometh from hearty counsel</span>. The meaning is that as ointment, etc., gladden the heart, so do the sweet and loving words of one who speaks from the depths of his soul. The idea is primarily of a friend who gives wise counsel, speaking the truth in love, or shows his approval by discreet commendation. The LXX. has pointed differently, and translates, "But the soul is broken by calamities (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, "The soul is sweetened by the good counsels of a friend." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:9,10. Depend not for relief upon a kinsman, merely for kindred's sake; apply to those who are at hand, and will help in need. But there is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, and let us place entire confidence in him. 11. An affectionate parent urges his son to prudent conduct that should gladden his heart. The good conduct of Christians is the best answer to all who find fault with the gospel. 12. Where there is temptation, if we thrust ourselves into it, there will be sin, and punishment will follow. 13. An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makes himself one. 14. It is folly to be fond of being praised; it is a temptation to pride.</body></html>
