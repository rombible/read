So Christians are exhorted to let their "light so shine before men" that their Father in heaven may be thereby glorified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son, be wise, and make my heart glad.</span> The exhortation of a father to his son, or of a teacher to his pupil. Such address is not found elsewhere in this latter portion of the book, though common in previous parts. Delitzsch translates, "become wise." <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, Septuagint. Such development of wisdom delights a father's heart, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15, 24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That I may</span> <span class="cmt_word">answer him that reproacheth me</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-42.htm">Psalm 119:42</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>; Ecclus. 30:2). If the pupil did not show wisdom and morality in his conduct, the teacher would incur blame for the apparent failure of his education; whereas the high tone of the disciple might be appealed to as a proof of the merit and efficacy of the tutor's discipline. On the other hand, the evil doings of Hebrews often made the Name of God to be blasphemed among the Gentiles; just as nowadays the inconsistent lives of Christians are the greatest impediment to the success of missionary efforts in heathen countries. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ut possis exprobanti respondere sermonem</span>. So Septuagint, "And remove from thyself reproachful words." But the first person is in accordance with the Hebrew. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:9,10. Depend not for relief upon a kinsman, merely for kindred's sake; apply to those who are at hand, and will help in need. But there is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, and let us place entire confidence in him. 11. An affectionate parent urges his son to prudent conduct that should gladden his heart. The good conduct of Christians is the best answer to all who find fault with the gospel. 12. Where there is temptation, if we thrust ourselves into it, there will be sin, and punishment will follow. 13. An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makes himself one. 14. It is folly to be fond of being praised; it is a temptation to pride.</body></html>
