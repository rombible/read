A man who is so eager to express his thanks that he begins early in the morning, and in so loud a voice as to draw upon his patron the attention of all the bystanders, is looked upon as a nuisance; any one would as soon be cursed as blessed by him. So God loves heartfelt gratitude offered in secret. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5-6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning.</span> What is meant is ostentatious salutation, which puts itself forward in order to stand well with a patron, and to be beforehand with other servile competitors for favour. Juvenal satirized such parasitical effusion ('Sat.' 5:19) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Habet Trebius, propter quod rumpere somnum<br />Debeat et ligulas dimittere, sollicitus, ne<br />Tots salutaris jam turba peregerit orbem,<br />Sideribus dubiis, aut illo tempore, quo se<br />Frigida circumagunt pigri surraca Bootae."</span> The "loud voice" intimates the importunate nature of such public trumpeting of gratitude, as the "rising early" denotes its inopportune and tactless insistency, which cannot wait for a convenient opportunity for its due expression. It shall be counted a curse to him. The receiver of this sordid adulation, and indeed all the bystanders, would just as soon be cursed by the parasite as blessed in this offensive manner, This clamorous outpouring of gratitude is not accepted as a return by the benefactor; he sees the mean motives by which it is dictated self-interest, hope of future benefits - and he holds it as cheap as he would the curses of such a person. The nuisance of such flattery is mentioned by Euripides, 'Orest.,' 1161 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. Duo sunt genera prosecutorum, says St. Augustine ('In Psalm.,' 69), "sciliet vituperantium et adulantium; sed plus prosequitur lingua adulatoris, quam manus prosecutoris." "Woe unto you," said Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-26.htm">Luke 6:26</a>), "when all men shall speak well of you." "Do I seek to please men?" asked St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>); "for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ." Vers. 15 and 16 form a tetrastich on the subject of the termagant wife. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:9,10. Depend not for relief upon a kinsman, merely for kindred's sake; apply to those who are at hand, and will help in need. But there is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, and let us place entire confidence in him. 11. An affectionate parent urges his son to prudent conduct that should gladden his heart. The good conduct of Christians is the best answer to all who find fault with the gospel. 12. Where there is temptation, if we thrust ourselves into it, there will be sin, and punishment will follow. 13. An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makes himself one. 14. It is folly to be fond of being praised; it is a temptation to pride.</body></html>
