We meet with the same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-9.htm">Proverbs 4:9</a>, "She [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom] shall give to thine head an ornament of grace." The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">liv'yah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">lavah</span>), "to wind a roll" (Delitzsch) or "to be joined closely with" (Gesenius), and hence signifies an ornament that is twisted, and so a wreath or garland. Gejerus and Schultens translate the phrase by <span class="accented">corolla gratiosa, i.e.</span> "a crown full of grace," and so meaning conferring or producing grace, just as the expression, "the chastisement of our peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>), means the chastisement bringing or procuring our peace. So again a "precious stone," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>, margin, "a stone of grace," is one conferring gracefulness. The marginal reading, "an adding" (<span class="accented">additamentum</span>, Vatablus), conveys, though obscurely, the same idea; and this sense is again reproduced in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ut addatur gratia capiti suo</span> ("in order that grace may be added to thy head"). The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And chains about thy neck.</span> <span class="accented">Chains</span>; properly, <span class="accented">necklaces</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">anakim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">anak</span>), "a cellar or necklace;" the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or "golden collar," of the LXX., and <span class="accented">torques</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> twisted neckchain) of the Vulgate. There is a very apposite parallel to this verse in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20, 21</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>). The gold chain round the neck was a mark of distinction, and was conferred on Joseph by Pharaoh when investing him with authority and dignity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>), and on Daniel by Belshazzar in the same way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>). The mere adornment of the person with gold and pearls, without the further adornment of the moral character with Christian graces, is deprecated both by St. Paul and St. Peter (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9, 10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3, 4</a>). <span class="accented">Neck</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gar'g'roth</span>) only occurs in the plural (Gesenius). (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-21.htm">Proverbs 6:21</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-9 Fools are persons who have no true wisdom, who follow their own devices, without regard to reason, or reverence for God. Children are reasonable creatures, and when we tell them what they must do, we must tell them why. But they are corrupt and wilful, therefore with the instruction there is need of a law. Let Divine truths and commands be to us most honourable; let us value them, and then they shall be so to us.</body></html>
