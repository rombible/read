<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-34.htm">Nehemiah 10:34</a>; and the custom of freebooters dividing the spoil by lot is here alluded to (Holden); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a> in illustration of the practice of casting lots, "They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture." The sense is, "you shall equally with the others cast lots for your share of the spoil" (Zockler, Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">Let us all have one parse.</span> <span class="accented">Purse</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> (<span class="accented">kis</span>), the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the LXX., the <span class="accented">marsupium</span> of the Vulgate, is the receptacle in which money is placed for security. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a> it is used for the bag in which traders kept their weights, "the weights of the bag;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-31.htm">Proverbs 23:31</a> it is translated "cup," the wine cup. It here signifies the common stock, the aggregate of the gains of the robbers contributed to a common fund. The booty captured by each or any is to be thrown into one common stock, to form one purse, to be divided by lot among all the members of the band. On this community of goods among robbers, compare the Hebrew proverb, <span class="accented">In localis, in poculis, in ira.</span> Community of goods among the wicked carries with it community in crime, just as the community of goods among the early Christians implied community in good works and in the religious sentiments of the Christian body or Church. The Rabbi Salomon Isacides offers another explanation (which leaves the choice open to youth either to share in the spoil by lot, or to live at the expense of a common fund, as he may prefer): "Si voles, nobiscum spolia partieris, si etiam magis placebit, sociali communique marsupio nobiscum vives" - "If thou wilt, thou shalt share with us the booty; ay, if it like thee more, thou halt live with us on a confederate and common purse" (see Cornelius a Lapide). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-19 Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of the destroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?</body></html>
