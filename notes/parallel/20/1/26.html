They are not to be taken literally, of course, for the sight of human folly can give no pleasure to Him. They signify that He will act as if He mocked when He refuses to hear their cry. Similar expressions, imputing human actions to the Almighty, are <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-5.htm" title="And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.">Genesis 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm" title="Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm" title="For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.

In the time of their calamity wisdom will exult or rejoice. The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, however, favours the rendering of the Authorized Version. <span class="accented">Calamity</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, <span class="accented">eyd</span>) is heavy overwhelming misfortune, that which oppresses and crushes its victims. The terrific nature of the punishment of the wicked is marked by a succession of terms all of terrible import - calamity, fear, desolation, destruction, distress, and anguish (vers. 26, 27). When these come upon them, then Wisdom will laugh and have them in derision. The verbs "laugh" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, <span class="accented">sakhak</span>) and "mock" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>) are the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, where they are rendered "to mock" and "have in derision." <span class="cmt_word">When your fear cometh;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has actually arrived. <span class="accented">Fear</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">pakhad</span>); here used metonymically for that which causes the fear or terror (<span class="accented">id, quod timebatis</span>, Vulgate). There is a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
