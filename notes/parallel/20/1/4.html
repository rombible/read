We have this idea expressed as follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, "The prudent man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">arum</span>) foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself." In the Arabic Version it is rendered by <span class="accented">calliditas</span>, "shrewdness," in a good sense. The Hebrew <span class="accented">ar'mah</span>, like the Latin <span class="accented">calliditas</span>, also means "craftiness," as appears in the use of the cognate adjective <span class="accented">arum</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, where we read, "The serpent was more subtle," etc. For "subtilty" the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, a Greek word which appears to be employed altogether in a bad sense, as "trickery," "villainy," "knavery;" but that scarcely appears to be the meaning of the Hebrew here, since the aim of the Proverbs is ethical and beneficial in the highest degree. The Vulgate <span class="accented">astutia</span>, the quality of the <span class="accented">astutus</span>, beside the bad sense of craftiness, also boars the good sense of <span class="accented">shrewdness</span>, sagacity, and so better represents the Hebrew. "Subtilty may turn to evil, but it also takes its place among the highest moral gifts" (Plumptre). <span class="accented">The simple</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">ph'thaim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">p'ti</span>) from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">pathakh</span>), "to be open," properly means the open-hearted, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who are susceptible to external impressions (Zockler), and so easily misled. The word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-18.htm">Proverbs 14:18</a>; and Proverbs 27:12. The LXX. properly renders the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "unknowing of evil." The same idea is indirectly expressed in the Vulgate <span class="accented">parvuli</span>, "the very young;" and the term is paraphrased in the Arabic Version, <span class="accented">iis in quibus non est malitia</span> ("those who are without malice"). The Hebrew here means "simple" in the sense of inexperienced. <span class="cmt_word">To the young man knowledge and discretion.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">naar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) is here used representatively for "youth" (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">adolescens</span>) in general, which stands in need of the qualities here mentioned. It advances in idea beyond "the simple." <span class="accented">Knowledge</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">daath</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> experimental knowledge (Delitzsch); insight (Gesenius); knowledge of good and evil (Plumptre). The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which clasically means perception by the senses and also by the mind. <span class="accented">Discretion</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">m'zimmah</span>), properly "thoughtfulness," and hence "circumspection" or "caution" (Zockler), or "discernment," that which sets a man on his guard and prevents him being duped by others (Plumptre). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> was probably adopted by the LXX. in its primary sense as representing the act of thinking; <span class="accented">intellectus</span> (Vulgate), equivalent to "a discerning" (see the marginal "<span class="accented">advisement"</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-6 The lessons here given are plain, and likely to benefit those who feel their own ignorance, and their need to be taught. If young people take heed to their ways, according to Solomon's Proverbs, they will gain knowledge and discretion. Solomon speaks of the most important points of truth, and a greater than Solomon is here. Christ speaks by his word and by his Spirit. Christ is the Word and the Wisdom of God, and he is made to us wisdom.</body></html>
