Its meaning is well represented by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and the Authorized Version "to receive." The Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, is infinitive, and means properly "to take, or lay hold of," hence "to receive," Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, No doubt it conveys the idea of intellectual reception (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>). <span class="accented">The instruction of wisdom</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">musar has'kel</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the discipline or moral training which leads on to reason, intelligence, or wisdom (as Hitzig, Fuerst, Zockler); or discipline full of insight, discernment, or thoughtfulness (as Umbreit, Ewald, Delitzsch). The phrase does not mean the wisdom which instruction imparts. The <span class="accented">word musar</span> occurs here in a slightly different sense from its use in ver. 2; there it is objective, here its meaning as a medium for the attainment of wisdom is more distinctly brought out. <span class="accented">Wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">haskel</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> properly "thoughtfulness" (so Umbreit. Ewald, Delitzsch, Plumptre). It is strictly the infinitive absolute of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">sakal</span>), "to entwine or involve," and as a substantive it stands for the thinking through of a subject, so "thoughtfulness." The LXX. renders this sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>, which St. Jerome understands as "versutias sermonum et solutiones aenigmatum" ("the cunning or craftiness of words and the explication of enigmas"). <span class="cmt_word">Justice, and judgment, and equity.</span> These words seem to be the unfolding of the meaning contained in the expression, "the instruction of wisdom." Holden regards the last four words as objective genitives dependent on "instruction," but wrongly. Cornelius a Laplde states that "justice and judgment and equity" indicate the same thing in different aspects. "<span class="accented">Justice</span> stands for the thing itself - that which is <span class="accented">just</span>; <span class="accented">judgment</span> in respect of right reason, which says it is just; and <span class="accented">equity</span> in respect of its being agreeable to the Law of God." <span class="accented">Justice</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">tsedek</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">tsadak</span>), "to be right, or straight;" in a moral sense it means "rectitude," "<span class="accented">right</span>," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> (Gesenius). The underlying idea is that of straightness. Heidenheim, quoted by Delitzsch, maintains that in <span class="accented">tsedek</span> the conception of the <span class="accented">justum</span> prevails; but the latter enlarges its meaning, and holds that it also has the idea of a mode of thought and action regulated, not by the letter of the Law, but by love, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>. Plumptre thinks "righteousness" would be a better translation of the word, on the ground that the Hebrew includes the ideas of truth and beneficence. Compare with this the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. Zockler also renders "righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which is in accord with the will and ordinances of God as Supreme Judge." In the Authorized Version, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>, where we have the same collocation of words, <span class="accented">tsedek is</span> translated "righteousness;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>, "He who utters truth shows forth righteousness (<span class="accented">tsedek</span>)." <span class="accented">Judgment</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">mish'pat</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">shapat</span>), "to adjust, judge," corresponds with the Hebrew in meaning; it is the delivery of a correct judgment on human actions. Compare the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented">Equity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rectitude in thought and action (Delitzsch), or integrity (Zockler). This quality expresses upright demeanour or honoumble action on one's own part individually, while "judgment" has regard both to our own and the actions of others. The Hebrew, <span class="accented">mesharim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), used only in the plural, is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">yashar</span>), "to be straight or even," and is equal to "uprightness." The plural form is reproduced in the marginal reading "equities;" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a>, "Let thine eyes beheld the things that are equal (<span class="accented">mesharim</span>)." The Vulgate reads <span class="accented">aequitas</span> and the Syriae <span class="accented">rectitudo.</span> The two ideas in judgment and equity appear to be expressed in the LXX. by the phrase. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-6 The lessons here given are plain, and likely to benefit those who feel their own ignorance, and their need to be taught. If young people take heed to their ways, according to Solomon's Proverbs, they will gain knowledge and discretion. Solomon speaks of the most important points of truth, and a greater than Solomon is here. Christ speaks by his word and by his Spirit. Christ is the Word and the Wisdom of God, and he is made to us wisdom.</body></html>
