Thus Umbreit and Elster, regarding the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">yish'ma</span>) as conditional, translate, "if the wise man hear;" on the other hand, Delitzsch and Zockler take it as voluntative," let the wise man hear," ete. The principle here enunciated is again stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>, "Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser," and finds expression under the gospel economy in the words of our Lord, "For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>; cf. 25:29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-25.htm">Mark 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a> and Mark 14:26). <span class="accented">Learning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">lekakh</span>), in the sense of being transmitted or received (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Dunn). A man of understanding (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">intelligens</span>) is a person of intelligence who lays himself open to be instructed. <span class="accented">Wise counsels</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">takh'buloth</span>). This word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khevel</span>), a ship rope, a denominative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khovel</span>), and only occurs in the plural. It signifies those maxims of prudence by which a man may direct his course aright through life (cf. <span class="accented">regimen</span>, Arabic). The imagery is taken from the management of a vessel, and is reproduced in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">gubernatio.</span> "Navigationi vitam comparat" (Mariana). The word is almost exclusively confined to the Proverbs, and occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-5.htm">Proverbs 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-18.htm">Proverbs 20:18</a>; and Proverbs 24:6, usually in a good sense, though it has the meaning of "stratagem" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-5.htm">Proverbs 12:5</a>. In the only other passage where it is found it is used of God's power in turning about the clouds; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-12.htm">Job 37:12</a>, "And it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bright cloud] is turned round about by his counsels (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, <span class="accented">b'thakh'bulothau</span>)." It is the practical correlative of "learning," in the first part of the verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-6 The lessons here given are plain, and likely to benefit those who feel their own ignorance, and their need to be taught. If young people take heed to their ways, according to Solomon's Proverbs, they will gain knowledge and discretion. Solomon speaks of the most important points of truth, and a greater than Solomon is here. Christ speaks by his word and by his Spirit. Christ is the Word and the Wisdom of God, and he is made to us wisdom.</body></html>
