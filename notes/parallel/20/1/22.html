The discourse begins in the same way as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a> (Zockler), and the classification of the persons addressed - the simple, the scorners, and the sinners - closely resembles that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. In the order there is a progression from the least to the most culpable. <span class="accented">The simple</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">p'thayim</span>)<span class="accented">, as</span> in ver. 4, those who are indifferent through thoughtlessness and inconsiderateness, and are thereby open to evil. <span class="cmt_word">The scorners</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">letsim</span>); or, <span class="accented">mockers</span>, the same as the (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">latson</span>) "scornful men" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-8.htm">Proverbs 29:8</a>, derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">luts</span>), "to deride, mock," probably by imitating the voice in derision. The mockers are those who hold all things in derision, both human and Divine, who contemn God's admonitions, and treat with ridicule both threatenings and promises alike. <span class="cmt_word">Fools</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">ch'silim</span>), a different word from the <span class="accented">evilim</span> of ver. 7, but signifying much the same, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the obdurate, the hardened, <span class="accented">stolidi</span>, those who walk after the sight of their eyes and the imagination of their hearts - a class not ignorant of knowledge, but hating it because of the restraint it puts them under. The word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>, in the sense of the incorrigible; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-3.htm">Proverbs 26:3, 4</a> as a term of the greatest contempt. The <span class="accented">enallage</span>, or interchange of tenses in the original - the verbs "love" and "hate" being future, and "delight" being perfect - is not reproducible in English. The perfect is used interchangeably with the future where the action or state is represented as first coming to pass or in progress, and, as Zockler remarks, may be inchoative, and so be rendered "become fond of," instead of "be fond of." But it appears to represent not so much a state or action first coming to pass as in progress (see Geseuius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 126, 3). Bottcher (&sect; 948, 2) translates it by <span class="accented">concupiverint, i.e.</span> "How long shall ye have delighted in scorning?" The futures express "love" and "hate" as habitual sentiments (Delitzsch). It is to be noted that the language of Wisdom, in vers. 22 and 23, is expressive of the most tender and earnest solicitude. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
