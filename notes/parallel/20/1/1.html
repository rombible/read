In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7, 8</a> it is used of the prophetic predictions of Balaam; certain didactic psalms, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a> and Psalm 78:2, are so designated, and in Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a> and Job 29:1) it describes the sententious discourses of wise men. While all these come under the generic term of <span class="accented">m'shalim</span>, though few or no comparisons are found in them, we find the term <span class="accented">mashal</span> sometimes used of what are proverbs in the sense of popular sayings. Compare "Therefore it became a proverb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>), Is Saul also among the prophets?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-12.htm">1 Samuel 10:12</a>); and see also other instances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a> and Ezekiel 18:2. In this sense it is also found in the collection before us. The predominant idea of the term, however, is that of comparison or similitude, and as such it is better represented by the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> (from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, "to set or place side by side"), literally, a placing beside, or comparison, than by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "a byword," or "a trite wayside saying," though in the Greek of the synoptic Gospels <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. The English word "proverb" insufficiently renders the wider scope of meaning conveyed in the Hebrew <span class="accented">mashal</span>, and is not quite accurately rendered here, since of proverbs in our ordinary signification of that word there are comparatively few in this collection. The Hebrew word here means "maxims," "aphorisms," "wise counsels." <span class="accented">Of Solomon.</span> Most modern commentators (Delitzsch, Zockler, Fuerst, Stuart, Plumptre, etc.), while attributing, in a greater or less degree, the authorship of the book to Solomon, regard the insertion of his name in the title as indicating rather that he is the dominant spirit among those wise men of his age, some of whose sayings are here incorporated with his own. <span class="cmt_word">King of Israel</span>, as forming the second hemistich of the verse, goes with "Solomon," and not "David." This is indicated in the Authorized Version by the position of the comma. The Arabic Version omits allusion to David, and reads, "Proverbia, nempe documenta Salomonis sapientis, qui regnavit super filios Israel." The proverbial or parabolic form of teaching was a recognized mode of instruction among the Hebrews, and in the Christian Church is recommended by St. Clement of Alexandria ('Strom.,' lib. 11, <span class="accented">init.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-6 The lessons here given are plain, and likely to benefit those who feel their own ignorance, and their need to be taught. If young people take heed to their ways, according to Solomon's Proverbs, they will gain knowledge and discretion. Solomon speaks of the most important points of truth, and a greater than Solomon is here. Christ speaks by his word and by his Spirit. Christ is the Word and the Wisdom of God, and he is made to us wisdom.</body></html>
