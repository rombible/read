This expression, "the fear of the Lord," occurs thirteen times in the Proverbs, and plays a prominent part throughout the Old Testament.<p>"When God of old came down from heaven,<p>In power and wrath He came."<p>That law which was given amid "blackness, and darkness, and tempest" was enforced by the threat, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm" title="For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.">Galatians 3:10</a>). Men had to be taught how hateful sin was to God, and the lesson was for the most part instilled into them by the fear of immediate punishment. (Comp. Deuteronomy 28) But when the lesson had been learnt, and when mankind had found by experience that they were unable to keep the law of God by their own strength, then the new covenant of mercy was revealed from Calvary, even free justification "by God's grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>). And with this new message a new motive to obedience was preached. The "fear of the Lord" was now superseded by the higher duty of the "love of God," and of man, for His sake. "The love of Christ constraineth us," says St. Paul. "We love Him because He first loved us," writes St. John. Now, it was seen that, although the "fear of the Lord" may be the "beginning of wisdom," yet something better still may be aimed at: that "he that feareth is not made perfect in love;" and so the teaching of St. John, the last New Testament writer, is summed up in the words, "If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm" title="Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.">1John 4:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Fools </span>(<span class= "ital">'evilim</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--Self-willed, headstrong persons, who will listen to no advice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7-ch. 9:18.</span> - Part II. INTRODUCTORY SECTION. The first main section of the book begins here and ends at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>. It consists of a series of fifteen admonitory discourses addressed to youth by the Teacher and Wisdom personified, with the view to exhibit the excellence of wisdom, and generally to illustrate the motto, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge," or wisdom. It urges strong encouragements to virtue, and equally strong dissuasives from vice, and shows that the attainment of wisdom in its true sense is the aim of all moral effort. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.</span> This proposition is by some commentators regarded as the motto, symbol, or device of the book (Delitzsch, Umbreit, Zockler, Plumptre). Others, following the Masoretic arrangement of the Hebrew text, consider it as forming part of the superscription (Ewald, Bertheau, Elster, Keil). As a general proposition expressing the essence of the philosophy of the Israelites, and from its relation to the rest of the contents of this book, it seems rightly to occupy a special and individual position. The proposition occurs again in the Proverbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, and it is met with in similar or slightly modified forms in other books which belong to the same group of sacred writings, that is, those which treat of religious philosophy - the Khokhmah; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>; Ecclus. 1:16, 25. With this maxim we may compare "The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-33.htm">Proverbs 15:33</a>). <span class="accented">The fear of the Lord</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">yir'ath y'hovah</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the fear of Jehovah.</span> The expression describes that reverential attitude or holy fear which man, when his heart is set aright, observes towards God. The original word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">yir'ath</span>) for "fear," is properly the infinitive of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, (<span class="accented">yare</span>), "to fear or reverence," and as a substantive means "reverence or holy fear" (Gesenius). <span class="accented">Servile</span> or abject fear (as Jerome, Beda, Estius) is not to be understood, but <span class="accented">filial</span> fear (as Gejerus, Mercerus, Cornelius a Lapide, Cartwright), by which we fear to offend God - that fear of Jehovah which is elsewhere described as "to hate evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>), and in which a predominating element is love. Wardlaw remarks that the "fear of the Lord" is in invariable union with love and in invariable proportion to it. We truly fear God just in proportion as we truly love him. The fear of the Lord also carries with it the whole worship of God. It is observable that the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is used in the Hebrew, and not <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), a peculiarity which is invariably marked in the Authorized Version by small capitals. <span class="accented">The beginning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">reshith</span>). This word has been understood in three different senses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As <span class="accented">initium</span>, the beginning; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the initial step or starting point at which every one who wishes to follow true wisdom must begin (Gejerus, Zockler, Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As <span class="accented">caput</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the most excellent or principal part, the noblest or best wisdom. This sense is adopted in the marginal reading (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>) (Holden, Trapp). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> As the <span class="accented">principium</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the origin, or basis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>, "She is the origin, or basis (<span class="accented">reshith</span>) of the sin of the daughter of Zion." Delitzsch regards the original, <span class="accented">reshith</span>, as embracing the two ideas of commencement and origin, in the same way as the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>. Wisdom has its origin in God, and whoever fears him receives it if he prays in faith (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, sqq.) (Vatablus, Mercerus, Delitzsch). That the first sense, viz. that of beginning, is to be understood here appears from the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a>, where the corresponding word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>. (<span class="accented">t'killath</span>), "beginning," from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khalal</span>), "to begin;" cf. also the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, in this sense, and the <span class="accented">initium</span> of the Syriac and Arabic Versions. All previous knowledge to "the fear of the Lord" is comparative folly. He who would advance in knowledge must first be imbued with a reverence or holy fear of God. But <span class="cmt_word">fools despise wisdom and instruction;</span> or, according to the inverted order of the words in the original, <span class="accented">wisdom and instruction fools despise</span>, the association of ideas in the three words, "knowledge," "wisdom," and "instruction," thus being more continuously sustained. This arrangement links on the two latter words with "the fear of the Lord," and so helps towards the elucidation of the sense in which "fools" is to be understood <span class="accented">Fools</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">evilim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">evil</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">aval</span>), "to be perverse," here properly designates the incorrigible, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>, and those who are unwilling to know God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>), and hence refuse and despise wisdom and salutary discipline, those "who set at nought all his counsel, and will none of his reproof." The word is opposed to the "prudent" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>) and to the "wise" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>). Delitzsch understands it as "thick, hard, stupid," from the <span class="accented">root aval, coalescere, incrassari.</span> Schultens uses <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">erassi pro stupidis</span>, to represent the original. Dunn takes it in the same sense as "gross or dull of understanding." Fuerst, adopted by Wordsworth, regards it in the sense of having no moral stamina, from the root meaning "to be slack, weak, lax, or lazy." But none of these explanations seems, in my opinion, to coincide sufficiently with the evil and depraved activity expressed in the verb "despise," which follows, and which describes the conduct of this class. The LXX. renders the word or action by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">impii</span>, "godless," "profane," and the Vulgate by <span class="accented">stulti. Despise</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">bazu</span>) is perfect, but is properly translated by the present, because the perfect here represents a condition long continued and still existing (Gesenius, &sect; 126); cf. the Latin <span class="accented">odi</span>, <span class="accented">memini</span>, etc. The LXX. uses the future <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they will set at nought; the Vulgate, the present (<span class="accented">despiciunt</span>). The radical meaning is most probably contemptuous trampling under the feet (Geseuius). <span class="accented">Wisdom and instruction</span> (see ver. 2). The latter clause of this verse is antithetical to the former, but the antithesis is obscurely expressed. In the Authorized Version it is marked by the adversative conjunction "but," which, however, is not in the original. The LXX. has a striking interpolation in this verse between the first and second clauses, which is partly taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "And a good understanding have all they that do it: and reverence towards God is the beginning of knowledge"). Compare the Arabic Version, which has the same interpolation: <span class="accented">Et intellectus bonus onmibus facientibus eam. Sana religio in Deum est initium prudentiae.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-9 Fools are persons who have no true wisdom, who follow their own devices, without regard to reason, or reverence for God. Children are reasonable creatures, and when we tell them what they must do, we must tell them why. But they are corrupt and wilful, therefore with the instruction there is need of a law. Let Divine truths and commands be to us most honourable; let us value them, and then they shall be so to us.</body></html>
