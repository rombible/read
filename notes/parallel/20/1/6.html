The end of the wise and intelligent man's increase in learning and prudence is that he may be thus enabled to understand other proverbs. Schultens, followed by Holden, takes the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">l'havin</span>) as a gerund, <span class="accented">intelligendo sententias.</span> This rendering does not represent the end, but points to the proverbs, etc., as means by which the wise generally attain to learning and prudence. <span class="cmt_word">And the interpretation;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">m'litsah</span>). It is difficult to determine the exact meaning of this word. By Gesenius it is rendered "enigma, riddle;" by Bertheau and Hitzig, "discourse requiring interpretation:" by Delitzsch, "symbol; by Havernick and Keil, "brilliant and pleasing discourse;" and by Fuerst, "figurative and involved discourse." By comparing it with the corresponding words, "dark sayings," it may be regarded as designating that which is obscure and involved in meaning; compare <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.). It only occurs here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>, where it is rendered "taunting proverb." The marginal reading is "an eloquent speech," equivalent to <span class="accented">facundia</span>, "eloquence." Vatablus says that the Hebrews understood it as "mensuram et pondus verbi." <span class="cmt_word">The words of the wise;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the utterances of the <span class="accented">khakhamim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). This expression occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9</a>:19 and Ecclesiastes 12:11. In the latter they are described as "goads and as nails fastened by the ministers of assemblies" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "authors of compilations," as Mendelssohn), because they cannot fail to make an impression on everybody good or bad. The expression, as used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, implies that other than Solomonic proverbs are included in this collection. <span class="cmt_word">And their dark sayings;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">v'khidotham</span>). The Hebrew <span class="accented">khidah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), as <span class="accented">m'litsah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>)# its parallel in the preceding hemistich, designates obscure, involved utterances. It plainly has the sense of "enigma" (Fleischer, apud Delitzsch). Compare <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), and <span class="accented">aenigmata</span> (Vulgate), which latter is followed by the Chaldea Paraphrase and Syriac (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter <span class="accented">dark sayings</span> of old"). Gesenius derives it from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">khud</span>), "to tie knots," and hence arrives at its meaning as an involved or twisted sententious expression, an <span class="accented">enigma.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-6 The lessons here given are plain, and likely to benefit those who feel their own ignorance, and their need to be taught. If young people take heed to their ways, according to Solomon's Proverbs, they will gain knowledge and discretion. Solomon speaks of the most important points of truth, and a greater than Solomon is here. Christ speaks by his word and by his Spirit. Christ is the Word and the Wisdom of God, and he is made to us wisdom.</body></html>
