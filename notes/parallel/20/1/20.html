It is possible that Solomon may have originally meant in this passage only to describe, in highly poetic language, the influence and work in their generation of those in whom "the fear of the Lord" dwells. So, too, many of the Psalms (Psalms 45, for example), in the first instance it would seem, are intended to describe the excellence of some earthly saint or king, yet they are completely fulfilled only in the Son of man, the ideal of all that is noblest and best in man. And thus the description of Wisdom in her manifold activity, as represented in Proverbs 1, 8, 9, so closely corresponds to the work of our Lord, as depicted in the New Testament, that from the earliest times of Christianity these passages have been held to be a prophecy of Him; and there is good reason for such a view. For a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm" title="Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:">Luke 11:49</a> ("Therefore also said the wisdom of God, Behold, I send," &c.) with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm" title="Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:">Matthew 23:34</a> (where He says, "Behold, I send") would seem to show that He applied the title to Himself. St. Paul in like manner speaks of Him as the "Wisdom of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1Corinthians 1:24</a>); says He has been "made unto us wisdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1Corinthians 1:30</a>); and that in Him "are hid all the treasures of wisdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>). For passages from the Fathers embodying this view, see references in Bishop Wordsworth on this chapter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-33.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">Second admonitory discourse. Address of Wisdom personified, exhibing the folly of those who wilfully reject, and the security of those who hearken to, her counsels.</span> The sacred writer, in this section, as also in ch. 8, uses the rhetorical figure of prosopopceia, or impersonation. Wisdom is represented as speaking and as addressing the simple, scorners, and fools. The address itself is one of the noblest specimens of sacred eloquence, expressing in rapid succession the strongest phases of feeling - pathetic solicitude with abundant promise, indignant scorn at the rejection of her appeal, the judicial severity of offended majesty upon offenders, and lastly the judicial complacency which delights in mercy towards the obedient. The imagery in part is taken from the forces of nature in their irresistible and overwhelming violence and destructive potency. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom crieth without.</span> <span class="accented">Wisdom</span>. The Hebrew word (<span class="accented">khochmoth</span>) here used to designate Wisdom seems to be an abstract derivation from the ordinary <span class="accented">khochmah.</span> The form is peculiar to the Proverbs and Psalms, in the former occurring four times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-1.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-7.htm">Proverbs 24:7</a>), and in the latter twice only (viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>). As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a> and Proverbs 24:7, it is a <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> of the feminine gender, a variety of the <span class="accented">pluralis extensivus</span>, as Bottcher prefers to denominate it. The feminine form may he determined by the general law which associates purity and serenity with womanhood (Plumptre). The idea of plurality, however, is not that of extension, but of comprehension, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is not so much all kinds of wisdom which is presented to us, as all the varieties under which wisdom <span class="accented">par excellence</span> may be regarded and is comprehended. The plural form of the word denotes the highest character or excellence in which wisdom can be conceived; or, as the marginal reading expresses it, wisdoms, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> excellent wisdom. Other instances of the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> are met with in Holy Writ, <span class="accented">e.g. Elohim</span>, God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "God of Gods," either from the polytheistic view, or from the monotheistic view as expressive of God's might in manifestation, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <span class="accented">k'doshim</span>, "the Holy (God)," <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a>; <span class="accented">adonim</span>, for <span class="accented">adon</span> "lord" (Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 108. 2 <span class="accented">b</span>). In the conception of Wisdom here presented to us in the text we have the germ of an idea which, on the principles of expansion, developed subsequently in the consciousness of the Christian Church into a definite identification of Wisdom with the Second Person of the blessed Trinity. There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>, where Christ speaks of himself as <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "the Wisdom of God," that shall send prophets and apostles into the world, and thereby identifies himself with Wisdom (cf. this with vers. 20, 21; ch. 7.). Again, a striking similarity is observable between the teaching of Divine Wisdom and that of the Incarnate Word, as much in their promises as in their threats and warnings. But it is difficult to determine with accuracy to what extent the Messianic import of the personification was present to the <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of the sacred writers, and whether Wisdom as here presented to us is simply a poetic and abstract personification or a distinct by-postatizing of the Word. Dorner ('Pers. of Christ,' Introd., p. 16), with reference to ch. 8:22, etc., says that though Wisdom is introduced speaking as a personality distinct from God, still the passage does not lead clearly to an hypostatizing of the Khochmah. Dollinger ('Heidenthum und Judenthum,' bk. 10. pt. 3. sec. 2 <span class="accented">a</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, etc.) maintains that Wisdom is "the personified idea of the mind of God in creation," rather than the presence of "a distinct hypostasis." Lucke (see references in Liddon, 'Bampton Lects.') holds that in Proverbs Wisdom is merely a personification It is clear that whatever is predicated of Wisdom in ch. 8. must be also predicated of her in the passage before us, in reference either to the hypostatic or opposite view. On the other hand, a large number of expositors, dating from the earliest periods of the Christian Church down to the present time, see in Wisdom a distinct hypostasis, or person - the Lord Jesus Christ. A fuller investigation of this subject will be seen in our remarks on ch. 8. For the present we observe that Wisdom is essentially Divine. Her authority, her utterances, whether of promise, threat, scorn, or vengeance, are the authority, the utterances, of God. <span class="accented">Crieth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">crieth loudly</span>, or <span class="accented">aloud.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">ranan</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) is "to vibrate the voice," and conveys the idea of the clear loud ringing tones with which proclamations were made; cf. the Vulgate <span class="accented">praedicare</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">clamitate</span>, "to cry with a loud voice." Fleischer remarks that the Arabic <span class="accented">rannan</span>, which is allied to the Hebrew verb, is used of a speaker who has a clear piercing voice. In such a way does Wisdom cry without when making her address. She elevates her voice that all may hear. The verb in the original is <span class="accented">tazonnah</span>, the feminine singular of <span class="accented">ranan</span>, and predicate to "Wisdom," according to the rule that verbs in the singular are construed with plural nouns having a singular signification, especially the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> (see Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 146. 2). <span class="accented">Without.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">bakhuts</span>) is here used adverbially, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22</a>, and signifies "in the open places," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> abroad, without, as opposed to the space within the walls. The writer here begins his enumeration of the five places wherein Wisdom preaches, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> without, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the streets, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in chief places of concourse, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> in the opening of the gates, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> in the city, all of which are public, and thus indicate the publicity of her announcements (with those comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-1.htm">Proverbs 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-3.htm">Proverbs 9:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">She uttereth her voice;</span> or, <span class="accented">causeth her voice to be beard</span>; represented in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">dat vocem suam.</span> and in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (equivalent to "she observes free-spokenness"). The instrumentality which Wisdom uses in her public preaching are the prophets and teachers (Ecclus. 24:33; Zockler, Vatablus, Mercerus). <span class="cmt_word">In the streets;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the wide spares</span>; the Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">r'khovoth</span>), being, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>, "wide spaces," and corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the LXX.; <span class="accented">plateae</span>, Vulgate.

The word is connected with the adjective <span class="accented">rakhav</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>), "broad," "wide;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6</a> is used to designate the ample space at the gates of Oriental cities (Gesenius), though here it seems to refer rather to "squares," large open spaces, not uncommon in Oriental cities - I saw one such at Aden - or it may refer to the broad crowded thoroughfares. The Syriac reading, in <span class="accented">compitis</span>, gives a different sense, as <span class="accented">compitum</span>, equivalent to "crossroads." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
