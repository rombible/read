A short cut to wealth, and to the acquirement of that which costs others long years of steady application and carefulness, is a strong inducement (Wardlaw). <span class="accented">We shall find</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">nim'tza</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">matza</span>), properly "to reach to," and "to find," in the sense of "to come upon;" cf. Latin <span class="accented">invenio. Substance</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">hon</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> substance in the sense of riches. The radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hun</span>), from which it is derived, is the same as in the Arabic word, "to be light, easy, to be in easy circumstances, and so to be rich" (Gesenius). In its abstract sense, <span class="accented">hon</span>, "substance," means ease, comfort, and concretely riches which bring about that result (see also Fleischer, as quoted by Delitzsch); cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> collectively, possessions, property. The Piscatoris Version, for "precious substance," reads <span class="accented">divitias</span>, "riches." <span class="accented">Precious</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">yakar</span>), properly " heavy," is found with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hon</span>), "substance," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a> and Proverbs 24:4. The collocation of the ideas of lightness and heavineess in these two words is striking, but we need not necessarily suppose that any oxymoron is intended, as Schnltens. Such combinations occur in other languages, and reside more in the radical meanings of the words than in the mind or intention of the writer or speaker. <span class="cmt_word">We shall fill our houses with spoil</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they promise not only finding, but full possession (Gejerus, Muffet). <span class="accented">Spoil</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">shalal</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">shalal</span>), same as the Arabic verb "to draw," and hence "to strip off' (Gesenius); and equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), the arms stripped off a slain enemy, spoils, and the Latin <span class="accented">spolia</span> (Vulgate). <span class="accented">Shalal</span> is used generally, as here, for "prey," "booty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>). Our gains, say the robbers, will not only be valuable, but numerous and plentiful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-19 Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of the destroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?</body></html>
