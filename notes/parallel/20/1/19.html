The idea of greed and covetousness enters largely into the word. Which <span class="cmt_word">taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</span> The pronoun "which" does not occur in the original. The nominative to "taketh away" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">yikkath</span>) is "gain;" the "unjust gain." (<span class="accented">betsa</span>) takes away the life of its owners, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of those who are under its power. <span class="accented">Owners thereof</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">b'alayo</span>) does not necessarily imply that they are in actual possession of the unjust gain, but rather refers to the influence which the lust for gain exercises over them. The expression in this second hemistich does not mean that the rapacious take the life of their comrades who possess the gain, as Rabbi Salomon; nor as the Vulgate, "the ways of the avaricious man take away the lives of those who possess them." For the phrase, "taketh away the life," as importing a violent taking away, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>. The sentiment of the verse is well expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, "For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-19 Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of the destroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?</body></html>
