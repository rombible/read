The openings of the gates would be thronged, as courts of justice were held at the gates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2</a>); business was carried on there, as the selling and redemption of land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>); markets were also held there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1-18</a>); and the same localities were used for the councils of the state and conferences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-20.htm">Genesis 34:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-9.htm">2 Chronicles 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Jeremiah 17:19</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>:33, "Her husband is known in the <span class="accented">gates"</span>). In place of the expression, "in the openings of the gates," the LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "And at the gates of the mighty she sits" - an interpolation which only partially represents the sense of the original, and which is adopted in the Arabic. In the next clause, for "in the city" is substituted <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "at the gates of the city." The Vulgate combines the separate clauses of the original in one - in <span class="accented">foribus portarum urbis</span>, "in the entrances and openings of the gates of the city." <span class="cmt_word">In the city</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">bair</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the city itself (so Aben Ezra, ap. Gejerus), as opposed to the entrance by the gates, and so used antithetically (as Umbreit, Bertheau, Hitzig). The publicity of the teaching of Wisdom, observable in the places she selects for that purpose, also marked the public ministry of our Lord and his disciples, and finds an illustration in his command, "What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> give it all the publicity possible. The spirit of Wisdom, like that of Christianity, is aggressive (see Wardlaw, 'Lectures on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4.htm">Proverbs 4</a>,' vol. 1. pp. 40, 41). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
