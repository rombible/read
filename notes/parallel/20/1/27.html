The two leading ideas here in the writer's mind are calamity and fear. These - their fear, that which causes their fear; and their destruction, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> calamity - both representing Wisdom's, and so God's, judgment, will come on sinners as a wasting tempest and sweeping hurricane. The terror and devastation caused by these latter as they pass over the face of nature are employed to depict the alarm and ruin of sinners. <span class="cmt_word">Desolation</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">shaavah</span>) is a wasting, crashing tempest (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>), derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">shaah</span>). "to make a crash," as of a house falling. The Vulgate reads, <span class="accented">repentura calamitas</span>; the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; both bringing out the idea of suddenness, and the latter that of the uproar of the tempest. The Khetib, or traditional text of the manuscripts (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), is equivalent to the Keri, or emended reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), and both appear to have the same root meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Destruction</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, <span class="accented">eyd</span>); the same as "calamity ' in the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">Whirlwind</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (suphah), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">suph</span>), "to snatch, or carry away," means a whirlwind carrying everything before it - the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> of the LXX., or hurricane, as in Arist., 'Mund.,' 4, 16. Distress and anguish (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">tsarah v'tzukah</span>). A corresponding alliteration occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>. The root signification of the former is that of compression, reproduced in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">tribulatio</span>; that of the latter is narrowness. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "a beleaguering;" VUlgate, <span class="accented">angustga.</span> The LXX. adds, at the close of this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as explanatory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
