In the subsection the antecedent clauses are vers. 24, 25, introduced by the conjunction "because" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">yaan</span>; <span class="accented">quia</span>, Vulgate), which expresses the reason or cause for the conclusion in vers. 26 and 27, introduced by "I also," to which the "because" answers. A similar grammatical construction and judgment is to be found in Isaiah: "I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I Spake, they did not hear" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-4.htm">Isaiah 66:4</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>). <span class="accented">Refused</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> refused to hearken, as signified in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">I have stretched out my hand.</span> A forensic gesture to arrest attention. The expression is equivalent to "I have spread out my hands" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>); cf. "Then Paul stretched forth the hand (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-1.htm">Acts 26:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Regarded</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">mak'shiv</span>). The original idea of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">kashav</span>), used here, is that of erecting or pricking up the ear, like the Latin <span class="accented">arrigere</span>, sc<span class="accented">. aures</span>, in Plaut., 'Rud.,' 5, 2, 6; and cf. "arrectisque auribus adstant" (Virgil, 'AEneid,' 1:153). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
