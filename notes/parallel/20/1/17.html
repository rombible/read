Even birds are wiser than they. It is useless to spread a net in the sight of any bird.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely in vain the net is spread in the face of any bird.</span> The teacher here advances a <span class="accented">second</span> reason in support of his warning in ver. 15, under the form of a proverb in its strict sense. It is based on the ill-advised audacity of sinners in flying in the face of God's judgments. <span class="accented">In vain</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">khinnam</span>), see ver. 11, may be taken in two senses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to no purpose, <span class="accented">gratis, frustra</span> (Vulgate, Chaldee Paraphrase, Arabic). The meaning of the proverb here used then is, "to no purpose is the net spread before birds," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though they see the net spread before them, they nevertheless fly into it (romp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23</a>, "As a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life"). So sinners, when they are plotting for others, plunge into their own destruction with their eyes open. Therefore do not associate with them, do not imitate their crass folly, be warned by their example, or you will share their fate. This view is supported by the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For not unreasonably is the net spread before birds;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they fall into the snare (see Luther, Patrick, Umbreit, Ewatd, Hitzig, Zockler, Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others, as Delitzsch, Ziegler, Beda, Doderlein, Bertheau, Wardlaw, take <span class="accented">khinnam</span> in a different sense, as indicating the escape of the birds - the birds see the snare and fly away, and so in vain the net is spread in their sight. This explanation is in agreement with Ovid's statement, "Quae nimis apparent retia vitat avis." The moral motive put before youth in this case is the aggravation of his guilt if he listens to the enticements of sinners. The teacher seems to say, "Imitate the birds, flee from temptation; if you listen to sinners, you will sin with your eyes open." <span class="accented">Is spread</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">m</span> <span class="accented">zorah</span>)<span class="accented">, expansum</span>, not <span class="accented">conspersum est, i.e.</span> besprinkled or strewn with corn as a bait, as Rashi. <span class="accented">M'zorah</span> is the participle passive of pual, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zorah</span>), "to be strewn," from kal <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zarah</span>). "to scatter, or disperse" (Gesenius), and means <span class="accented">expansum</span>, because when a net is scattered or dispersed it is spread out (see Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Of any bird</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span> <span class="accented">khal-baal khanaph</span>); literally, <span class="accented">of every possessor of a wing</span>, or, as margin, <span class="accented">of everthing that hath a wing, i.e.</span> of every bird. Compare the same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">baal hach</span> <span class="accented">naphayim</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which hath wings" (Authorized Version). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-19 Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of the destroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?</body></html>
