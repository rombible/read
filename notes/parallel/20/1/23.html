The meaning seems to be "return to my reproof," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> place yourselves under my reproof (as Gejerus, Delitzsch), the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> Being represented by ad, as in the Vulgate: <span class="accented">convertimini ad correptionem meam</span>. It is susceptible, however, of a different reading, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in consequence of, or because of (<span class="accented">propter</span>), my reproof," the prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> being found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-34.htm">Numbers 16:34</a>, "They fled at the cry," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because of the cry. <span class="accented">Reproof</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">thochakhath</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rebuke, or correction, by words. The LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> conveys the argumentative conviction which will be present in the reproof. The word occurs again in vers. 23, 25, and 30 of this chapter, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-12.htm">Proverbs 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-15.htm">Proverbs 29:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you.</span> The promise consequent upon, and the encouragement to, repentance. The promise is conditioned - if those addressed will heed the reproof of Wisdom, then she will pour forth her Spirit upon them, and cause them to know her words The verb <span class="accented">hibbia</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span>), "to stream forth, or gush out," is here used figuratively. The outflow of the Spirit of Wisdom will be like the abundant and continuous gushing forth of water from the spring or fountain. The verb unites in it the figures of abundant fulness and refreshing invigoration (Umbreit, Elster); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-171.htm">Psalm 119:171</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:1</a>. We have here striking anticipation of the prophecy of Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). The Spirit is that of Wisdom "and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and godly strength, the Spirit of knowledge and true godliness" (see Confirmation Office). The explanation of Beda, that it signifies her anger, is clearly inadmissible. <span class="cmt_word">I will make known my words unto you;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the LXX., "I will teach you my word" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span>), or as the Vulgate "show" (<span class="accented">ostendam</span>), "expound, or make clear." <span class="accented">My words</span> (<span class="accented">d'vari</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> precepts, or doctrine, or secrets. An intimate relation subsists between the "Spirit" of Wisdom and her "words," with which it is parallel. The former is the illuminating, invigorating principle which infuses life and power into the "words" of Wisdom, which she has already given, and which are already in our possession. Wisdom stands in the same relation to her words as the Divine Logos does to his utterances, into which he infuses himself. "It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>. See Delitzsch, Wardlaw, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
