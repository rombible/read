The futures are resumed in the original from ver. 28. The word "therefore" does not occur, but it is met with in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>; in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">igitur</span>; and in the Syriac, <span class="accented">ideo.</span> The truth here expressed is accordant with the tenor of the teaching of the Scripture (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-14.htm">Proverbs 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7, 8</a>), and with our daily experience of God's moral government of the world (see Butler, 'Analogy,' part 1, ch. 2, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). This sentiment of retributive punishment also found expression in Terence, "Tute hoc intristi, tibi omne est edendum" ('Phorm.,' 2. 1. 4). When we are punished, the blameworthiness lies not with God, but with us sinners (Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be filled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">satiated</span>, or <span class="accented">surfeited</span>; <span class="accented">saturabuntur</span> (Vulgate). The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">shava</span>) means not only "to fill," but "to be satiated or cloyed" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-14.htm">Proverbs 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-16.htm">Proverbs 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>). Michaelis remarks on this word, "Ad nauseam implebuntur et comedent, ita ut consiliorum suorum vehementer tandem, sed nimis sero, ipsos poeniteat" (Michaelis, 'Notre Uberiores in Prov.'), "They shall be filled and eat <span class="accented">ad nauseam</span>, so that at length, but too late, they shall vehemently repent them of their own counsels." <span class="cmt_word">Counsels</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">moetsoth</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ungodly counsels, or evil devices. The word only occurs in the plural. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
