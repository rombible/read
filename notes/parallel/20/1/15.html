The warning is practically a repetition of ver. 10, and is given again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14</a>, "Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men." <span class="accented">Way</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">derek</span>) means, figuratively, the way of living and acting (Gesenius). "Mores et consuetudines" (Bayne); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>, "the fool's way;" 22:25; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. The meaning is "associate not with them, have no dealings whatever with them." <span class="cmt_word">Refrain thy foot from their path;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> keep back thy foot, or make not one step in compliance, resist the very first solicitations to evil. Compare the legal maxim, <span class="accented">Initiis obsta. Refrain</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">m'na</span>) is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">mana</span>), "to keep back, restrain;' LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-101.htm">Psalm 119:101</a>, "I have refrained my feet from every evil way;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-10.htm">Jeremiah 14:10</a>, "Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet"). Restraining the foot carries with it indirectly the natural inclination or propensity of the heart, even of the good, towards evil (Cartwright). <span class="accented">Foot</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">regel</span>) is, of course, used metaphorically, and means less the member of the body than the idea suggested by it; hence the use of the singular (Gejerus, Delitzsch). Bayne remarks that the Hebrews understood this passage as meaning "neither in public nor private life have any dealings with sinners." <span class="accented">Path</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">nathiv</span>) is a beaten path, a pathway, a byway; from the unused root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">nathav</span>), "to tread, trample;" and hence, while "way" may mean the great public high road, "path" may stand for the bypath, less frequented or public. The same distinction probably occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a>, "Show me thy ways, O Lord; and teach me thy paths." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-19 Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of the destroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?</body></html>
