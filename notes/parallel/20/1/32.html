Version); the "backsliding" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>. Abea Ezra understands it to signify "ease," as in the marginal reading; but there seems no warrant for taking the word in that sense. The LXX. renders the passage quite differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> "For because they wronged the young, they shall be slain;" so also the Arabic. The turning away is from the warnings and invitations of Wisdom, and implies <span class="accented">rebelliousness</span> against God. <span class="cmt_word">The prosperity</span>. The word in the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">shal'vah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> here used in a bad sense, and means "carelessness, indolence," that carnal security which is induced by prosperity and worldly success, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-21.htm">Jeremiah 22:21</a>, "I spoke to thee in thy prosperity (security), but thou saidst, I will not hear" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>, where it is translated "idleness." So Dathe translates, "Incuria ignavorum eos perdit." The Chaldee Paraphrase and Syriac Versions read "error." It occurs in a good sense as "tranquillity," "security," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>. The derivation of the word is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">shalah</span>). "to be tranquil, to be safe, secure." Marines remarks that it is more difficult to bear prosperity than adversity, because we endure adversity, we are corrupted by prosperity, and prosperity or ease makes fools mad. The false security of the prosperous is illustrated by our Lord in his parable of the rich fool (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>). The LXX. differs again from the Hebrew in the second clause of this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the carefully considered judgment of God concerning them shall destroy them. The LXX, is followed by the Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">Them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fools themselves, and not other sinners, as Ben Ezra says, though the apparent security of fools, the impunity with which they seem to go on in their wickedness, and the success of their plans, may lead others to destruction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-33 Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
