The enticement here put before youth is the courage and boldness of their exploits (Wardlaw). The order of the words in the original is, "Let us swallow them up, as the grave, living," which sufficiently indicates the meaning of the passage. <span class="accented">Alive</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">khayyim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> "the living," refers to the pronomiual suffix in <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">niv'laem</span>), as in the Authorized Version and Zockler (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-3.htm">Psalm 124:3</a>). Umbreit and Hitzig are grammatically incorrect in connecting <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">kish'ol</span>) "as the grave," with "the living," and translating "like the pit (swallows) that which lives." The <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;</span> (<span class="accented">ki</span>) with a substantive, as here in <span class="accented">kish'ol</span>, is a preposition, said not a conjunction (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon'). It denotes a kind of resemblance, but does not introduce a coordinate sentence. The allusion is undoubtedly in the teacher's mind to the fate of Korah and his company (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30-33</a>), and as in that case "the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up" in the flush of life, so here the robbers say that they will as suddenly and effectively destroy their victims, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">dala</span>); from which <span class="accented">niv'laem</span>, in a figurative sense, means "to destroy utterly" (Geseuius). The change from the singular, "the innocent" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">l'naki</span>), to the plural in "let us swallow <span class="accented">them</span> up," is noticeable. <span class="accented">Like the pit</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">kish'ol</span>); literally, <span class="accented">like Sheol</span>, or <span class="accented">Hades</span>, the great subterranean cavity or world of the dead. The all-devouring and insatiable character of sheol is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>, where the Authorized Version translates "Hell (<span class="accented">sheol</span>) and destruction are never full," and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>, where it (<span class="accented">sheol</span>, Authorized Version, "the grave") is classed with the four things that are never satisfied. Vulgate, <span class="accented">infernus</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. And whole, as those that go down into the pit. The parallelism of ideas requires that the word "whole" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">t'mimim</span>) should be understood of those physically whole (see Mercerus, Delitzsch), and not in a moral sense, as the <span class="accented">upright</span> (Luther, Grief, Holden, Plumptre). The word is used in an ethical signification in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a>. Gesenius gives it the meaning of "safe, secure." <span class="accented">Those that go down into the pit</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">yorde vor</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dead. The phrase also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-7.htm">Psalm 143:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>). <span class="accented">The pit</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">vor</span>); or, <span class="accented">the sepulchre</span>, the receptacle of the dead, is here synonymous with <span class="accented">sheol.</span> The LXX. substitutes for the latter part of the verse, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "And let us remove his memory from the earth." The robbers, by drawing a comparison between themselves and Hades and the grave, which consign to silence all who are put therein, imply their own security against detection. They will so utterly destroy their victims that none will be left to tell the tale (see Musset, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). This, we know, is a fancied, and at the best only a temporary, security. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-19 Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of the destroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?</body></html>
