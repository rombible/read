The transition in this verse from what may be regarded as filial obedience towards God to filial obedience towards parents is suggestive of the moral Law. The same admonition, in a slightly altered form, occurs again in ch. 6, "My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>). <span class="accented">My son</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">b'ni</span>) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ben</span>), "a son." The form of address here adopted was that in common use by teachers towards their pupils, and marks that superintending, loving, and fatherly care and interest which the former felt in and towards the latter. It occurs frequently in the introductory section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-1.htm">Proverbs 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>), and reappears again towards the close (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15, 19, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-11.htm">Proverbs 27:11</a>) in the teacher's address. The mother of Lemuel uses it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>) in the strictly parental sense. In other passages of the Old Testament the teacher, on the other hand, is represented as a "father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-21.htm">2 Kings 2:21</a>). We find the same relation assumed in the New Testament, both by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>) and by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-2.htm">1 John 5:2</a>); but under the economy of the gospel it has a deeper significance than here, as pointing to the "new birth," which, being a later revelation, lies outside the scope of the moral teaching of the Old Testament dispensation. <span class="accented">The instruction</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="accented">musar</span>); as carrying with it the sense of disciplinary education (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">disciplina</span>; see also ver. 2), and of the correction with which it may be enforced (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13, 14</a>), the writer attributes appropriately to the father, while the milder <span class="accented">torah</span>, "law," he uses of the mother (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Father</span>. The nature of the exhortation conveyed in this verse requires that we should understand the terms "father" and "mother" in their natural sense as designating the parents of the persons addressed, though a symbolical meaning has Been attached to them by the rabbis (see Rabbi Salomon, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.), "father" being understood as representing God, and "mother," the people. But the terms are more than merely figurative expressions (Stuart). Those who look upon the Proverbs as the address of Solomon to his son Rehoboam naturally take "father" as standing for the former. Naamah, in this case must be the mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>). It is almost unnecessary to state that pious parents are presupposed, and that only that instruction and law can be meant which is not inconsistent with the higher and more perfect Law of God (Gejerus, Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">And forsake not the law of thy mother.</span> <span class="accented">Forsake.</span> The radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">tittosh</span>) is that of "spreading," then of "scattering" (Aiken), and so the word comes to mean "forsake, reject, or neglect." The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">abjicere</span>, "to push away, reject." Cf. <span class="accented">abjicias</span> (Arabic). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">dimittas, i.e.</span> "abandon," and the Syriac, <span class="accented">obliviscaris, i.e.</span> "forget." <span class="accented">The law</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">torath</span>), construct case of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">torah</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">yarah</span>), "to teach," hence here equivalent to "a law" in the sense of that which teaches - a precept (<span class="accented">doctrina</span>, Jun. et Tremell., Piscat., Castal., Versions). With one exception (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>), it is the term which always expresses the instruction given by Wisdom (Delitzsch). The law (<span class="accented">torah</span>) of the mother is that preceptive teaching which she imparts orally to her son, but <span class="accented">torah</span> is also used in a technical sense as <span class="accented">lex</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, that which is laid down and established, a <span class="accented">decretum</span> or <span class="accented">institutum</span>, and designates some distinct provision or ordinance, as the law of sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-7.htm">Leviticus 6:7</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a> we find it employed to signify the whole body of the Mosaic Law (<span class="accented">sepher hatorah</span>)<span class="accented">. Mother.</span> Not inserted here as a natural expansion of the idea of the figure required by the laws of poetic parallelism (as Zockler), since this weakens the force of the passage. Mothers are mentioned because of their sedulousness in imparting instruction (Bayne). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-9 Fools are persons who have no true wisdom, who follow their own devices, without regard to reason, or reverence for God. Children are reasonable creatures, and when we tell them what they must do, we must tell them why. But they are corrupt and wilful, therefore with the instruction there is need of a law. Let Divine truths and commands be to us most honourable; let us value them, and then they shall be so to us.</body></html>
