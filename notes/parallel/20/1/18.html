"Lay wait," and "lurk privily," as in ver. 11, from which this verse is evidently borrowed. They propose, as they say, to lay wait for the blood of others; but it is, says the teacher, for their own blood. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">l'dhammam</span>), <span class="accented">contra sanguinem suum</span>; they lurk privily. as they say, for the innocent, but in reality it is for their own lives; <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">l'naph'shotham</span>); <span class="accented">contra animus suas</span> (Vulgate); or, as the LXX. puts it, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>, "For they who take part in murder treasure up evils for themselves;" that is, they am bringing a heavier and surer destruction upon themselves than they can ever inflict upon others (Wardlaw). The LXX. adds, at the close of the verse, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>, "And the overthrowing or destruction of transgressors is wrest, or evil." The Arabic Version has a similar addition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-19 Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of the destroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?</body></html>
