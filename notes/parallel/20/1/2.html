"To know" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">ladaath</span>) is somewhat indefinite in the Authorized Version, and might be more accurately rendered. "from which men may know" (De Wette, Noyes); cf. <span class="accented">unde scias</span> (Munsterus). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> which is here prefixed to the infinitive, as in vers. 2, 8, and 6, gives the clause a final character, and thus points out the object which the teaching of the Proverbs has in view. The teaching is viewed from the standpoint of the learner, and hence what is indicated here is not the imparting of knowledge, but the reception or aprrspriation thereof on the part of the laemer. Schultens states that the radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">daath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the reception of knowledge into one's self. <span class="accented">Wisdom.</span> It will be necessary to go rather fully into this word here on its first appearance in the text. The Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">khokhmah</span>). Wisdom is mentioned first, because it is the end to which all knowledge and instruction tend. The fundamental conception of the word is variously represented as either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the "power of judging," derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span>, "to be wise," from the Arabic, "to judge" (Oesenlus); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the fixing of a thing for cognition," derived from the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, as before, which signifies "to fasten" (Zockler), or "compactness," from the same root as before, "to be firm, or closed." It is also variously defined <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as "<span class="accented">insight</span> into that upright dealing which pleases God - a <span class="accented">knowledge</span> of the right way which is to be followed before God, and of the wrong one which is to be shunned" (Zockler); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as "piety towards God," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a> (Gesenius); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as "the knowledge of things in their being and in the reality of their existence" (Delitzsch), The word is translated in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">sapientia.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">khokhmah</span> and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> so far agree as philosophical terms in that the end of each is the same, viz. the striving after objective wisdom, the moral fitness of things; but the character of the former differs from that of the latter in being distinctly religious. The beginning and the end of the <span class="accented">khokhmah</span>, wisdom, is God (cf. ver. 7). Wisdom, then, is not the merely scientific knowledge, or moral philosophy, but knowledge <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> religious knowledge or piety towards God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an appreciation of what God requires of us and what we conversely owe to God. "Sapientia est de divinis" (Lyra). Wisdom will, of course, carry with it the notions of knowledge and insight. <span class="accented">Instruction.</span> As the preceding word represents wisdom in its intellectual conception, and has rather a theoretical character, so "instruction," Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>), represents it on its practical side, and as such is its practical complement. The Hebrew <span class="accented">musar</span> signifies properly "chastisement," from the root <span class="accented">yasar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), "to correct," or "chastise," and hence education, moral training; and hence in the LXX. it is rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, which means both the process of education (cf. Plato, 'Repub.,' 376, E.; Arist., 'Pol.,' 8, 3) and its result as learning (Plato, 'Prob.,' 327, D.). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">disciplina.</span> In relation to wisdom, it is antecedent to it; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to know wisdom truly we must first become acquainted with instruction, and hence it is a preparatory step to the knowledge of wisdom, though here it is stated rather objectively. The words, "wisdom and instruction," are found in exactly the same collocation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-13.htm">Proverbs 4:13</a> and Proverbs 23:23. In its strictly disciplinary sense, "instruction" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>, with which comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>. Holden takes this word as "moral discipline" in the highest sense. <span class="cmt_word">To perceive the words of understanding;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to discern the words of discernment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to comprehend the utterances which proceed from intelligence, and give expression to it" (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">vinah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), connected with the hiph. (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">l'havin</span>), properly "to distinguish," hence "to discern," of the same clause, signifies the capability of discerning the true from the false, good front bad, etc. With this agrees Cornelius a Lapide, who says, "Unde prudenter discernas inter bonum et malum, licitum et illicitum, utile et noxium, verum et falsum," and from which you are enabled to know what to do in any circumstances, and what not to do. The LXX. renders the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate by <span class="accented">prudentia.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in Plato and Aristotle, is the virtue concerned in the government of men, manage-merit of affairs, and the like (see Plato, 'Sym.,' 209, A.; Arist.,' Eth.,' N. 6, 5 and 8), and means practical wisdom, prudence, or moral wisdom. Van Ess, Allioli, Holden, translate "prudence." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-6 The lessons here given are plain, and likely to benefit those who feel their own ignorance, and their need to be taught. If young people take heed to their ways, according to Solomon's Proverbs, they will gain knowledge and discretion. Solomon speaks of the most important points of truth, and a greater than Solomon is here. Christ speaks by his word and by his Spirit. Christ is the Word and the Wisdom of God, and he is made to us wisdom.</body></html>
