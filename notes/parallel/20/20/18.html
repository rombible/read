The Talmud says, "Even the most prudent of men needs friends' counsels;" and none but the most conceited would deem himself superior to advice, or would fail to allow that, as the Vulgate puts it, <span class="accented">cogitationes consillis roborantur.</span> This is true in all relations of life, in great and small matters alike, in peace, and, as our moralist adds, in war. <span class="cmt_word">With good advice make war;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Gubernaculis tractanda sunt bella</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">By wise guidance make thou war</span>. The word here used is <span class="accented">takebuloth</span>, for which see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>. It is a maritime metaphor, rightly retained by the Vulgate, and might be rendered "pilotings," "steerings." War is a necessary evil, but it must be undertaken prudently and with a due consideration of circumstances, means, etc. Our Lord illustrates the necessity of due circumspection in following him by the case of a threatened conflict between two contending kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-31.htm">Luke 14:31</a>, etc.). Grotius quotes the gnome - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Titan strength of hands availeth counsel more."</span> To which we may add - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Good counsel is the safest thing of all."</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-6.htm">Proverbs 24:6</a>, where the hemistich is re-echoed.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:7. A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.</body></html>
