So the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> in one clause and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the other. The proverb says that the steps of a great and powerful man depend, as their final cause, upon the Lord; he conditions and controls results. Man has free will, and is responsible for his actions, but God foreknows them, and holds the thread that connects them together; he gives preventing grace; he gives efficient grace: and man blindly works out the designs of Omnipotence according as he obeys or resists. A similar maxim is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>, "A man's goings are established of the Lord," but the meaning there is that it is God's aid which enables a man to do certain actions. Here we have very much the same intimation that is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> and Proverbs 19:21; and see note on Proverbs 16:9. Hence arises the old prayer used formerly at prime, and inserted now (with some omissions) at the end of the Anglican Communion Service: "O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies, our thoughts, words, and actions, in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through thy most mighty protection we may be preserved both here and forever." If man cannot see all sides, as God does, cannot comprehend the beginning, middle, and end in one view, how then can a man (a weak mortal) understand his own ways. How can he find out of himself whither he should go, or what will be the issue of his doings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>)? St. Gregory, "It is well said by Solomon [<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>], 'There are righteous and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God; and yet no man knoweth whether he is deserving of love or of hatred; but all things are kept uncertain for the time to come.' Hence it is said again by the same Solomon, 'What man will be able to understand his own way?' And any one doing good or evil is doubtless known by the testimony of his own conscience. But it is said that their own way is not known to men, for this reason, because, even if a man understands that he is acting rightly, yet he knows not, under the strict inquiry, whither he is going" ('Moral.,' 29:34). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:23. A bargain made by fraud will prove a losing bargain in the end. 24. How can we form plans, and conduct business, independently of the Lord? 25. The evasions men often use with their own consciences show how false and deceitful man is. 26. Justice should crush the wicked, and separate them from the virtuous. 27. The rational soul and conscience are as a lamp within us, which should be used in examining our dispositions and motives with the revealed will of God. 28. Mercy and truth are the glories of God's throne. 29. Both young and old have their advantages; and let neither despise or envy the other.</body></html>
