The terror which a king causes when his anger is rising is like the roar of a lion, which betokens danger. Septuagint, "The threat of a king differeth not from the wrath of a lion." Whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul; imperils his life, which he has no right wilfully to jeopard. Septuagint, "He who enrageth him (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)."

How formidable kings are to those who provoke them! how much more foolish then is it to provoke the King of kings! 3. To engage in quarrels is the greatest folly that can be. Yield, and even give up just demands, for peace' sake. 4. He who labours and endures hardship in his seed-time for eternity, will be properly diligent as to his earthly business.</body></html>
