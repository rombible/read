A sort of sledge or cart was driven over the stalks of corn spread upon the threshing-floor, by means of which the grain was separated from the husk. A wise king winnows out evil persons from among his people, thus putting an end to their corrupting influence. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wise king scattereth the wicked</span> (ver. 8). The verb is <span class="accented">zarah</span>, which means "to winnow, or sift." The king separates the wicked and the good, as the winnowing fan or shovel divides the chaff from the wheat. The same metaphor is used of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>), "Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>). Septuagint, "A winnower (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>) of the ungodly is a wise king." <span class="cmt_word">And bringeth the wheel over them.</span> The threshing wheel is meant (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). This was a wooden frame with three or four rollers under it armed with iron teeth. It was drawn by two oxen, and, aided by the weight of the driver, who had his seat upon it, it crushed out the grain, and cut up the straw into fodder. Another machine much used in Palestine was made of two thick planks fastened together side by side, and having sharp stones fixed in rows on the lower surface. It is not implied that the king employed the corn drag as an instrument of punishment, which was sometimes so used in war, as possibly may be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. The idea of threshing is carried on, and the notion is rather of separation than of punishment, though the latter is not wholly excluded. The wise ruler will not only distinguish between the godless and the good, but will show his discrimination by visiting the evil with condign puuishment. Septuagint, "He will bring the wheel upon them;" the Vulgate has curiously, <span class="accented">Incurvat super eos fornicem</span>, "He bends an arch over them," which Latin commentators explain as a triumphal arch, meaning that the king conquers and subdues the wicked, and celebrates his victory over them. A patent anachronism which needs no comment! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:23. A bargain made by fraud will prove a losing bargain in the end. 24. How can we form plans, and conduct business, independently of the Lord? 25. The evasions men often use with their own consciences show how false and deceitful man is. 26. Justice should crush the wicked, and separate them from the virtuous. 27. The rational soul and conscience are as a lamp within us, which should be used in examining our dispositions and motives with the revealed will of God. 28. Mercy and truth are the glories of God's throne. 29. Both young and old have their advantages; and let neither despise or envy the other.</body></html>
