The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Ruina est homini devorare sanctos</span>, which is explained to mean that it is destruction for a man to persecute the saints of God. But the word <span class="accented">devorare</span> is not certain, as the manuscripts vary between this and four other readings, viz. <span class="accented">devotares, denotare, devovere</span>, and <span class="accented">devocare.</span> The Authorized Version signifies that it is a sin to take for one's own consumption things dedicated to God, as firstfruits, the priests' portions, etc.: or a man's snare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his covetousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), leads him to commit sacrilege. So Wordsworth. But it is best, with Delitzsch, to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">yala</span>) as the abbreviated future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, "to speak rashly;" and then <span class="accented">kodesh</span>, "holiness," will be an exclamation, like <span class="accented">korban</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a>). The clause will then run, "It is a snare to a man rashly to cry, Holiness!" equivalent to "It is holy!" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to use the formula for consecrating something to holy purposes. Septuagint, "It is a snare to a man hastily to consecrate something of his own" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2, 4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And after vows to make inquiry;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after he has made his vow, to begin to consider whether he can fulfil it or not. This is a snare to a man, strangles his conscience, and leads him into the grievous sins of perjury and sacrilege. Septuagint, "For after vowing ensueth repentance." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:23. A bargain made by fraud will prove a losing bargain in the end. 24. How can we form plans, and conduct business, independently of the Lord? 25. The evasions men often use with their own consciences show how false and deceitful man is. 26. Justice should crush the wicked, and separate them from the virtuous. 27. The rational soul and conscience are as a lamp within us, which should be used in examining our dispositions and motives with the revealed will of God. 28. Mercy and truth are the glories of God's throne. 29. Both young and old have their advantages; and let neither despise or envy the other.</body></html>
