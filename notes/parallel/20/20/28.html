So (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm" title="But there is forgiveness with you, that you may be feared.">Psalm 130:4</a>) the mercy shown by God inspires man with a reverent fear of Him, while harshness might have made him a slave, or driven him through despair into rebellion.

The love and faithfulness which the king displays in dealing with his subjects elicits the like virtues in them, and these are the safeguard of his throne. <span class="cmt_word">His throne is upholden by mercy;</span> or, <span class="accented">love.</span> So the king is well called the father of his people, and in modern times the epithet "gracious" is applied to the sovereign as being the fountain of mercy and condescension. Sallust, 'Jugurtha,' 10, "Non exercitus neque thesauri praesidia regni sunt, verum amici, quos neque armis cogere neque auro parare queas; officio et fide pariuntur." Septuagint, "Mercy (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) and truth are a guard to a king, and will surround his throne with righteousness." "The subject's love," says our English maxim, "is the king's lifeguard." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:23. A bargain made by fraud will prove a losing bargain in the end. 24. How can we form plans, and conduct business, independently of the Lord? 25. The evasions men often use with their own consciences show how false and deceitful man is. 26. Justice should crush the wicked, and separate them from the virtuous. 27. The rational soul and conscience are as a lamp within us, which should be used in examining our dispositions and motives with the revealed will of God. 28. Mercy and truth are the glories of God's throne. 29. Both young and old have their advantages; and let neither despise or envy the other.</body></html>
