With the attire of an harlot. There is no "with" in the original, "woman" and "attire" being in apposition: "There met him a woman, a harlot's dress" (<span class="accented">shith</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a>); her attire catches the eye at once, and identifies her (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a> the harlot is "arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls;" and in the present case the female is dressed in some conspicuous garments, very different from the sober clothing of the pure and modest.

The versions have used a different reading. Thus the Septuagint: "Who makes the hearts of young men flutter (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">praeparata ad capiendas animas</span>, "ready to catch souls." Vers. 11 and 12 describe the character and habits of this woman, not as she appeared on this occasion, but as she is known to the writer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:6-27 Here is an affecting example of the danger of youthful lusts. It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.</body></html>
