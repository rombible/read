The expression occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22</a>. It is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> "to spread," and means cushions spread out ready for use. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">funibus</span>, "cords." These versions seem to regard the word as denoting a kind of delicate sacking on which the coverlets were laid. <span class="cmt_word">Carved works, with fine linen of Egypt;</span> literally, <span class="accented">striped, or variegated, coverings, Egyptian linen.</span> The words are in apposition, but the latter point to the material used, which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">etun</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), "linen yarn or thread," hence equivalent to "coverlets of Egyptian thread." This was of extreme fineness, costly, and much prized. By "carved works" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">chatuboth</span>) the Authorized Version must refer to bed poles or bed boards elaborately carved and polished; but the word is better taken of coverlets striped in different colours, which give the idea of richness and luxury. Vulgate, <span class="accented">trapetibus pictis ex Aegypto</span>, "embroidered rugs of Egyptian work;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "shaggy cloth of Egypt." The mention of these articles denotes the foreign commerce of the Hebrews, and their appreciation of artistic work (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-9.htm">Isaiah 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>). The Prophet Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>) denounces those that "lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:6-27 Here is an affecting example of the danger of youthful lusts. It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.</body></html>
