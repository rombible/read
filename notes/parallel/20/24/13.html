It was especially used for children's food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>), and thus becomes an emblem of the purest wisdom. "I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey," says the lover in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>; and the psalmist says that the ordinances of the Lord are "sweeter than honey and the honeycomb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>; see on Proverbs 25:16). Palestine was a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>); hence is derived the continual reference to this article of diet in the Bible. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1,2 Envy not sinners. And let not a desire ever come into thy mind, Oh that I could shake off restraints! 3-6. Piety and prudence in outward affairs, both go together to complete a wise man. By knowledge the soul is filled with the graces and comforts of the spirit, those precious and pleasant riches. The spirit is strengthened for the spiritual work and the spiritual warfare, by true wisdom. 7-9. A weak man thinks wisdom is too high for him, therefore he will take no pains for it. It is bad to do evil, but worse to devise it. Even the first risings of sin in the heart are sin, and must be repented of. Those that strive to make others hateful, make themselves so. 10. Under troubles we are apt to despair of relief. But be of good courage, and God shall strengthen thy heart. 11,12. If a man know that his neighbour is in danger by any unjust proceeding, he is bound to do all in his power to deliver him. And what is it to suffer immortal souls to perish, when our persuasions and example may be the means of preventing it? 13,14. We are quickened to the study of wisdom by considering both the pleasure and the profit of it. All men relish things that are sweet to the palate; but many have no relish for the things that are sweet to the purified soul, and that make us wise unto salvation. 15,16. The sincere soul falls as a traveller may do, by stumbling at some stone in his path; but gets up, and goes on his way with more care and speed. This is rather to be understood of falls into affliction, than falls into actual sin.</body></html>
