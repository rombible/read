The following proverbs, as well as the preceding, are derived from wise men. Mistaking this superscription, the LXX. makes it a personal address: "This I say to you who are wise, so that ye may learn." The first line is not a proverb, but the introduction to the ensuing collection. <span class="cmt_word">It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>, and note there; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-21.htm">Proverbs 28:21</a>, where the expression is the same as here). To regard one person before another is to be partial and unjust. To say this error is "not good" is a meiosis, the meaning being that it is very evil and sinful (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>).
