In the spiritual life, too, we should seek to "perceive and know what things we ought to do," if we are not to waste time and energy upon unsuitable and unattainable objects.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepare thy work without.</span> The proverb enjoins a man to look well to his resources before he undertakes to build a house or to establish a family. "Without" (<span class="accented">chuts</span>) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-26.htm">Proverbs 8:26</a>); in the fields. Put in due order all immediate work in thy farm. <span class="cmt_word">And make it fit for thyself in the field;</span> and get ready for what has to come next. That is, in short, steadily and with due foresight cultivate your land; provide abundant means of subsistence before you attempt to build up your house. A suitor had, as it were, to purchase his bride from her relations by making considerable presents; it was therefore necessary to provide a certain amount of wealth before contemplating matrimony. <span class="cmt_word">And afterwards build thy house.</span> This is, indeed, the meaning of the passage; but the Hebrew makes a difficulty, as it is literally, "afterwards and thou shalt build." Some have supposed that some words have dropped out of the text (Cheyne, 'Job and Solomon'). But <span class="accented">vav</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;</span>, coming after a date or notification of time, as here after <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>), "has the future signification of a perfect consecutive" (Delitzsch), equivalent to "after that, then, thou mayest build." Septuagint, "Prepare thy works for thy going forth (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x2c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and get ready for the field, and come after me, and thou shalt build up thine house." In a spiritual sense, the heart must be first cleared of thorns, and opened to genial influences, before the man can build up the fabric of virtuous habits, and thus arrive at the virtuous character. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:17,18. The pleasure we are apt to take in the troubles of an enemy is forbidden. 19,20. Envy not the wicked their prosperity; be sure there is no true happiness in it. 21,22. The godly in the land, will be quiet in the land. There may be cause to change for the better, but have nothing to do with them that are given change. 23-26. The wisdom God giveth, renders a man fit for his station. Every one who finds the benefit of the right answer, will be attached to him that gave it. 27. We must prefer necessaries before conveniences, and not go in debt.</body></html>
