Wordsworth renders, "the stroke of vengeance from them both," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from God and the king. Otherwise, we must give another signification to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span>, and, with the Syriac and many modern commentators, take it in the sense of "years," which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> will bear, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-11.htm">Job 36:11</a>, and translate, "The destruction [equivalent to 'end'] of their years, who knoweth?" No one can tell when the crisis of their fate shall come; but it will arrive some day, and then the time of their prosperity will be at an end. Septuagint, "For they (God and the king) will suddenly punish the ungodly; and who shall know the vengeance of both (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)?" After this the LXX. inserts three proverbs not found now in the Hebrew, which, however, Ewald ('Jahrb. der Bibl. Wissensch.,' 11:17, etc.) considers to have been translated from a Hebrew original: "A son that keepeth the commandment shall be safe from destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-27.htm">Proverbs 29:27</a>, Vulgate), and he hath fully received it (the word). Let no lie be spoken by the tongue of the king; and no he shall proceed from his tongue. The king's tongue is a sword, and not of flesh; and whosoever shall be delivered unto it shall be destroyed; for if his anger be inflamed, he consumes men with their nerves, and devours men's bones, and burns them up as a flame, so that they are not food for the young eagles." The allusion at the end is to animals killed by lightning. Here follows the series of proverbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1-14</a>) called in the Hebrew, "The words of Agur." The second part of "the words of Agur," and "the words of Lemuel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-31:9</a>) follow in the Greek after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-34.htm">Proverbs 24:34</a> of the Hebrew. Delitzsch explains the matter thus: In the copy from which the Alexandrines translated, the appendix (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30-31:9</a>) was divided into two parts, half of it standing after "the words of the wise" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17-24:22</a>), and half after the supplement containing further sayings of wise men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23-34</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:17,18. The pleasure we are apt to take in the troubles of an enemy is forbidden. 19,20. Envy not the wicked their prosperity; be sure there is no true happiness in it. 21,22. The godly in the land, will be quiet in the land. There may be cause to change for the better, but have nothing to do with them that are given change. 23-26. The wisdom God giveth, renders a man fit for his station. Every one who finds the benefit of the right answer, will be attached to him that gave it. 27. We must prefer necessaries before conveniences, and not go in debt.</body></html>
