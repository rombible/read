St. Jerome makes the excuse to be inability, <span class="accented">vires</span> <span class="accented">non suppetunt</span>. The LXX. makes it a personal matter, ignoring the plural form of the previous paragraph. "I know him not, he is no friend of mine; why should I trouble myself about him?" Such a selfish person, like the priest and Levite in the parable, would "pass by on the other side." <span class="cmt_word">Doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it?</span> God knows the truth - knows that the excuse is vain; for he is the Weigher and Searcher of hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>). Cain's plea, "Am I my brother's keeper?" is unavailable; the law of love is limited by no circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">He that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?</span> The expression, "keeping the soul," may be equivalent to "preserving the life;" but it more probably means watching, observing, the inmost secrets of the nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>). The verb used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">natsar</span>), which has both significations. The sense of "forming." which some give it, seems not allowable. (For "heart" (<span class="accented">leb</span>) and "soul" (<span class="accented">nephesh</span>), see note on Proverbs 2:10.) <span class="cmt_word">Shall not he render to every man according to his works?</span> Knowing the heart and the motive, God deals out retributive justice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>). Septuagint, "But if thou say, I know not this man, know that the Lord knoweth the hearts of air; and he who formed (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) breath for all, himself knoweth all things, who rendereth to every man according to his works." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1,2 Envy not sinners. And let not a desire ever come into thy mind, Oh that I could shake off restraints! 3-6. Piety and prudence in outward affairs, both go together to complete a wise man. By knowledge the soul is filled with the graces and comforts of the spirit, those precious and pleasant riches. The spirit is strengthened for the spiritual work and the spiritual warfare, by true wisdom. 7-9. A weak man thinks wisdom is too high for him, therefore he will take no pains for it. It is bad to do evil, but worse to devise it. Even the first risings of sin in the heart are sin, and must be repented of. Those that strive to make others hateful, make themselves so. 10. Under troubles we are apt to despair of relief. But be of good courage, and God shall strengthen thy heart. 11,12. If a man know that his neighbour is in danger by any unjust proceeding, he is bound to do all in his power to deliver him. And what is it to suffer immortal souls to perish, when our persuasions and example may be the means of preventing it? 13,14. We are quickened to the study of wisdom by considering both the pleasure and the profit of it. All men relish things that are sweet to the palate; but many have no relish for the things that are sweet to the purified soul, and that make us wise unto salvation. 15,16. The sincere soul falls as a traveller may do, by stumbling at some stone in his path; but gets up, and goes on his way with more care and speed. This is rather to be understood of falls into affliction, than falls into actual sin.</body></html>
