The stinging nettle is quite common in Palestine, but the plant here meant is probably the prickly acanthus, which quickly covers any spot left uncultivated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>). Revised Version margin suggests wild vetches. Ovid, 'Trist.,' 5:12. 21 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Adde, quod ingenium louga rubigine laesum<br />Torpet, et est multo, quam fuitante, minus.<br />Fertilis, assiduo si non renovetur aratro,<br />Nil, nisicum spinis gramen, habebit ager."</span> So spiritual writers have used this apologue as teaching a lesson concerning the soul and the life of man, how that spiritual sloth allows the growth of evil habits, and the carelessness which maintains not the defence of law and prayer, but admits the enemy, and the result is the loss of the true riches and the perishing of the heavenly life. The two verses are thus rendered, or morally applied, in the Septuagint: "A foolish man is as a farm. and a man wanting in sense is as a vineyard; if you leave him, he will be barren, and will be altogether covered with weeds, and he will become deserted, and his fences of stone are broken down." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:30-34. See what a blessing the husbandman's calling is, and what a wilderness this earth would be without it. See what great difference there is in the management even of worldly affairs. Sloth and self-indulgence are the bane of all good. When we see fields overgrown with thorns and thistles, and the fences broken down, we see an emblem of the far more deplorable state of many souls. Every vile affection grows in men's hearts; yet they compose themselves to sleep. Let us show wisdom by doubling our diligence in every good thing.</body></html>
