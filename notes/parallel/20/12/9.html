And David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?">1Samuel 18:23</a>); if "he hath a servant," that is, if he be in easy circumstances. It has been remarked that "the first necessity of an Oriental in only moderate circumstances is a slave."<p><span class= "bld">He that honoureth himself.</span>--Boasts of his pedigree, it may be, and is all the while starving.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This verse may be translated, <span class="accented">Better is a man who is lightly esteemed and hath a slave, than he that boasts himself and lacketh bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man who is thought little of by his fellows, and is lowly in his own eyes, if he have a slave to minister to his wants (which all Orientals of even moderate wealth possess), is better off than one who boasts of his rank and family, and is all the while on the verge of starvation. "Respectful mediocrity is better than boastful poverty." Ecclus. 10:27, "Better is he that laboreth and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread." But the words rendered, <span class="cmt_word">hath a slave,</span> are literally, <span class="accented">a servant to himself.</span> So the Vulgate has, <span class="accented">sufficiens sibi</span>, "sufficing himself," and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "serving himself." And the expression implies attending to his own concerns, supplying his own wants. Hence the gnome means, "It is wiser to look after one's own business and provide for one's own necessities, even if thereby he meets with contempt and detraction, than to be in real want, and all the time assuming the airs of a rich and prosperous man." This latter explanation seems most suitable, as it is not at all clear that, at the time the book was written, the Israelites of moderate fortune kept slaves, and the proverb would lose its force if they did not do so. Says a mediaeval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nobilitas morum plus ornat quam genitorum."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1 Those who have grace, will delight in the instructions given them. Those that stifle their convictions, are like brutes. 2. The man who covers selfish and vicious designs under a profession of religion or friendship, will be condemned. 3. Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts, they cannot settle and secure themselves. But those who by faith are rooted in Christ, are firmly fixed. 4. A wife who is pious, prudent, and looks well to the ways of her household, who makes conscience of her duty, and can bear crosses; such a one is an honour and comfort to her husband. She that is the reverse of this, preys upon him, and consumes him. 5. Thoughts are not free; they are under the Divine knowledge, therefore under the Divine command. It is a man's shame to act with deceit, with trick and design. 6. Wicked people speak mischief to their neighbours. A man may sometimes do a good work with one good word. 7. God's blessing is often continued to the families of godly men, while the wicked are overthrown. 8. The apostles showed wisdom by glorying in shame for the name of Christ. 9. He that lives in a humble state, who has no one to wait upon him, but gets bread by his own labour, is happier than he that glories in high birth or gay attire, and wants necessaries.</body></html>
