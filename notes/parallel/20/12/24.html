For "diligent" the Vulgate has <span class="accented">fortium</span>, "the strong and active;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "choice." Such men are sure to rise to the surface, and get the upper hand in a community, as the LXX. adds, "with facility," by a natural law. <span class="cmt_word">But the slothful</span> (literally, <span class="accented">slothfulness</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall be under tribute;</span> or, <span class="accented">reduced to compulsory service</span>, like the Gibeonites in Joshua's time, and the Canaanites under Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>). So <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>, "The fool shall be slave to the wise;" and an Israelite reduced to poverty might be made a servant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39, 40</a>). The LXX., taking the word in another sense, translates, "The crafty shall be for plunder;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they who think to succeed by fraud and trickery shall become the prey of those who are stronger than themselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:16. A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.</body></html>
