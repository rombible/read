The term is applied to Ruth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>). The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">diligens</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The expression means one of power either in mind or body, or both. The same idea is contained in <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="accented">virtus.</span> Such a woman is not simply loving and modest and loyal, but is <span class="cmt_word">a crown to her husband;</span> is an honour to him, adorns and beautifies his life, making, as it were, a joyous festival. So St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>) calls his converts "a crown of glorying." The allusion is to the crown worn by the bridegroom at his marriage, or to the garlands worn at feasts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-11.htm">Song of Solomon 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; Wisd. 2:8). The Son of Sirach has much praise for the virtuous woman: "Blessed is the man that hath a good (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) wife, for the number of his days shall be double. A virtuous (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace" (Ecclus. 26:1, 2). <span class="cmt_word">She that maketh ashamed;</span> "that doeth shamefully" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>); one who is a terrible contrast to the woman of strong character - weak, indolent, immodest, wasteful. <span class="cmt_word">Is as rottenness in his bones</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>). Such a wife poisons her husband's life, deprives him of strength and vigour; though she is made "bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>), far from being a helpmate for him, she saps his very existence. Septuagint, "As a worm in a tree, so an evil woman destroyeth a man." Here again Siracides has much to say, "A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees" (Ecclus. 25:23). Thus runs a Spanish maxim (Kelly, 'Proverbs of All Nations') - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Him that has a good wife no evil in life<br />that may not be borne can befall;<br />Him that has a bad wife no good thing in life<br />that chance to, that good you may call."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1 Those who have grace, will delight in the instructions given them. Those that stifle their convictions, are like brutes. 2. The man who covers selfish and vicious designs under a profession of religion or friendship, will be condemned. 3. Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts, they cannot settle and secure themselves. But those who by faith are rooted in Christ, are firmly fixed. 4. A wife who is pious, prudent, and looks well to the ways of her household, who makes conscience of her duty, and can bear crosses; such a one is an honour and comfort to her husband. She that is the reverse of this, preys upon him, and consumes him. 5. Thoughts are not free; they are under the Divine knowledge, therefore under the Divine command. It is a man's shame to act with deceit, with trick and design. 6. Wicked people speak mischief to their neighbours. A man may sometimes do a good work with one good word. 7. God's blessing is often continued to the families of godly men, while the wicked are overthrown. 8. The apostles showed wisdom by glorying in shame for the name of Christ. 9. He that lives in a humble state, who has no one to wait upon him, but gets bread by his own labour, is happier than he that glories in high birth or gay attire, and wants necessaries.</body></html>
