The "just man," on the contrary, avoids all this "trouble."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the transgression of the lips is an evil snare</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>). A man by speaking unadvisedly or intemperately brings trouble upon himself, involves himself in difficulties which he did not foresee. Often when he has spoken in order to injure others, the slander or the censure has redounded on himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>). The just; the man who does not offend with his lips, avoids these snares. The Septuagint here introduces a couplet not found in the Hebrew: "He who looketh gently (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) shall obtain mercy; but he who frequents the gates [or, 'contends in the gates,' <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>] will harass souls." This seems to mean the man who is calm and considerate for others will himself be treated with pity and consideration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>); but he who is a gossip, or a busybody, or litigious, will be always vexing his neighbours. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:10. A godly man would not put even an animal to needless pain. But the wicked often speak of others as well used, when they would not endure like treatment for a single day. 11. It is men's wisdom to mind their business, and follow an honest calling. But it is folly to neglect business; and the grace of God teaches men to disdain nothing but sin. 12. When the ungodly see others prosper by sin, they wish they could act in the same way. But the root of Divine grace, in the heart of the righteous, produces other desires and purposes. 13. Many a man has paid dear in this world for the transgression of his lips.</body></html>
