The LXX. translates "pitieth." The care for the lower animals, and their kind treatment, are not the produce of modern sentiment and civilization. Mosaic legislation and various expressions in Scripture recognize the duty. God's mercies are over all his works; he saves both man and beast; he hateth nothing that he hath made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; Wisd. 11:24). So he enacted that the rest of the sabbath should extend to the domestic animals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>); that a man should help the over-burdened beast, even of his enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4, 5</a>); that the unequal strength of the ox and the ass should not be yoked together in the plough (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>); that the ox should not be muzzled when he was treading out the corn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>): that the sitting bird should not be taken from her little brood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>), nor a kid seethed in its mother's milk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). Such humane injunctions were perhaps specially needed at a time when man's life was little regarded, and animal sacrifices had a tendency to make men cruel and unfeeling, when their symbolical meaning was obscured by long familiarity. These enactments regarding animals, and the mysterious significance affixed to the blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), afforded speaking lessons of tenderness and consideration for the inferior creatures, and <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> taught regard for the happiness and comfort of fellow men. Our blessed Lord has spoken of God's ears of flowers and the lower creatures of his hand. <span class="cmt_word">But the tender mercies;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the bowels</span>, regarded as the seat of feeling. The wicked cannot be supposed to have "tender mercies;" hence it is best to take the word in the sense of "feelings," "affections." What should be mercy and love are in an evil man only hard-heartedness and cruelty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:10. A godly man would not put even an animal to needless pain. But the wicked often speak of others as well used, when they would not endure like treatment for a single day. 11. It is men's wisdom to mind their business, and follow an honest calling. But it is folly to neglect business; and the grace of God teaches men to disdain nothing but sin. 12. When the ungodly see others prosper by sin, they wish they could act in the same way. But the root of Divine grace, in the heart of the righteous, produces other desires and purposes. 13. Many a man has paid dear in this world for the transgression of his lips.</body></html>
