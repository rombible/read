St. Jerome, <span class="accented">Labiis suis intelligitur inimicus</span>. But the verb here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5db;&#x5e8;</span>, bears the meaning "to make one's self unknown," as well as "to make one's self known," and hence "to make one's self unrecognizable" by dress or change of countenance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-5.htm">1 Kings 14:5</a>). This is much more appropriate in the present connection than the other explanation. The man cloaks his hatred with honeyed words. <span class="cmt_word">And layeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">up deceit within him;</span> meditating all the time treachery in his heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a>). Septuagint, "An enemy weeping promises all things with his lips, but in his heart he contriveth deceits." The tears in this case are hypocritical signs of sorrow, intended to deceive the dupe. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:24-26. Always distrust when a man speaks fair unless you know him well. Satan, in his temptations, speaks fair, as he did to Eve; but it is madness to give credit to him. 27. What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit, it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief to themselves. 28. There are two sorts of lies equally detestable. A slandering lie, the mischief of this every body sees. A flattering lie, which secretly works ruin. A wise man will be more afraid of a flatterer than of a slanderer.</body></html>
