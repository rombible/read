The pit is such a one as was made to catch wild animals; the maker is supposed to approach incautiously one of these traps, and to tall into it. <span class="cmt_word">And he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.</span> This does not refer to throwing stones into the air, which fall upon the head of the thrower, but to rolling stones up a height in order to hurl them down upon the enemy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>). Of such retributive justice we have numerous examples;<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Haman hung on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-9.htm">Esther 7:9</a>, etc.). So the old story tells how Perillus, the inventor of the brazen bull in which prisoners were to be burned alive, was himself made to prove the efficacy of his own invention by the tyrant Phalaris; as Ovid says <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Et Phalaris tauro violenti membra Perilli<br />Torruit; infelix imbuit auctor opus."</span><br />(<span class="note_acc">Art.

St. Chrysostom speaks of the blindness of malice: "Let us not plot against others, lest we injure ourselves. When we supplant the reputation of others, let us consider that we injure ourselves, it is against ourselves that we plot. For perchance with men we do him harm, if we have power, but ourselves in the sight of God, by provoking him against us. Let us not, then, injure ourselves. For as we injure ourselves when we injure our neighbours, so by benefiting them we benefit ourselves" ('Hom. 14, in Phil.,' Oxford transl.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:24-26. Always distrust when a man speaks fair unless you know him well. Satan, in his temptations, speaks fair, as he did to Eve; but it is madness to give credit to him. 27. What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit, it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief to themselves. 28. There are two sorts of lies equally detestable. A slandering lie, the mischief of this every body sees. A flattering lie, which secretly works ruin. A wise man will be more afraid of a flatterer than of a slanderer.</body></html>
