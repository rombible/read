There is a consensus of the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, and Targum to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> "truth," thinking apparently of the Aramaean <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> "that which is pure." But the hemistich would thus state the baldest truism, and modern commentators unite in assigning to the word some such sense as that given above in the Authorized Version. A liar shows his want of charity by slandering his neighbour; and that men dislike those whom they have injured is a common experience. "It is a characteristic of human nature," says Tacitus ('Agric.,' 42), "to hate those whom one has injured." Seneca, 'De Ira,' 2:83, "Hoe habent pessimum animi magna fortuna insolentes, quos laeserunt, et oderunt." <span class="cmt_word">A flattering mouth worketh ruin</span>; brings destruction on those who succumb to its seductive words. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Os lubricum operatur ruinas</span>; Septuagint, "A mouth uncovered (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) causeth tumults." (For "the smooth mouth," comp. ch. 5:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>.) The word for "tumults" is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which does not occur elsewhere in the Septuagint, but is common in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:24-26. Always distrust when a man speaks fair unless you know him well. Satan, in his temptations, speaks fair, as he did to Eve; but it is madness to give credit to him. 27. What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit, it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief to themselves. 28. There are two sorts of lies equally detestable. A slandering lie, the mischief of this every body sees. A flattering lie, which secretly works ruin. A wise man will be more afraid of a flatterer than of a slanderer.</body></html>
