The Hebrew reads in the margin "to him," instead of "not," in the sense that a causeless curse, though it passes out of sight like a bird in its flight, yet returns "to him" who uttered it--an idea expressed in more than one English proverb. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/109-17.htm" title="As he loved cursing, so let it come to him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.">Psalm 109:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm" title="So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.">Isaiah 55:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying.</span> "Bird" (<span class="accented">tsippor</span>) is the sparrow, which is found throughout Palestine; "swallow" (<span class="accented">deror</span>), the free flier. The Authorized Version hardly gives the sense. The line should be rendered, <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">the sparrow in</span> (in respect of) <span class="accented">its wandering</span>, <span class="accented">as the swallow in its flying</span>. The point of comparison is the vagueness and aimlessness of the birds' flight, or the uselessness of trying to catch them in their course. <span class="cmt_word">So the curse causeless shall not come.</span> It shall, as it were, spend its force in the air, and fall not on the head on which it was invoked. A causeless curse is that which is uttered against one who has done nothing to deserve such denunciation. Septuagint, "As birds and sparrows fly, so a causeless (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) curse shall come upon no one" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-2.htm">Nehemiah 13:2</a>.) Bailey, 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Blessings star forth forever; but a curse<br />Is like a cloud - it passes."</span> Closely connected with the superstition that dreads a curse is that which is alarmed by omens. Against this irrational fear we find some Eastern proverbs directed; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "The jackal howls: will my old buffalo die?" "The dog barks - still the caravan passes: will the barking of the dog reach the skies?" (Lane). Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, "not," the Keri reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, "to him." This makes the proverb say that the unprovoked curse shall return upon him who uttered it. But this reading is not to be accepted, as it does not suit the terms of comparison, though it seems to have been used by St. Jerome, who translates, <span class="accented">Sic maledictum frustra prolatum in quempiam superveniet</span>. This retributive justice is often alluded to elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ver. 27 (where see note). So we find in various languages proverbs to the same effect. Thus in English, "Harm watch, harm catch;" Spanish, "Who sows thorns, let him not walk barefoot;" Turkish, "Curses, like chickens, always come home to roost;" Yoruba, "Ashes always fly back in the face of him that throws them" (Trench). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:2. He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.</body></html>
