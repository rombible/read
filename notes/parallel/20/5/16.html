So Aben Ezra and the majority of modern commentators, Schultens, Doderlein, Holden, Muenscher, Noyes, Wardlaw, etc. The meaning appears to be, "Let thy marriage be blessed with many children, who may go forth abroad for the public good." Other interpretations have been adopted. Thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Delitzsch takes the words fountans and "rivers of waters" as used figuratively for the procreative power, and renders, "Shall thy streams flow abroad, and water brooks in the streets?" and interprets, "Let generative power act freely and unrestrainedly within the marriage relation." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Schultens and Dathe, followed by Holden, regard the verse as expressing a conclusion on the preceding, "Then shall thy springs be dispersed abroad, even rivers of waters in the streets." The objection to this is that it necessitates the insertion of the copulative <span class="accented">vau</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>) before the verb, <span class="accented">yaphutzu</span>, "be dispersed." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Zockler and Hitzig read the verse interrogatively, "Shall thy streams flow abroad as water brooks in the streets?" on the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The reading of the LXX., adopted by Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus, places a negative before the verb, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Let not thy waters flow beyond thy fountain;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "confine thyself to thy wife." <span class="accented">Fountains.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">ma'yanim</span>, plural of <span class="accented">mayan</span>, derived from <span class="accented">ayin</span> ("a fountain") with the formative <span class="accented">men</span>, is rather a stream or rill - water flowing on the surface of the ground. It is used, however, of a fountain itself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-2.htm">Genesis 8:2</a>. <span class="accented">Rivers of waters</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">pal'gey-mayim</span>); rather, <span class="accented">water courses</span>, or <span class="accented">water brooks</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25</a>). The <span class="accented">peleg</span> represents the various streams into which the <span class="accented">mayan</span>, "fountain," divides itself at its source or in its course. We find the same expression, <span class="accented">pal'gey-mayim</span>, used of tears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-136.htm">Psalm 119:136</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-48.htm">Lamentations 3:48</a>. It occurs again in our book in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of waters (<span class="accented">pal'gey mayim</span>)." On "abroad" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">khutz</span>), and "in the streets" (<span class="accented">r'khovoth</span>), see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-23 Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from these destructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are so foolish as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God to themselves, to go on in the way to destruction.</body></html>
