The consciousness of this fact is to be the restraining motive, inasmuch as he who sees will also punish every transgression. The great truth acknowledged here is the omniscience of God, a truth which is borne witness to in almost identical language in Job: "For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>; cf. 24:23 and Job 31:4). So Hanani the seer says to Asa King of Judah, "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>); and Jehovah says, in Jeremiah, "For mine eyes are upon all their ways, they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-17.htm">Jeremiah 16:17</a>; cf. 32:29); and again, in Hosea, "They are before my face" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-2.htm">Hosea 7:2</a>), and the same truth is re-echoed in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in all probability gathered from our passage, "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>)<span class="accented">. The ways of man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the conduct of any individual man or woman; <span class="accented">ish</span>, "man," being used generically. <span class="accented">Are before the eyes of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are an object on which Jehovah fixes his gaze and scrutiny. And he pondereth all his goings. The word "he pondereth" is in the original <span class="accented">m'phalles</span>, the piel participle <span class="accented">of philles</span>, piel of the unused kal, <span class="accented">palas</span>, and appears to be properly rendered in the Authorized Version. This verb, however, has various meanings: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to make level, or prepare, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a> and Proverbs 5:6; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to weigh, or consider accurately, in which sense it is used here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So Gesenius, Lee, Buxtorf, and Davidson. Jehovah not only sees, but weighs all that a man does, wheresoever he be, and will apportion rewards and punishments according to a man's actions (Patrick). The German commentators, Delitzsch and Zockler, however, look upon the word as indicating the overruling providence of God, just as the former part of the verse refers to his omniscience, and render, "he marketh out," in the sense that the Lord makes it possible for a man to walk in the way of uprightness and purity. There is nothing inherently objectionable in this view, since experience shows that the world is regulated by the Divine government, but it loses sight to some extent of the truth upon which the teacher appears to be insisting, which is that evil actions are visited with Divine retribution. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-23 Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from these destructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are so foolish as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God to themselves, to go on in the way to destruction.</body></html>
