It may also be rendered, "Far from smoothing for herself the path of life, her steps wander without her observing it." By these words is described the reckless career of a vicious woman, who at last dares not think whither her steps are leading her, but as it were with eyes shut, totters on till she falls to rise no more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them.</span> This verse should be rather rendered, <span class="accented">she walks not in the path of life, her ways fiuctuate, she knows not.</span> It consists of a series of independent proposiyions or statements, all of which are descriptive of the singularly fatuous conduct of "the strange woman." In the previous verse the teacher has said that her conduct leads to ruin; he here further emphasizes the idea by putting forward the same truth from the opposite, or, as we may say, from the negative point of view, and so completes the picture. "The words," as Plumptre remarks, "describe with terrible vividness the state of heart and soul which prostitution brings on its victims." Her course is one o(persistent, wilful, headstrong, blind folly and wickedness. <span class="accented">Lest</span>; <span class="accented">pen</span>; here "not," equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">lo</span>). So the LXX., Vulgate, Targum, Syriac. The use of <span class="accented">pen</span>, in this sense is, however, unique (Gesenius). Delitzsch and Zockler, following Luther, Geier, Holden, etc., assign to it an emphatic negative force, as, "She is <span class="accented">far removed from</span> entering," or, "she <span class="accented">never</span> treadeth." Others take <span class="accented">pen</span> as a dependent prohibitive particle, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">forte</span>, "lest," as in the Authorized Version, and employed to connect the sentence which it introduces either with the preceding verse (as Schultens) or with the second hemistich, on which it is made dependent (Holden, Wordsworth, Aben Ezra, <span class="accented">loc</span>., Michaelis, etc.). <span class="accented">Thou shouldest ponder</span>; <span class="accented">t'phalles</span>, connected by makkeph with <span class="accented">pen</span>, as usual (Lee), is either second person masculine or third person feminine. The latter is required here, the subject of the sentence being "the strange woman," as appears clearly from the second hemistich, "<span class="accented">her</span> ways," etc. The verb <span class="accented">patas</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-26.htm">Proverbs 14:26</a>) here means "to prepare," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to walk in, or to travel over. Thus Gesenius renders, "She (the adulteress) prepareth not (for herself) the way of life:" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she does not walk in the way of life; cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Vulgate <span class="accented">ambulant</span> (sc. <span class="accented">gressus ejus</span>), and other ancient versions, all of which understand the verb in this sense. The meaning of the phrase, <span class="accented">pen t'phalles</span>, is, therefore, "she walks not" in the way of life - the way that has life for its object, and which in itself is full of life and safety. Far from doing this, the teacher goes on to say, <span class="accented">her ways are movable</span>; literally, <span class="accented">go to and fro</span>, or <span class="accented">fluctuate</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they wilfully stagger hither and thither, like the steps of a drunkard, or like the uncertain steps of the blind, for the verb <span class="accented">nua</span> is so used in the former sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-20.htm">Isaiah 24:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a>; and in the latter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>. Her steps are slippery (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), or wander (Vulgate, <span class="accented">vagi</span>); they are without any definite aim; she is always straying in the vagrancy of sin (Wordsworth); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>. <span class="accented">That thou canst not know them</span> (<span class="accented">lo theda</span>); literally, <span class="accented">she knows not</span>. The elliptical form of this sentence in the original leaves it open to various interpretations. It seems to refer to the way of life; she knows not the way of life, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she does not regard or perceive the way of life. The verb <span class="accented">yada</span> often has this meaning. The meaning may be obtained by supplying <span class="accented">mah</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">quicquam</span>, "anything," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-13.htm">Proverbs 9:13</a>, "She knows not anything," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she knows nothing. The objection to this is that it travels unnecessarily out of the sentence to find the object which ought rather to be supplied from the context. The object may possibly be the staggering of her feet: she staggers hither and thither without her perceiving it (Delitzsch); or it may, lastly, be indefinite: she knows not whittler her steps conduct her (Wordsworth and Zockler). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-14 Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!</body></html>
