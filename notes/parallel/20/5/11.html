It is not the plaintive wailing or the subdued grief of heart which is signified, but the loud wail of lamentation, the groaning indicative of intense mental suffering called forth by the remembrance of past folly, and which sees no remedy in the future. The verb <span class="accented">naham</span> occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>, where it is used of the roaring of the lion, and the cognate noun <span class="accented">naham</span> is met with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a> and Proverbs 20:2 in the same sense. By Ezekiel it is used of the groaning of the people of Jerusalem when they shall see their sanctuary profaned, their sons and their daughters fall by the sword, and their city destroyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>). Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29, 30</a>) applies it to the <span class="accented">roaring</span> of the sea. The Vulgate reproduces the idea in <span class="accented">gemas</span>, equivalent to "and thou groan." The LXX. rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, "and thou shelf repent," arising from the adoption of a different pointing, <span class="accented">nikhamta</span>, from the niph. <span class="accented">nikham</span>, "to repent," for <span class="accented">nahamta</span>, to some extent expresses the sense. <span class="accented">At the last</span>; literally, <span class="accented">at thine end</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when thou art ruined, or, as the teacher explains, <span class="accented">when thy flesh and thy body are consumed.</span> The expression, "thy flesh and thy body," here stands for the whole body, the body in its totality, not the body and the soul, which would be different. Of these two words "the flesh" (<span class="accented">basar</span>) rather denotes the flesh in its strict sense as such (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a>), while "body" (<span class="accented">sh'er</span>) is the flesh adhering to the bones. Gesenlus regards them as synonymous terms, stating, however, that <span class="accented">sh'er</span> is the more poetical as to use. The word <span class="accented">basar</span> is used to denote the whole body in ch. 14:30. It is clear that, by the use of these two terms here, the teacher is following a peculiarity observable elsewhere in the Proverbs, of combining two terms to express, and so to give force to, one idea. The expression describes "the utter destruction of the libertine" (Umbreit). This destruction, as further involving the ruin of the soul, is described in ch. 6:32, "Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul (<span class="accented">nephesh</span>)" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22, 23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-14 Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!</body></html>
