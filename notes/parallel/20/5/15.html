The same figure is employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-15.htm" title="A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>, where a wife is compared to "a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm" title="For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.">Jeremiah 2:13</a> God compares Himself to a "fountain of living waters," and complains that Israel had deserted Him, and hewed out for themselves "broken cisterns that can hold no water." This passage in Proverbs has in like manner often been interpreted as an exhortation to drink deeply from the living waters of the Holy Spirit given in the Word and Sacraments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>).--For ref. see Bishop Wordsworth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-19.</span> - <span class="accented">Commendation of the chaste intercourse of marriage.</span> In this section the teacher passes from admonitory warnings against unchastity to the commendation of conjugal fidelity and pure love. The allegorical exposition of this passage, current at the period of the Revision of the Authorized Version in 1612, as referring to liberality, is not <span class="accented">ad rem</span>. Such an idea had no place certainly in the teacher's mind, nor is it appropriate to the context, the scope of which is, as we have seen, to warn youth against indulgence in illicit pleasures, by pointing out the terrible consequences which follow, and to indicate, on the other hand, in what direction the satisfaction of natural wants is to be obtained, that so, the heart and conscience being kept pure, sin and evil may be avoided. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Drink waters out of thine own cistern,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the wife of your own choice, or in the legitimate sphere of marriage, seek the satisfaction of your natural impulses. The pure, innocent, and chaste nature of such pleasures is appropriately compared with the pure and wholesome waters of the cistern and the wellspring. The "drinking" carries with it the satisfying of a natural want. Agreeably with oriental and scriptural usage, "the wife" is compared with a "cistern" and "well." Thus in the Song of Solomon the "bride" is called a spring shut up, a fountain sealed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>). Sarah is spoken of under exactly the same figure that is used here, viz. the <span class="accented">bor</span>, or "cistern," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>. The figure was not confined to women, however, as we find Judah alluded to as "waters" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>, and Jacob or Israel so appearing in the prophecy of Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-7.htm">Numbers 24:7</a>). The people are spoken of by David as they that are "of the fountain of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>). A similar imagery is employed in the New Testament of the wife. The apostles St. Paul and St. Peter both speak of her as "the vessel (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). The forms of the original, <span class="accented">b'or</span> and <span class="accented">b'er</span>, standing respectively for "cistern" and "well," indicate a common derivation from <span class="accented">baar</span>, "to dig." But <span class="accented">bor</span> is an artificially constructed reservoir or cistern, equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">cisterna</span>, and LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, while <span class="accented">b'er</span> is the natural spring of water, equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">putens.</span> So Aben Ezra, who says, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2</a>:36, "<span class="accented">Bor</span> is that which catches the rain, while <span class="accented">b'er</span> is that from within which the water wells up." This explanation, however, does not entirely cover the terms as used here. The "waters" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">mayim</span>) may be the pure water conveyed into the cistern, and not simply the water which is caught in its descent born heaven. The parallel term, "running waters" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">noz'lim</span>), describes the flowing limpid stream fit, like the other, for drinking purposes. A similar use of the terms is made in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-15.htm">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>, "a well of living waters (<span class="accented">b'er mayim khayyim</span>) and streams (<span class="accented">v'noz'lim</span>) from Lebanon." It may be remarked that the allusion to the wife, under the figures employed, enhances her value. It indicates the high estimation in which she is to be held, since the "cistern" or "well" was one of the most valuable possessions and adjuncts of an Eastern house. The teaching of the passage, in its bearing on the subject of marriage, coincides with that which is subsequently put forward by St. Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-23 Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from these destructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are so foolish as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God to themselves, to go on in the way to destruction.</body></html>
