It is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8</a>. The Vulgate renders "honour," and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, "life." <span class="accented">Hod</span> is derived from the Arabic word signifying "to lift one's self up," and then "to be eminent, beautiful." <span class="accented">Thy years</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the best and most vigorous, and hence the most useful and valuable, years of life. <span class="accented">Unto the cruel</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">l'ak'zari</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to the cruel one</span>; but the adjective <span class="accented">akzari</span> is only found in the singular, and may be here used in a collective sense as designating the <span class="accented">entourage of</span> the harlot, her associates who prey pitilessly on the youth whom they bring within the range of her fascinations. So Delitzsch. It seems to be so understood by the LXX., which reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">immitentibus</span>; but not so by the Vulgate, which adheres to the singular, <span class="accented">crudeli.</span> If we adhere to the gender of the adjective <span class="accented">akzari</span>, which is masculine, and to its number, it may designate the husband of the adulteress, who will deal mercilessly towards the paramour of his wife. So Zockler. Again, it may refer, notwithstanding the gender, to the harlot herself (so Vatablus and Holden). who is cruel, who has no love for the youth, and would see him perish without pity. The explanation of Stuart and others, including Ewald, that the "cruel one" is the purchaser of the punished adulterer, is without foundation or warrant, since there is no historical instance on record where the adulterer was reduced to slavery, and the punishment inflicted by the Mosaic code was not slavery, but death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>), and, as it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm">Ezekiel 16:40</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm">John 8:5</a>, death from stoning. The adjective <span class="accented">akzari</span>, like its equivalent <span class="accented">akzar</span>, is derived from the verb <span class="accented">kazar</span>, "to break," and occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-11.htm">Proverbs 17:11</a>. The moral of the warning is a wasted life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-14 Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!</body></html>
