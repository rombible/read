From the universal statement of God's omniscience and the Divine judgment, the teacher passes to the fate of the profligate. His end is inevitable ruin and misery. The deep moral lesson conveyed is that sin carries with it its own Nemesis. Adultery and impurity, like all sin of which they are forms, are retributive. The career of the adulterer is a career begun, continued, and ended in folly (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his manifold sins shall overtake and arrest him. The imagery is borrowed from the snare of the fowler. The emphatic form of the original, "His sins shall overtake him, the impious man," point conclusively to the adulterer. It is "his" sins that shall overtake him, not those of another, and they shall fall upon his own head; and further, his character is depicted in the condemning clause, "the impious man;" for such he is. <span class="accented">Shall take.</span> The verb <span class="accented">lakad</span> is literally "to take or catch animals in a snare or net," properly "to strike with a net." The wicked man becomes entangled and caught in his own sins; he is struck down and captured by them, just as the prey is struck by the snare of the fowler. The verb is, of course, used metaphorically, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>. <span class="accented">The wicked</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">eth-harasa</span>); in the original introduced as explanatory of the object, "him." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</span> The Authorized Version follows the LXX. and Vulgate in rendering "his sins," instead of the original "his sin" (<span class="accented">khattatho</span>). It is not so much every sin of man which shall hold him, though this is true, as the particular sin treated of in the address, viz. adultery, which shall do this. The expression, "the cords of his sin" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">khavley khattatho</span>), means the cords which his sin weaves around him. Nothing else will be requisite to bind and hold him fast for punishment (cf. "cords of vanity," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-23 Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from these destructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are so foolish as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God to themselves, to go on in the way to destruction.</body></html>
