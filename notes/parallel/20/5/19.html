(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-9.htm" title="My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he stands behind our wall, he looks forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice.">Song of Solomon 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-17.htm" title="Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be you like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.">Song of Solomon 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-3.htm" title="Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.">Song of Solomon 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-14.htm" title="Make haste, my beloved, and be you like to a roe or to a young hart on the mountains of spices.">Song of Solomon 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-33.htm" title="He makes my feet like hinds' feet, and sets me on my high places.">Psalm 18:33</a>.) Both these animals are said to be remarkable for their affection to their young.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe.</span> The words in italics do not occur in the original. The expression, "the loving hind and pleasant roe," is, therefore, to be attached to the preceding verse, as carrying on the sense and as descriptive of the grace and fascinating charms of the young wife. As combining these attributes, she is to be the object of thy love and devotion,the one in whom thine affections are to find the fulfilment of their desires. Love and grace are her possessions. The <span class="accented">loving hind</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ayyeleth ahavim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the hind of loves</span>, which may be understood, as in the Authorized Version, as pointing to the fondness of this animal for its young, or as descriptive of its beauty and the extreme gracefulness of its form. In this sense the phrase may be rendered, "the lovely hind." The <span class="accented">ayyeleth</span>, or <span class="accented">ayyalah</span>, feminine of <span class="accented">ayyal</span>, "stag," or "hart," was in all probability the gazelle, <span class="accented">Pleasant roe</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">yhaalath khen</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the ibex of grace.</span> The particular expression only occurs here in the Bible. <span class="accented">The yaalath is the</span> feminine of <span class="accented">yaal</span>, "the ibex" or "mountain goat" according to Bochart, or the "chamois" according to Gesenius. It does not appear that it is so much "the pleasantness" or amiability of this animal which is here alluded to as its gracefulness of form. As terms of endearment, the words entered largely into the erotic poetry of the East. Thus in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-5.htm">Song of Solomon 4:5</a> the bride likens her beloved to "a roe or young hart" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4.htm">Song of Solomon 4</a>:17 and Song 8:14). while numerous examples might be quoted from the Arabian and Persian poets. They were also employed sometimes as names for women. Compare the superscription of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, <span class="accented">Ayyeleth hash-shakar</span>, "Upon the hind of the dawn." <span class="cmt_word">Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times.</span> The love of the wife is to refresh and fully satisfy the husband. The word <span class="accented">dadeyah</span>, "her breasts," only occurs here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3, 8, 21</a>, and is equivalent to <span class="accented">dodeyah</span>, "her love." The marginal reading, "water thee," serves to bring out the literal meaning of the <span class="accented">y'ravvuka</span>, derived from <span class="accented">ravah</span>, in kal, "to drink largely," "to be satisfied with drink," but misses the emphatic force of the piel, "to be fully satisfied or satiated." This is expressed very forcibly in the Vulgate rendering, "Let her breasts inebriate thee (<span class="accented">indebrient te</span>)," which represents the strong influence which the attractions of the wife are to maintain. The LXX., on the other hand, avoiding the rather sensual colouring of the language, substitutes, "May she thine own lead thee, and be with thee always." <span class="cmt_word">And be thou ravished always with her love</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let it intoxicate thee. The teacher, by a bold figure, describes the entire fascination which the husband is to allow the wife to exercise over him. The verb <span class="accented">shagah</span> is "to reel under the influence of wine," and is so used in the succeeding vers. 20 and 23, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>. The primary meaning, "to err from the way," scarcely applies here, and does not express the idea of the teacher, which is to describe "an intensity of love connected with the feeling of superabundant happiness" (Delitzsch). The Vulgate, <span class="accented">In amore ejus delectare jugiter</span>, "In her love delight thyself continually," and the LXX., "For in her love thou shalt be daily engaged," are mere paraphrases. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-23 Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from these destructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are so foolish as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God to themselves, to go on in the way to destruction.</body></html>
