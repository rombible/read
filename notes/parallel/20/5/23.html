The obvious meaning is, because he gave no heed to instruction. So Aben Ezra and Gersom. The Authorized Version is at least ambiguous, and seems to imply that the adulterer has been without instruction, without any to reprove or counsel him. But such is not the case. He has been admonished of the evil consequences of his sin, but to these warnings he has turned a deaf ear, and the teacher says therefore he shall die. The Vulgate supports this explanation, <span class="accented">quia non habuit disciplinam</span> "because he did not entertain or use instruction." In the LXX. the idea is enlarged, "He shall die together with these who have no instruction (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." The <span class="accented">b</span>' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>) in <span class="accented">b'eyn</span> is causal, and equivalent to <span class="accented">propter</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-28.htm">Genesis 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>. A similar statement is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a>, "They die even without wisdom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because they have disregarded the lessons of wisdom; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a>, "They shall die without knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray;</span> better, as Delitzsch, "He shall stagger to ruin." The verb <span class="accented">shagah</span> is used as in vers. 19 and 20, but with a deeper and more dread significance. A climax is reached in the manner in which the end of the adulterer is portrayed. His end is without a gleam of hope or satisfaction. With an understanding darkened and rendered callous by unrestrained indulgence in lust, and by folly which has reached its utmost limits and cannot, as it were, be surpassed, in that it has persistently and wilfully set aside and scorned wisdom and true happiness, the adulterer, like the drunkard, who is oblivious of the danger before him, shall stagger to ruin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-23 Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from these destructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are so foolish as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God to themselves, to go on in the way to destruction.</body></html>
