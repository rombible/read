The margin reads, "thy strength" for "thy wealth," but the text properly renders the original <span class="accented">koakh</span>, which means "substance," "wealth," "riches" - the youth's possessions in money and property (Delitzsch). The primary meaning of the word is "strength" or "might," as appears from the verb <span class="accented">kakhakh</span>, "to exert one's self," from which it is derived, but the parallel <span class="accented">atsabeyka</span>, "thy toils," rendered "thy labours," determines its use in the secondary sense here. Compare the similar passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-9.htm">Hosea 7:9</a>, "Strangers have devoured his strength [<span class="accented">koakh, i.e.</span> ' his possessions'], and he knoweth it not" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-22.htm">Job 6:22</a>). <span class="accented">Koakh</span> is the concrete product resulting from the abstract strength or ability when brought into action. <span class="accented">Thy labours</span> (<span class="accented">atsabeyka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy toils, the product of laborious toil, that which you have gotten by the labour of your hands, and earned with the sweat of your brow. Fleischer compares the Italian <span class="accented">i miri sudori</span>, and the French <span class="accented">mes sueurs.</span> The singular <span class="accented">etsev</span> signifies "heavy toilsome labour," and the plural (<span class="accented">atsavim</span>, "labours," things done with toil, and so the idea passes to the resultant of the labour. Compare the very similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>, <span class="accented">lekhem naatsavim</span>, equivalent to "bread obtained by toilsome labour;" Authorized Version, "the bread of sorrows." The Authorized Version properly supplies the verb "be" against those (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Holden <span class="accented">et alli</span>) who join on "thy labours" to the previous verb "be filled," as an accusative, and render, "and with thy labours in the house of a stranger." So also the LXX. and the Vulgate, "and thy labours come" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, LXX.) or "be" (<span class="accented">sint</span>, Vulgate) "to the house of strangers" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) or, "in a strange house" (<span class="accented">in aliena domo</span>). In the latter case the Vulgate is wrong, as <span class="accented">nok'ri</span> in the phrase <span class="accented">beyth nok'ri</span> is always personal (Delitzsch), and should be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "in the house of a stranger." The meaning of the verse is that a life of impurity transfers the profligate's substance, his wealth and possessions, to others, who will be satiated at his expense, and, being strangers, are indifferent to his ruin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-14 Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!</body></html>
