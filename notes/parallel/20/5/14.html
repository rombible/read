The fact which the ruined youth laments is the extent and audacity of his sins. It is not that he accuses himself of hypocrisy in religion (Delitzsch), but he adds another clement in his career of vice. He has disregarded the warnings and reproofs of his teachers and friends; but more, the presence of the congregation of God's people, a silent but not a less impressive protest, had no restraining effect upon him. The words, "the congregation and assembly" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">kahal v'edah</span>), seem to be used to heighten the conception, rather than to express two distinct and separate ideas, since we find them both used interchangeably to designate the congregation of the Israelites. The radical conception of <span class="accented">kahal</span> ("congregation") is the same as that of the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and Vulgate <span class="accented">ecclesia</span>, viz. the congregation looked upon from the point of its being called together, <span class="accented">kahal</span> being derived from <span class="accented">kahal</span>, which in hiph. is equivalent to "to call together," while that of <span class="accented">edah</span> is the congregation looked at from the point of its having assembled <span class="accented">edah</span> being derived from <span class="accented">yaad</span>, in niph. equivalent to "to come together." The latter will therefore stand for any assembly of people specially convened or coming together for some definite object, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> and the Vulgate <span class="accented">synagoga</span>. The term <span class="accented">edah</span> is, however, used in a technical sense as signifying the <span class="accented">seventy elders</span>, or senators, who judged the people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Rabbi Salomon so explains <span class="accented">haedah</span> as "the congregation," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>. Other explanations, however, have been given of these words. Zockler takes <span class="accented">kahal</span> as the convened council of elders acting as judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Deuteronomy 33:4, 5</a>), and <span class="accented">edah</span> as the concourse (<span class="accented">coetus</span>) of the people executing the condemning sentence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-15.htm">Numbers 15:15</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a>), and renders, "Well nigh had I fallen into utter destruction in the midst of the assembly and the congregation." Fleischer, Vatablus, and Bayne take much the same view, looking upon <span class="accented">ra</span> ("evil," Authorized Version) as "punishment," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the evil which follows as a consequence of sin - a usage supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-18.htm">2 Samuel 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-19.htm">Exodus 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-23.htm">1 Chronicles 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a> - rather than as evil <span class="accented">per se, i.e.</span> that which is morally bad, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22</a>. Aben Ezra considers that the <span class="accented">perfect</span> is used for the <span class="accented">future</span>; "In a little time I shall be involved in all evil;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> punishment, which is looked forward to prospectively. For "almost" (<span class="accented">ki</span>-<span class="accented">mat</span>, equivalent to "within a little," "almost," "nearly"), see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-87.htm">Psalm 119:87</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-14 Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!</body></html>
