So God's message to St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-10.htm" title="And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.">Revelation 10:10</a>) was in his mouth sweet as honey (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm" title="More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.">Psalm 19:10</a>), but made his belly bitter: that is, he met with much sorrow and trouble in making it known to men, but through this "much tribulation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm" title="Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.">Acts 14:22</a>) he "entered into the kingdom of heaven."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The contrast is drawn with great vividness between the professions of the "strange woman" and the disastrous consequences which overtake those who listen to her enticements. She promises enjoyment, pleasure, freedom from danger, but <span class="cmt_word">her end is bitter as wormwood.</span> "Her end," not merely with reference to herself, which may be and is undoubtedly true, but the last of her as experienced by those who have intercourse with her - her character as it stands revealed at the last. So it is said of wine, "At the last," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its final effects, if indulged in to excess, "it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22</a>). <span class="accented">Bitter as wormwood.</span> The Hebrew, <span class="accented">laanah</span>, "wormwood," Gesenius derives from the unused root <span class="accented">laan</span>, "to curse." It is the equivalent to the <span class="accented">absinthium</span> of the Vulgate. So Aquila, who has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The LXX. improperly renders <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, "gall." In other places the word <span class="accented">laanah</span> is used as the emblem of bitterness, with the superadded idea of its being poisonous, also according to the Hebrew notion, shared in also by the Greeks, that the plant combined these two qualities. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a> it is associated with <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "a poisonful herb" (margin), and the Targum terms it, agreeably with this notion, "deadly wormwood." The same belief is reproduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-11.htm">Revelation 8:11</a>, "And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>: 6:12). The apostle, no doubt, has it in mind when he speaks of any "root of bitterness," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>. The herb is thus described by Umbreit: "It is a plant toward two feet high, belonging to the genus <span class="accented">Artemisia</span> (species <span class="accented">Artemisia absinthium</span>), which produces a very firm stalk with many branches, grayish leaves, and small, almost round, pendent blossoms. It has a bitter and saline taste, and seems to have been regarded in the East as also a poison, of which the frequent combination with <span class="accented">rosh</span> gives an intimation." Terence has a strikingly similar passage to the one before us - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">In melle sunt linguae sitae vestrae atque orations<br />Lacteque; corda felle sunt lita atque acerbo aceto."</span> Your tongues are placed in honey and your speech is milk; your hearts are besmeared with gall and sharp vinegar ('Trucul.,' 1:11. 75). <span class="cmt_word">Sharp as a two-edged sword;</span> literally, <span class="accented">as a sword of edges</span> (<span class="accented">kherev piphiyyoth</span>), which may mean a sword of extreme sharpness. Her end is as sharp as the sharpest sword. But it seems better to take the term as it is understood in the Authorized Version, which has the support both of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">gladius biceps</span>, and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a two-edged sword." Compare "a two-edged sword" (<span class="accented">kherev piphiyyoth</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>. The meaning is, the last of her is poignancy of remorse, anguish of heart, and death. In these she involves her victims. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-14 Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!</body></html>
