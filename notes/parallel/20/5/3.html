The conjunction "for" (Hebrew <span class="accented">ki</span>) here, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, states the reason why the preceding exhortation is worthy of attention. Some commentators render "although," "albeit," as corresponding with the antithetical "but" in ver. 4. <span class="accented">The lips</span>; <span class="accented">siphthey</span>, the construct case of <span class="accented">saphah</span> in ver. 2. The organ of speech is here used for the speech itself, like the parallel "mouth." <span class="accented">A strange woman</span> (<span class="accented">zarah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the harlot. The word occurs before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, and again inch. 5:20; 7:5; 22:14; 23. 33. She is <span class="accented">extranea</span>, a stranger with respect to the youth whom she would beguile, either as being of foreign extraction, or as being the wife of another man, in which capacity she is so represented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-19.htm">Proverbs 7:19</a>. In this sense she would be an adulteress. St. Jerome, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6.htm">Ezekiel 6</a>, takes her as the representative of the allurements from sound doctrine, and of corrupt worship (Wordsworth). <span class="accented">Drop as an honeycomb</span> (<span class="accented">nopheth tithoph</span> <span class="accented">nah</span>); rather, <span class="accented">distil honey.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">nophteth</span> is properly a "dropping," <span class="accented">distillatio</span>, and so the honey flowing from the honeycombs (<span class="accented">tsuphim</span>). Kimchi explains it as the honey flowing from the cells before they are broken, and hence it is the <span class="accented">pure fine virgin honey.</span> Exactly the same phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>, "Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as an honeycomb (<span class="accented">nopheth tithoph'nah</span>)." The only other places where we meet with the word <span class="accented">nopheth</span> are <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-10.htm">Psalm 24:10</a> (11) (there combined with <span class="accented">tsuphim</span>, which helps to determine its meaning) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-7.htm">Proverbs 27:7</a>. The meaning is the same as she "flattereth with her words" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>, in which chapter the teacher gives an example of the alluring words which the strange woman uses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14-20</a>). As honey is sweet and attractive to the taste, so in a higher degree are her words pleasant to the senses. <span class="cmt_word">Her mouth is smoother than oil;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her words are most plausible and persuasive. The Hebrew <span class="accented">khik</span> is properly "the palate," though it also included the corresponding lower part of the mouth (Gesenius). It is used as the instrument or organ of speech in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-7.htm">Proverbs 8:7</a>, "For my mouth (<span class="accented">khik</span>) shall speak truth;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-30.htm">Job 31:30</a>, "I have not suffered my mouth (<span class="accented">khik</span>) to sin." Under the same figure David describes the treachery of his friend in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>, "His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-14 Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!</body></html>
