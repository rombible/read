The first is, <span class="cmt_word">that thou mayest regard discretion</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">lishmor m'zimmoth</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to guard reflection</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in other words, that thou mayest maintain thoughtfulness, observe counsel, set a proper guard or control over thy thoughts, and so restrain them within proper and legitimate limits, or form such resolutions which, being well considered and prudential, may result in prudent conduct. The word <span class="accented">m'zimmoth</span>, however, does not travel beyond the sphere of what is conceived in the mind, and consequently does not mean conduct (as Holden conceives), except in a secondary sense, as that thoughts and plans are the necessary preliminaries to action and conduct. Muffet, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, explains, "that thou mayest not conceive in mind any evil or vanity." The word <span class="accented">m'zimmoth</span> is the plural of <span class="accented">m'zimmmah</span>, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>. This word generally means any plan, project, device, either in a good or bad sense. In the latter sense it is applied to intrigue and deceitful conduct, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-8.htm">Proverbs 24:8</a>. It is here used in a good sense. Indeed, Delitzsch remarks that the use of the word in a good sense is peculiar to the introductory part of the Proverbs (ch. 1-9.). The Vulgate renders. "That thou mayest guard thy thoughts or reflection (<span class="accented">ut custodias cogitationes</span>)." So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "That thou mayest guard good reflection," the adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;</span> being introduced to note the sense in which the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> act of thinking, properly, is to be understood. The prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;</span> ("to") before <span class="accented">shamar</span>, "to guard," in <span class="accented">lishmor</span>, expresses the purpose, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>, <span class="accented">et alia.</span> The second end in view is, that <span class="cmt_word">thy lips may keep knowledge;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and thy lips shall keep knowledge.</span> Those lips keep or preserve knowledge which literally retain the instruction of Wisdom (Zockler), or which allow nothing to pass them which does not proceed from the knowledge of God (Delitzsch), and which, when they speak, give utterance to sound wisdom. The meaning may be illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, "I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress." The same expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>, "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> preserve and give utterance to it. Where "the lips keep knowledge," there they are protected against the lips of the strange woman, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> against her allurements, because they will be fortified with purity. <span class="accented">Thy lips</span>; <span class="accented">s'phatheyka</span> is the dual of the feminine noun <span class="accented">saphah</span>, "a lip." The teacher designedly uses this word instead of "thy heart" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1</a>), because of the contrast which he has in mind, and which be produces in the next verse. The LXX., Vulgate. and Arabic add, "Attend not to the deceitful woman," which Houbigant and Schleusner think is required by the context. The addition, however, is without authority (Holden). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-14 Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!</body></html>
