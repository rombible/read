The Vulgate <span class="accented">pauperis</span> gives a wrong impression. The persons intended are such as take a gloomy view of things, who are always in low spirits, and cannot rise superior to present circumstances. These never have a happy moment; they are always taking anxious thought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>), and forecasting evil. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>, translates, "At all times the eyes of the evil expect evil." <span class="cmt_word">But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.</span> The cheerful man's condition is a banquet unceasingly, a fixed state of joy and contentment. Septuagint, "But the righteous are at peace always;" Vulgate, "A secure mind is like a perpetual feast." "For," says St. Gregory ('Moral,' 12:44), "the mere repose of security is like the continuance of refreshment. Whereas, on the other hand, the evil mind is always set in pains and labours, since it is either contriving mischiefs that it may bring down, or fearing lest these be brought down upon it by others." Our own proverb says, "A contented mind is a continual feast." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:14. A wise man seeks to gain more wisdom, growing in grace and in the knowledge of Christ. But a carnal mind rests contented, flattering itself. 15. Some are much in affliction, and of a sorrowful spirit. Such are to be pitied, prayed for, and comforted. And others serve God with gladness of heart, and it prompts their obedience, yet they should rejoice with trembling.</body></html>
