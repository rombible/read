Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18-19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of life is above to the wise;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">to the wise the way of life goeth upward.</span> The writer means primarily that the wise and good lead such a life as to preserve them from death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>). The path may be steep and painful, but at any rate it has this compensation - it leads away from destruction. It is obvious to read into the passage higher teaching. The good man's path leads heavenward, to a high life here, to happiness hereafter; his conversation is in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>), his affections are set on things above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>). Such an upward life tends to material and spiritual health, as it is added, <span class="cmt_word">that he may depart from hell</span> (<span class="accented">SheoI</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>beneath</span>. Primarily, a long and happy life is promised to the man who fears the Lord, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16</a>; secondarily, such a one avoids that downward course which ends in the darkness of hell. Vulgate, "The path of life is above the instructed man, to make him avoid the nethermost (<span class="accented">novissimo</span>) hell;" Septuagint, "The thoughts of the prudent man are the ways of life, that turning from Hades he may be safe." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:16,17. Believers often have enough when worldly eyes see little; the Lord is with them, without the cares, troubles, and temptations which are with the wealth of the wicked. 18. He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate, they are not likely to bring any thing to pass. 23. Wisdom is needed to suit our discourse to the occasions. 24. A good man sets his affections on things above; his way leads directly thither.</body></html>
