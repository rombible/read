The frequently threatened punishment against one who removes his neighbour's landmark, shews the offence to have been a common form of oppression. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm" title="You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in your inheritance, which you shall inherit in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess it.">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm" title="Cursed be he that removes his neighbor's landmark.

The proud, self-confident man, with his family and household and wealth, shall be rooted up. The heathen saw how retribution overtook the arrogant. Thus Euripides says ('Heracl.,' 387) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Zeus, the chastiser of too haughty thoughts."</span> <span class="cmt_word">But he will establish the border of the widow</span>. He will take the widow under his protection, and see that her landmark is not removed, and that her little portion is secured to her. The widow is taken as the type of weakness and desolation, as often in Scripture (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>). In a country where property was defined by landmarks - stones or some such objects - nothing was easier than to remove these altogether, or to alter their position. That this was a common form of fraud and oppression we gather from the stringency of the enactments against the offence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a>). In the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions which have been preserved, there are many invoking curses, curious and multifarious, against the disturbers of boundaries. Such marks were considered sacred and inviolable by the Greeks and Romans (see Plato, 'De Leg.,' 8:842, 843; Ovid, 'Fast.,' 2:639, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:25. Pride is the ruin of multitudes. But those who are in affliction God will support. 26. The thoughts of wicked men offend Him who knows the heart. 27. The covetous man lets none of his family have rest or enjoyment. And greediness of gain often tempts to projects that bring ruin. 28. A good man is proved to be a wise man by this; he governs his tongue well.</body></html>
