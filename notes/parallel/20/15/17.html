Where love presides, the simplest food is cheerfully received, and contentment and happiness abound (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>). Lesetre quotes Horace's invitation to his friend Torquatus ('Epist.,' 1:5. 1) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Si potes Archiacis conviva recumbere lectis,<br />Nec modica cenare times olus omne patella,<br />Supreme te sole domi, Torquate, manebo."</span><br /><br /><span class="accented">"If, dear Torquatus, you can rest your head<br />On couches such as homely Archias made,<br />Nor on a dish of simple pot herbs frown,<br />I shall expect you as the sun goes down."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) So the old jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Cum dat oluscula menes minuscula pace quieta,<br />Ne pete grandia lautaque prandia lite repleta."</span> A stalled ox is one taken up out of the pasture and fatted for the table. Thus we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-23.htm">1 Kings 4:23</a>) that part of Solomon's provision for one day was ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures; and the prophets speak of "calves of the stall" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-23.htm">Luke 15:23</a>). The fat beef implies a sumptuous and magnificent entertainment; but such a feast is little worth if accompanied with feelings of hatred, jealousy, and ill will. This and the preceding verse emphasize and explain ver. 15. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:16,17. Believers often have enough when worldly eyes see little; the Lord is with them, without the cares, troubles, and temptations which are with the wealth of the wicked. 18. He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate, they are not likely to bring any thing to pass. 23. Wisdom is needed to suit our discourse to the occasions. 24. A good man sets his affections on things above; his way leads directly thither.</body></html>
