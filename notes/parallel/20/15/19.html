The word for "thorn" here is <span class="accented">chedek.</span> It occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>, where the Authorized Version has "briar;" but the particular plant intended is not ascertained. Most writers consider it to be some spinous specimen of the <span class="accented">solanum.</span> The word refers, it is thought, to a class of plants the name of one of which, at least, the miscalled "apple of Sodom," is well known in poetry, and is a proverbial expression for anything which promises fair but utterly disappoints on trial. "This plant, which is really a kind of potato, grows everywhere in the warmer parts of Palestine, rising to a widely branching shrub from three to five feet high; the wood thickly set with spines; the flower like that of the potato, and the fruit, which is larger than the potato apple, perfectly round, and changing from yellow to bright red as it ripens.... The <span class="accented">osher</span> of the Arab is the true apple of Sodom. A very tropical-looking plant, its fruit is like a large smooth apple or orange, and hangs in clusters of three or four together. When ripe, it is yellow, and looks fair and attractive, and is soft to the touch, but if pressed, it bursts with a crack, and only the broken shell and a raw of small seeds in a half-open pod, with a few dry filaments, remain in the hand" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:74, 117). Cato, 'Dist.,' 54:3, 5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Segnitiem fugito, quae vitae ignavia fertur;<br />Nam quum animus languet, consumit inertia corpus."</span> To the sluggard is opposed the righteous in the second member, because indolence is a grievous sin, and the greatest contrast to the active industry of the man who fears God and does his duty. <span class="cmt_word">The way of the righteous is made plain;</span> "is a raised causeway;" <span class="accented">selulah</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-17.htm">Proverbs 16:17</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>. The upright man, who treads the path appointed for him resolutely and trustfully, finds all difficulties vanish; before him the thorns yield a passage; and that which the sluggard regarded as dangerous and impassable becomes to him as the king's highway. Vulgate, "The path of the just is without impediment;" Septuagint, "The roads of the manly (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) are well beaten." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 30:51), "Whatever adversity may have fallen in their way of life, the righteous stumble not against it. Because with the bound of eternal hope, and of eternal contemplation, they leap over the obstacles of temporal adversity" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-29.htm">Psalm 18:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:16,17. Believers often have enough when worldly eyes see little; the Lord is with them, without the cares, troubles, and temptations which are with the wealth of the wicked. 18. He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate, they are not likely to bring any thing to pass. 23. Wisdom is needed to suit our discourse to the occasions. 24. A good man sets his affections on things above; his way leads directly thither.</body></html>
