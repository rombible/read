The "ear" is put for the person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-11.htm" title="When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:">Job 29:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ear that heareth</span> (hearkeneth to) <span class="cmt_word">the reproof of life abideth among the wise</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>). The reproof, or instruction, of life is that which teaches the true way of pleasing God, which is indeed the only life worth living. The ear, by synecdoche, is put for the person. One who attends to and profits by such admonition may be reckoned among the wise, and rejoices to be conversant with them. Wordsworth finds a more recondite sense here: the ear of the wise dwells, lodges, passes the night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-23.htm">Proverbs 19:23</a>) in their heart, whereas the heart of fools is in their mouth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>). This verse is omitted in the Septuagint, though it is found in the other Greek versions and the Latin Vulgate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:29. God sets himself at a distance from those who set him at defiance. 30. How delightful to the humbled soul to hear the good report of salvation by the Lord Jesus Christ! 31. Faithful, friendly reproofs help spiritual life, and lead to eternal life. 32. Sinners undervalue their own souls; therefore they prefer the body before the soul, and wrong the soul to please the body. 33. The fear of the Lord will dispose us to search the Scriptures with reverence; and it will cause us to follow the leadings of the Holy Spirit. While we humbly place all our dependence on the grace of God, we are exalted in the righteousness of Christ.</body></html>
