(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm" title="Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.">Proverbs 27:20</a>.) "Destruction" (<span class= "ital">Abaddon</span>) is the lowest hell, corresponding to the "abyss" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm" title="And they sought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.">Luke 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-11.htm" title="And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon.">Revelation 9:11</a>; the abode of evil spirits and the lost. (For the thought, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm" title="Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.">Job 26:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm" title="If I ascend up into heaven, you are there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there.">Psalm 139:8</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hell and destruction are before the Lord.</span> The two words rendered "hell" and "destruction" are respectively <span class="accented">Sheol</span> and <span class="accented">Abaddon, Infernus</span> and <span class="accented">Perditio</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>). The former is used generally as the place to which the souls of the dead are consigned - the receptacle of all departed spirits, whether good or bad. Abaddon is the lowest depth of hell, the "abyss" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-2.htm">Revelation 9:2</a>, etc.; 20:l, etc. The clause means that God's eye penetrates even the most secret corners of the unseen world. As Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>) says, "Sheol is naked before him, and Abaddon hath no covering" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">How much more then the hearts of the children of men?</span> (For the form of the expression, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a> and Proverbs 19:7; and for the import, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>.) If God knows the secrets of the world beyond the grave, much more does he know the secret thoughts of men on earth. The heart is the source of action (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:11. There is nothing that can be hid from the eyes of God, not even man's thoughts. 12. A scorner cannot bear to reflect seriously within his own heart. 13. A gloomy, impatient, unthankful spirit, springing from pride and undue attachment to worldly objects, renders a man uneasy to himself and others.</body></html>
