The LXX. takes the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> in its other signification of "binding" or "embracing," and translates, "The lips of the wise are bound (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) with knowledge;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> knowledge is always on them and controls their movements. The wise know when to speak, when to be silent, and what to say. <span class="cmt_word">But the heart of the foolish doeth not so</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> doth not disperse knowledge. Vulgate, <span class="accented">cor stultorum dissimile erit</span>, "will be unlike," which probably means the same as the Authorized Version. (Compare a similar use of the words <span class="accented">lo-ken</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-18.htm">Genesis 48:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-11.htm">Exodus 10:11</a>.) But the contrast is stated rather weakly by this rendering, lips and heart having the same office to perform; hence it is better, with Delitzsch, Ewald, and others, to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ken</span>) as an adjective in the sense of "right" or "trustworthy," and either to supply the former verb, "disperseth that which is not right," or to render, "The heart of the foot is not directed right;" the fool goes astray, and leads himself and others into error. Septuagint, "The hearts of fools are not safe (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:3. Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God's eye. This speaks comfort to saints, and terror to sinners. 4. A good tongue is healing to wounded consciences, by comforting them; to sin-sick souls, by convincing them; and it reconciles parties at variance. 5. If instruction is despised, reprove men rather than suffer them to go on undisturbed in the way to ruin. 6. The wealth of worldly men increases their fears and suspicions, adds strength to their passions, and renders the fear of death more distressing. 7. We use knowledge aright when we disperse it; but the heart of the foolish has nothing to disperse that is good. 8,9. The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or in the place of holy obedience. Praying graces are his gift, and the work of his Spirit, with which he is well pleased. 10. He that hates reproof shall perish in his sins, since he would not be parted from them.</body></html>
