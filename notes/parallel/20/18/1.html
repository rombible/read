The Authorized Version gives, <span class="cmt_word">Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a man who has an earnest desire for self-improvement will hold himself aloof from worldly entanglements, and, occupying himself wholly in this pursuit, will become conversant with all wisdom. This gives good sense, and offers a contrast to the fool in ver. 2, who "hath no delight in understanding." But the Hebrew does not rightly bear this interpretation. Its conciseness occasions ambiguity. Literally, <span class="accented">For his desire a man who separates himself seeks</span>; <span class="accented">in</span> (or <span class="accented">against</span>) <span class="accented">all wisdom he mingles himself.</span> There is a doubt whether the life of isolation is praised or censured in this verse. Aben Ezra and others of Pharisaic tendencies adopt the former alternative, and explain pretty much as the Authorized Version, thus: "He who out of love of wisdom divorces himself from home, country, or secular pursuits, such a man will mix with the wise and prudent, and be conversant with such." But the maxim seems rather to blame this separation, though here, again, there is a variety of interpretation. Delitzsch, Ewald, and others translate, "He that dwelleth apart seeketh pleasure, against all sound wisdom he showeth his teeth" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>). Nowack, after Bertheau, renders, "He who separates himself goes after his own desire; with all that is useful he falls into a rage." Thus the maxim is directed against the conceited, self-willed man, who sets himself against public opinion, delights in differing from received customs, takes no counsel from others, thinks nothing of public interests, but in his mean isolation attends only to his own private ends and fancies (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate (followed by Hitzig) read in the first clause, for <span class="accented">taavah</span>, "desire<span class="accented"></span>," <span class="accented">taanah</span>, "occasion;" thus: "He who wishes to separate from a friend seeks occasions; but at all time he will be worthy of censure." The word translated "wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyah</span>) also means "substance," "existence;" hence the rendering, "at all time," <span class="accented">omni existentia</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">omni tempore.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1 If we would get knowledge and grace, we must try all methods of improving ourselves. 2. Those make nothing to purpose, of learning or religion, whose only design is to have something to make a show with. 3. As soon as sin entered, shame followed.</body></html>
