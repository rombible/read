As the LXX. interprets, "When the wicked cometh into the depth of evil, he despiseth," he turns a despiser. So the Vulgate. Going forward in evil, adding sin to sin, he end by casting all shame aside, deriding the Law Divine and human, and saying in his heart, "There is no God." St. Gregory, "As he who is plunged into a well is confined to the bottom of it; so would the mind fall in, and remain, as it were, at the bottom, if, after having once fallen, it were to confine itself within any measure of sin. But when it cannot be contented with the sin into which it has fallen, while it is daily plunging into worse offences, it finds, as it were, no bottom to the well into which it has fallen, on which to rest. For there would be a bottom to the well, if there were any bounds to his sin. Whence it is well said, 'When a sinner hath come into the lowest depth of sins, he contemneth.' For he puts by returning, because he has no hope that he can be forgiven. But when he sins still more through despair, he withdraws, as it were, the bottom from the well, so as to find therein no resting place" ('Moral.,' 26:69, Oxford transl.). Even the heathen could see this terrible consequence. Thus Juvenal is quoted ('Sat.,' 13:240, etc.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nam quis<br />Peccandi finem posuit sibi? quando receipt<br />Ejectum semel attrita de fronte ruborem?<br />Quisnam hominum est, quem tu contentum videris uno<br />Flagitio?"</span> <span class="cmt_word">And with ignominy cometh reproach.</span> Here again it is not the reproach suffered by the sinner that is meant (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>), but the abuse which he heaps on others who strive to impede him in his evil courses. All that he says or does brings disgrace, and he is always ready to revue any who are better than himself. Both the Septuagint and the Vulgate make the wicked man the victim instead of the actor, thus: "but upon him there cometh disgrace and reproach." The Hebrew does not well admit this interpretation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1 If we would get knowledge and grace, we must try all methods of improving ourselves. 2. Those make nothing to purpose, of learning or religion, whose only design is to have something to make a show with. 3. As soon as sin entered, shame followed.</body></html>
