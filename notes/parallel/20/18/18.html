If this verse is taken in connection with the preceding, it refers to the decision in doubtful cases, where the evidence is conflicting and ordinary investigation fails to elicit the truth satisfactorily. The lot, being considered to show the judgment of God, settled the question. <span class="cmt_word">And parteth between the mighty.</span> If it were not for the decision by lot, persons of eminence and power would settle their differences by violent means. This peaceful solution obviates all such contentions. The Septuagint, in place of "lot" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), reads now <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "silent;" but it is evidently originally a clerical error, perpetuated by copyists. The error is noted by a second hand in the margin of the Sinaitic Manuscript. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:17. It is well to listen to our enemies, that we may form a better judgment of ourselves. 18. It was customary sometimes to refer matters to God, by casting lots, with solemn prayer. The profaning the lot, by using it in matters of diversion, or coveting what belongs to others, forms an objection to this now.</body></html>
