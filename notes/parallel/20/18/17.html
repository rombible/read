Thus the maxims, "One story is good till the other is told," and "Audi alteram partem," receive confirmation. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Justus prior est accusator sui.</span> So Septuagint, "The righteous is his own accuser in opening the suit (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>)." He cuts the ground from under the adversary's feet by at once owning his fault. St. Gregory more than once, in his 'Moralia,' adduces this rendering. Thus on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>, "To put the mouth to labour is to employ it in the confession of sin done, but the righteous man doth not refrain his mouth, in that, forestalling the wrath of the searching Judge, he falls wroth upon himself in words of self-confession. Hence it is written, 'The just man is first the accuser of himself'" (so lib. 22:33). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:17. It is well to listen to our enemies, that we may form a better judgment of ourselves. 18. It was customary sometimes to refer matters to God, by casting lots, with solemn prayer. The profaning the lot, by using it in matters of diversion, or coveting what belongs to others, forms an objection to this now.</body></html>
