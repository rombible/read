A man that does his work in some sort, but not heartily and diligently, as one who knows that labour is not only a duty and necessity, but a means of sanctification, a training for a higher life. <span class="cmt_word">Is brother to him that is a great waster</span>; a destroyer. "Brother" is used as "companion" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-24.htm">Proverbs 28:24</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>), for one of like attributes and tendencies; as we say, "next door to;" and the destroyer is, as Nowack says, not merely one who wastes his property by reckless expenditure, but one who delights in such destruction, finds a morbid pleasure in haves and ruin. So the maxim asserts that remissness in duty is as mischievous as actual destructiveness. "An idle brain," say the Italians, "is the devil's workshop." The word rendered "great" is <span class="accented">baal</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>), "owner," <span class="accented">patrono</span> (Montanus), <span class="accented">domino</span> (Vatablus); and, taking this sense, according to Wordsworth and others, the sentence implies that the servant who is slothful is brother to a master who is a prodigal. But the interpretation given above is best founded. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;</span> instead of, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5d4;</span>, renders, "He who healeth not (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) himself in his works is brother to him who destroyeth himself." Maxims concerning laziness are found in other places; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-21.htm">Proverbs 23:21</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:4. The well-spring of wisdom in the heart of a believer, continually supplies words of wisdom. 5. The merits of a cause must be looked to, not the person. 6,7. What mischief bad men do to themselves by their ungoverned tongues! 8. How base are those that sow contention! and what fatal effects may be expected from small beginnings of jealousy! 9. Omissions of duty, and in duty, are fatal to the soul, as well as commissions of sin. 10,11. The Divine power, made known in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, forms a strong tower for the believer, who relies on the Lord. How deceitful the defence of the rich man, who has his portion and treasure in this world! It is a strong city and a high wall only in his own conceit; for it will fail when most in need. They will be exposed to the just wrath of that Judge whom they despised as a Saviour. 12. After the heart has been lifted up with pride, a fall comes. But honour shall be the reward of humility. 13. Eagerness, with self-conceit, will expose to shame. 14. Firmness of mind supports under many pains and trials. But when the conscience is tortured with remorse, no human fortitude can bear the misery; what then will hell be? 15. We must get knowledge, not only into our heads, but into our hearts. 16. Blessed be the Lord, who makes us welcome to come to his throne, without money and without price. May his gifts make room for him in our souls.</body></html>
