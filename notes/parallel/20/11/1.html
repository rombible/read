The repetition suggests that this form of cheating had become common in the time of Solomon, when the commerce of Israel began to develop. If so, there would be good reason for these frequent warnings, for it would have been useless to raise the superstructure of a religious life, as is the intention of this book, without first laying the foundation of common honesty between man and man.<p><span class= "bld">A just weight.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">stone, </span>stones having been used for weights from early times. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-36.htm" title="Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall you have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.">Leviticus 19:36</a>.) A standard weight, "the king's stone," seems to have been kept by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm" title="And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.">2Samuel 14:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A false balance;</span> literally, <span class="accented">balances of deceit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>). The repetition of the injunctions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13, 14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35, 36</a> points to fraud consequent on increased commercial dealings, and the necessity of moral and religious considerations to control practices which the civil authority could not adequately supervise. The standard weights and measures were deposited in the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-25.htm">Leviticus 27:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-29.htm">1 Chronicles 23:29</a>), but cupidity was not to be restrained by law, and the prophets had continually to inveigh against this besetting sin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-10.htm">Ezekiel 45:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>). Honesty and integrity are at the foundation of social duties, which the author is now teaching. Hence comes the reiteration of these warnings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-10.htm">Proverbs 20:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A just weight;</span> literally, a perfect stone, stones having been used as weights from early times. So we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm">2 Samuel 14:26</a>) that Absalom weighed his hair "by the king's stone" (<span class="accented">eben</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1 However men may make light of giving short weight or measure, and however common such crimes may be, they are an abomination to the Lord. 2. Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.</body></html>
