The LXX. translates freely, "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" a rendering adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-18.htm" title="And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?">1Peter 4:18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The righteous shall be recompensed in the earth.</span> Them are two ways of understanding this verse. The word rendered "recompensed," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5b7;</span>(<span class="accented">shalam</span>), is a <span class="accented">vox media</span>, and can be taken either in a good or bad sense. So the meaning will be, "The righteous meets with his reward upon earth, much more the sinner," the "reward" of the latter being, of course, punishment. But the versions lead to another interpretation, by which "recompensed" is rendered "chastised;" and the meaning is - if even the righteous shall be punished for their trespasses, as Moses, David, etc., how much more the wicked! The Septuagint, quoted exactly by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-18.htm">1 Peter 4:18</a>) has, "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:28. The true believer is a branch of the living Vine. When those that take root in the world wither, those who are grafted into Christ shall be fruitful. 29. He that brings trouble upon himself and his family, by carelessness, or by wickedness, shall be unable to keep and enjoy what he gets, as a man is unable to hold the wind, or to satisfy himself with it. 30. The righteous are as trees of life; and their influence upon earth, like the fruits of that tree, support and nourish the spiritual life in many. 31. Even the righteous, when they offend on earth, shall meet with sharp corrections; much more will the wicked meet the due reward of their sins. Let us then seek those blessings which our Surety purchased by his sufferings and death; let us seek to copy his example, and to keep his commandments.</body></html>
