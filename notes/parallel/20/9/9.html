Vulgate and Septuagint, "Give an opportunity to a wise man, and he will be wiser" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-29.htm">Matthew 25:29</a>). To make the best use of all occasions of learning duty, whether they present themselves in a winning or a forbidden shape, is the part of one who is wise unto salvation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>, and note there). <span class="cmt_word">Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</span> Wisdom being a moral and not merely an intellectual, quality. there is a natural interchange of "wise" and "just," referring to the same individual, in the two clauses. Vulgate, <span class="accented">festinabit accipere</span>; Septuagint, "Instruct a wise man, and he shall have more given him." The wise are thus rewarded with larger measures of wisdom, because they are simple, humble, and willing to learn, having that childlike spirit which Christ commends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Christ has prepared ordinances to which his people are admitted, and by which nourishment is given here to those that believe in him, as well as mansions in heaven hereafter. The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.</body></html>
