It is not an unusual custom in the Old Testament to describe intimate communion with God, and the refreshment which the soul of man thereby receives, under the figure of a festival. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-11.htm" title="And on the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.">Exodus 24:11</a>, when the elders of Israel were admitted to the vision of the Almighty, they "did eat and drink." The same idea occurs frequently in the prophets also (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-13.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be ashamed:">Isaiah 65:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zephaniah/1-7.htm" title="Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests.">Zephaniah 1:7-8</a>); and is brought out in the New Testament with great fulness in the parables of the great supper (Luke 14) and the marriage of the king's son (Matthew 22). Christ, the supreme Wisdom, has "builded His house" by taking man's flesh at His Incarnation, and thus rearing for Himself a "temple of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>); and also by building for Himself a "spiritual house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>), "the house of God, which is the church of the living God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1Timothy 3:15</a>). (For references to the Fathers, see Bishop Wordsworth.) In the previous chapter Christ's work as Creator was described; now He is set forth as Regenerator of mankind.<p><span class= "bld">She hath hewn out her seven pillars.--</span>Suggestive of the sevenfold gifts of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm" title="John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;">Revelation 1:4</a>), typified by the seven-branched candlestick of the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm" title="And you shall make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.">Exodus 25:37</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-18.</span> - 15. <span class="accented">Fifteenth admonitory discourse</span>, containing in a parabolic form an invitation of Wisdom (vers. 1-12), and that of her rival Folly (vers. 13-18). The chapter sums up in brief the warnings of the preceding part. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Wisdom was represented as having a house at whose portals persons waited eagerly for admission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-34.htm">Proverbs 8:34</a>); the idea is further carried on. <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom hath builded her house.</span> (For the plural form of <span class="accented">khochmoth</span>, "wisdom," a plural of excellency, see on Proverbs 1:20.) As the "strange woman" in ch. 7. possessed a house to which she seduced her victim, so Wisdom is represented as having a house which she has made and adorned, and to which she invites her pupils. Spiritual writers see here two references - one to Christ's incarnation, when he built for himself a human body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>); and another to his work in forming the Church, which is his mystical body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). And the sublime language used in this section is not satisfied with the bare notion that we have here only an allegorical representation of Wisdom calling followers to her. Rather we are constrained to see a Divine intimation of the office and work of Christ, not only the Creator of the world, as in ch. 8, but its Regenerator. <span class="cmt_word">She hath hewn out her seven pillars</span>. Architecturally, according to Hitzig and others, the pillars of the inner court are meant, which supported the gallery of the first story. Four of these were m the corners, three in the middle of three sides, while the entrance to the court was through the fourth side of the square. The number seven generally denotes perfection; it is the covenant number, expressive of harmony and unity generally, the signature of holiness and blessing, completeness and rest. So in the Apocalypse the whole Church is represented by the number of seven Churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, etc.; see on Proverbs 26:16). Wisdom's house is said to be thus founded because of its perfection and adaptability to all states of men. But doubtless there is a reference to the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Spirit, which rested upon the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, etc.), and which are the support and strength of the Church, being symbolized by the seven-branched candlestick in the temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Christ has prepared ordinances to which his people are admitted, and by which nourishment is given here to those that believe in him, as well as mansions in heaven hereafter. The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.</body></html>
