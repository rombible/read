But the King (Matthew 22) despatches His servants for the same work, viz., His prophets and wise men and scribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm" title="Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:">Matthew 23:34</a>), whom from age to age He sends forth as His messengers.<p><span class= "bld">She crieth upon the highest places of the city--</span>so that all may hear.

The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "her servants," but the Authorized Version is correct, and feminine attendants are in strict harmony with the rest of the apologue. By them are represented the apostles and preachers and ministers, who go forth to win souls for Christ. St. Gregory sees in their being called "maidens" an intimation that they are in themselves weak and abject, and are only useful and honoured as being the mouthpiece of their Lord ('Moral.,' 33:33). <span class="cmt_word">She crieth upon the highest places of the city,</span> where her voice could best be heard, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>. She is not satisfied with delegating her message to others; she delivers it herself. Septuagint, "calling with a loud proclamation to the cup (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Misit ancillas suas ut vocarent ad arcem et ad moenia civitatis</span>, "She has sent her handmaids to invite to the citadel, and to the wails of the town." On which rendering St. Gregory comments, "In that while they tell of the interior life, they lift us up to the high walls of the city above, which same walls, surely, except any be humble, they do not ascend" ('Moral.,' 17:43). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Christ has prepared ordinances to which his people are admitted, and by which nourishment is given here to those that believe in him, as well as mansions in heaven hereafter. The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.</body></html>
