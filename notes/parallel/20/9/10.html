Without the fear of God no teaching is of any avail. <span class="cmt_word">The knowledge of the holy is understanding.</span> The word translated "the holy" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, a plural of excellence (see on Proverbs 30:3) like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and equivalent to "the Most Holy One," Jehovah, to which it answers in the first hemistich. God is called "Holy, holy, holy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>), in his threefold nature, and as majestic beyond expression. The only knowledge worth having, and which is of avail for the practical purposes of life, is the knowledge of God (see on Proverbs 2:5). Septuagint, "The counsel of the holy (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is understanding," with the explanatory clause; "for to know the Law is the character of good thought." This occurs again at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>, though in the Hebrew in neither place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Christ has prepared ordinances to which his people are admitted, and by which nourishment is given here to those that believe in him, as well as mansions in heaven hereafter. The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.</body></html>
