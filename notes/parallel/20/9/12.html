Wisdom will bring thee good; as thou hast laboured well, so will be thy reward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>). The LXX. (Syriac and Arabic), with the idea of perfecting the antithesis, adds, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "My son, if thou art wise for thyself, thou shalt be wise also for thy neighbours" - which contains the great truth that good gifts should not be selfishly enjoyed, but used and dispensed for the advantage of others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>). In support of our text we may quote <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>, "Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself." <span class="cmt_word">But if thou scornest, thou alone shalt hear it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> atone for it, bear the sin, as it is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-13.htm">Numbers 9:13</a>, "Forevery man shall bear his own burden" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>). Thus Wisdom ends her exhortation. Septuagint, "If thou turn out evil, thou alone shalt bear (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) evils." And then is added the following paragraph, which may possibly be derived from a Hebrew original, but seems more like a congeries made up from other passages, and foisted by some means into the Greek text: "He that stayeth himself on lies shepherdeth winds, and himself pursueth flying birds; for he hath left the ways of his own vineyard, and hath gone astray with the wheels of his own husbandry; and he goeth through a waterless desert, and over a land set in thirsty places, and with his hands he gathereth unfruitfulness." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Christ has prepared ordinances to which his people are admitted, and by which nourishment is given here to those that believe in him, as well as mansions in heaven hereafter. The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.</body></html>
