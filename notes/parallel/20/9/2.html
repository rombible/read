Hippolytus (ed. Lagarde, p. 199), quoted by Wordsworth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She hath killed her beasts.</span> So in the parable of the marriage of the king's son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>, which is parallel to the present), the king sends his servants to notify the guests that the oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Wisdom has stores of nourishment for understanding and affection; and Christ has offered himself as a Victim in our behalf, and now makes bounteous offers of grace, and especially has ordained the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for the strengthening and refreshing of the soul. <span class="cmt_word">She hath mingled her wine;</span> Septuagint, "She hath mixed (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) her wine in a bowl." The wine which, untempered, was too luscious or too fiery to drink, was made palatable by a certain admixture of water, it was always so mixed at the Passover; and the ancient Christian Liturgies direct the mixture in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, doubtless from traditional use. Some, however, think that allusion is here made to the custom of adding drugs to wine in order to increase its potency. Among the Greeks, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> meant "wine without water," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "undiluted wine mixed." And probably in the text the notion is that the fluid for the guests' delectation is properly prepared, that there may be no trouble when they arrive (see on Proverbs 23:30). <span class="cmt_word">She hath also furnished her table,</span> by arranging the dishes, etc., thereon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, "Thou preparest a table before me," where the same verb, <span class="accented">arak</span>, is used; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>). Moralizing on this passage, St. Gregory says, "The Lord 'killed the sacrifices' by offering himself on our behalf. He 'mingled the wine,' blending together the cup of his precepts from the historical narration and the spiritual signification. And he 'set forth his table,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Holy Writ, which with the bread of the Word refreshes us when we are wearied and come to him away from the burdens of the world, and by its effect of refreshing strengthens us against our adversaries" ('Moral,' 17:43, Oxford transl.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Christ has prepared ordinances to which his people are admitted, and by which nourishment is given here to those that believe in him, as well as mansions in heaven hereafter. The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.</body></html>
