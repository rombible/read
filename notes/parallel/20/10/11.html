But perhaps it will be better here to interpret the second line in the sense of "the mouth of the godless hideth violence," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>it conceals under deceitful words the mischief intended for others. With God is the "well of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm" title="For with you is the fountain of life: in your light shall we see light.">Psalm 36:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-17.htm" title="And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely.">Revelation 22:17</a>); and in like manner the "mouth of the righteous" brings comfort and refreshment to the weary and heavy laden.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A well of life</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>: 18:4). The good man utters words of wisdom, comfort, and edification. God himself is said to have "the well of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>), and to be "the Fountain of living waters" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>): and the holy man, drawing from this supply, sheds life and health around. The second clause should be takes as in Ver. 6, <span class="cmt_word">but the mouth of the wicked concealeth violence,</span> the contrast being between the open usefulness of the good man's words and the harmful reticence of the malicious sinner. The Septuagint has, "A fountain of life is in the hand of the righteous; but destruction shall cover the mouth of the wicked." This is explained to mean that a good man's words and actions tend to spiritual health; a bad man's words bring down sorrow and punishment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:7. Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there is a vast difference. 8. The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice. 9. Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed. 10. Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity. 11. The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correct others. 12. Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife. By bearing with each other, peace and harmony are preserved. 13. Those that foolishly go on in wicked ways, prepare rods for themselves. 14. Whatever knowledge may be useful, we must lay it up, that it may not be to seek when we want it. The wise gain this wisdom by reading, by hearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. 15. This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to their outward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers; while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a good conscience, and lives by faith. 16. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, but that labour tends to life. 17. The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told of it, and to be shown the right way, must err still. 18. He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; and malice is no better. 19. Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is a wise man, and therein consults his own peace. 20,21. The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.</body></html>
