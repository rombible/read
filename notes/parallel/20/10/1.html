A COLLECTION OF 375 SEPARATE VERSES ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS, MARKED BY A NEW HEADING (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm" title="The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.">Proverbs 10:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-16.htm" title="He that oppresses the poor to increase his riches, and he that gives to the rich, shall surely come to want.">Proverbs 22:16</a>).<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The proverbs of Solomon.--</span>The new title and different style of composition mark a new collection of proverbs. (See above, in the <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) Each verse is distinct and complete in itself; but the collector appears to have endeavoured to throw together such as touched on the same subject. For instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/10-4.htm" title="He becomes poor that deals with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent makes rich.">Proverbs 10:4-5</a>, show why one man fails and another succeeds; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/10-6.htm" title="Blessings are on the head of the just: but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.">Proverbs 10:6-7</a>, how blessings and curses follow different persons. But the connection is sometimes so slight as to be difficult to catch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 22:16.</span> - Part III. FIRST GREAT COLLECTION (375) OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 12:28.</span> - First section. The sections are noted by their commencing usually with the words, "a wise son." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The proverbs of Solomon.</span> This is the title of the new part of the book; it is omitted in the Septuagint. There is some kind of loose connection in the grouping of these proverbs, but it is difficult to follow. "Ordo frustra quaeritur ubi nullus fuit observatus," says Mart. Geier. Wordsworth considers the present chapter to contain exemplifications of the principles and results of the two ways of life displayed in the preceding nine chapters. The antithetical character of the sentences is most marked and well sustained. As the book is specially designed for the edification of youth, it begins with an appropriate saying. <span class="cmt_word">A wise son maketh a glad father.</span> As wisdom comprises all moral excellence, and folly is vice and perversity, the opposite characters attributed to the son are obvious. The mother is introduced for the sake of parallelism; though some commentators suggest that as the father would be naturally elated by his son's virtues, which would conduce to honour and high estate, so the mother would be grieved at vices which her training had not subdued, and her indulgence had fostered. If this seems somewhat far-fetched, we may consider that the father in the maxim includes the mother, and the mother the father, the two being separated for the purpose of contrast (see on Proverbs 26:3). The word for heaviness occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a> and Proverbs 17:21. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1 The comfort of parents much depends on their children; and this suggests to both, motives to their duties. 2,3. Though the righteous may be poor, the Lord will not suffer him to want what is needful for spiritual life. 4. Those who are fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, are likely to be rich in faith, and rich in good works. 5. Here is just blame of those who trifle away opportunities, both for here and for hereafter. 6. Abundance of blessings shall abide on good men; real blessings.</body></html>
