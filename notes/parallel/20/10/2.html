But a "righteous" man in Hebrew is one who "renders to all their due," whether to God, as Noah, who was "just and perfect" before Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm" title="For there is not a just man on earth, that does good, and sins not.">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>), or to man. To his fellow-men his "justice" will show itself in liberality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-21.htm" title="The wicked borrows, and pays not again: but the righteous shows mercy, and gives.">Psalm 37:21</a>), mercy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-10.htm" title="A righteous man regards the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.">Proverbs 12:10</a>), carefulness of speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-28.htm" title="The heart of the righteous studies to answer: but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.">Proverbs 15:28</a>), truthfulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-5.htm" title="A righteous man hates lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and comes to shame.">Proverbs 13:5</a>), and wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-9.htm" title="Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.">Proverbs 9:9</a>). He is considerate to animals also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-10.htm" title="A righteous man regards the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.">Proverbs 12:10</a>). So in the sermon on the Mount our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a>) says, "Take heed that ye do not your 'righteousness' [so the best MSS. read] before men;" and then specifies it under the heads of almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. In this passage it forms a contrast to riches gained by wrong, and therefore would seem particularly to signify "almsgiving," as its Greek equivalent does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2Corinthians 9:10</a>. It is often: rendered so by the LXX., and it is the most usual sense of the word in late Hebrew. It is so interpreted also in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/tobit/4-10.htm" title="Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.">Tobit 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-9.htm" title="For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled with life:">Tobit 12:9</a>, where this passage is quoted. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/3-30.htm" title="Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins.">Ecclesiasticus 3:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/29-12.htm" title="Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver thee from all affliction.">Ecclesiasticus 29:12</a>, and our Lord's advice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>.) It "delivers from death," as being a sign of the divine life within, which is "hid with Christ in God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Treasures of wickedness;</span> treasures acquired by wrong doing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Profit nothing</span> "in the day of calamity" (Ecclus. 5:8; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>). The LXX. renders, "Treasures will not profit the wicked;" so Aquila. "For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>); not simply justice and moral goodness, but more especially liberality, benevolence. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a> the Revised Version (in accordance with the best manuscripts) reads, "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them," Christ proceeding to specify three outward acts as coming under this term, viz. almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. In some analogous passages the LXX. renders the word by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>; Tobit 12:9 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delivereth from death,</span> shows that a man's heart is right towards God. and calls down special grace. Such a man lays up in store for himself a good foundation, that he may attain eternal life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-19.htm">1 Timothy 6:19</a>; see on Proverbs 16:6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1 The comfort of parents much depends on their children; and this suggests to both, motives to their duties. 2,3. Though the righteous may be poor, the Lord will not suffer him to want what is needful for spiritual life. 4. Those who are fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, are likely to be rich in faith, and rich in good works. 5. Here is just blame of those who trifle away opportunities, both for here and for hereafter. 6. Abundance of blessings shall abide on good men; real blessings.</body></html>
