This is usually explained to mean either that the consciousness of his own iniquity silences the sinner when he would speak against the righteous, or his violence and injustice, returning on his own head, are like a bandage over his mouth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>), reducing him to shame and silence. Others, again, consider the signification to be - in default of the good, honest words which should proceed from a man's mouth, the sinner pours forth injustice and wickedness. But it is best (as in Ver. 14) to take "mouth" as the subject: "The mouth of the wicked concealeth violence," that he may wait for the opportunity of practising it. The contrast is between the manifest blessedness of the righteous and the secret sinister proceedings of the evil. The Vulgate and Septuagint give, "the blessing of the Lord." For "violence" the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "untimely grief;" the Hebrew word <span class="accented">chamas</span> bearing also the sense of "misery." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1 The comfort of parents much depends on their children; and this suggests to both, motives to their duties. 2,3. Though the righteous may be poor, the Lord will not suffer him to want what is needful for spiritual life. 4. Those who are fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, are likely to be rich in faith, and rich in good works. 5. Here is just blame of those who trifle away opportunities, both for here and for hereafter. 6. Abundance of blessings shall abide on good men; real blessings.</body></html>
