The soul is the life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-25.htm">Proverbs 13:25</a>). So the psalmist says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>), "I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread." Christ speaks of the providence that watches over the lower creatures, and draws thence a lesson of trust in his care of man. concluding, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26, 33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he casteth away the substance of the wicked;</span> Septuagint, "He will overthrew the life of the wicked;" Vulgate, "He overturns the plots of sinners." The word rendered "substance" (<span class="accented">havvah</span>) is better understood as "desire." God frustrates the eager longing (for food or other good things) of the wicked; they are never satisfied, and get no real enjoyment out of what they crave (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-25.htm">Proverbs 13:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1 The comfort of parents much depends on their children; and this suggests to both, motives to their duties. 2,3.

Here is just blame of those who trifle away opportunities, both for here and for hereafter. 6. Abundance of blessings shall abide on good men; real blessings.</body></html>
