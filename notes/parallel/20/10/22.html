The Septuagint adds, "upon the head of the righteous," as in Ver. 6. Not chance and luck, not even industry and labour, but God giveth the increase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He addeth no sorrow with it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with the Blessing. In acquiring and in using wealth thus blessed, the good man is contented and happy, while unsanctified fiches bring only trouble and vexation. But this seems rather feeble, and it is better to render, "And a man's own labor addeth nothing thereto." A man's own work must not be regarded as an equal cause of prosperity with the favour of God. This sentiment is in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1, 2</a>, "Except the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that build it so he giveth unto his beloved in sleep" - what others vainly labour for God giveth to the righteous without toil. The rendering of the clause, "Trouble is of no avail without it," is scarcely warranted by the wording of the text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:22. That wealth which is truly desirable, has no vexation of spirit in the enjoyment; no grief for the loss; no guilt by the abuse of it. What comes from the love of God, has the grace of God for its companion. 23. Only foolish and wicked men divert themselves with doing harm to others, or tempting to sin. 24. The largest desire of eternal blessings the righteous can form, will be granted. 25. The course of prosperous sinners is like a whirlwind, which soon spends itself, and is gone. 26. As vinegar sets the teeth on edge, and as the smoke causes the eyes to smart, so the sluggard vexes his employer. 27,28. What man is he that loves life? Let him fear God, and that will secure to him life enough in this world, and eternal life in the other.</body></html>
