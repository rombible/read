This is in agreement with the temporal promise made to the patriarchs and often renewed, as in the fifth commandment. St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>), "Godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come." <span class="cmt_word">The wicked shall not inhabit</span> (or, <span class="accented">abide not in</span>) the land.

The believer grows stronger in faith, and obeys with increased delight. 30. The wicked would be glad to have this earth their home for ever, but it cannot be so. They must die and leave all their idols behind. 31,32. A good man discourses wisely for the benefit of others. But it is the sin, and will be the ruin of a wicked man, that he speaks what is displeasing to God, and provoking to those he converses with. The righteous is kept by the power of God; and nothing shall be able to separate him from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
