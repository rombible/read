(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.">1Peter 5:5</a>, and Christ's commendation of the "poor in spirit," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The enumeration begins with <span class="accented">pride. <span class="cmt_word"></span>A proud look</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">eynayim ramoth</span>); literally, <span class="accented">haughty or lofty eyes</span>, as in the margin; Vulgate, <span class="accented">oculos sublimes</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It is not merely the look which is meant, but the temper of mind which the look expresses (Wardlaw). The lofty look is the indication of the swelling pride which fills the heart, the <span class="accented">mentis elatae tumor</span>, the supreme disdain, <span class="accented">grande supercilium</span>, for everything and everybody. Pride is put first, because it is at the bottom of all disobedience and rebellion against God's laws. It is the very opposite of humility, which the apostle, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>, mentions as the basis, as it were, of all the virtues. All pride is intended, and the face of the Lord is against this pride. He "resisteth the proud;" he "knoweth them afar off;" he "hath respect unto the lowly;" he "will bring down high looks" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-27.htm">Psalm 18:27</a>); he judgeth those that are high (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22</a>). It is against this spirit that Job prays Jehovah "to behold every one that is proud, and abase him," and "to look upon every one that is proud, and bring him low" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-11.htm">Job 40:11, 12</a>). The next thing in the enumeration is a lying tongue. Lying is hateful to God, because he is the God of truth. In a concise form the expression, "a lying tongue," represents what has been already said in vers. 12 and 13 of "the wicked man" who "walks with a froward mouth," and whose conduct is made up of deceit. Lying is the wilful perversion of truth, not only by speech, but by any means whatever whereby a false impression is conveyed to the mind. The liar "sticks not at any lies, flatteries, or calumnies" (Patrick). Lying is elsewhere denounced as the subject which excites the Divine displeasure (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8, 27</a>); and in the early Christian Church, in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, it was punished with death. On the subject of lying, see St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' c. 18, wherein he says, "Mihi autem videtur peccatum quidem esse omne mendacium." Every lie is a sin. The third thing is <span class="cmt_word">hands that shed innocent blood,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a murderous and cruel disposition, which, rather than have its plans frustrated, will imbue the hands with innocent blood, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the blood of those who have done it no injury. The Divine command is, "Thou shall do no murder," and those who break it will find, even if they escape man, that the Lord is "the avenger of blood," and that he "maketh inquisition" for it (cf. ch. 1. and 2, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, which bear a close resemblance to this passage). That the shedding of innocent blood cues for vengeance, and pulls down God's heavy judgments on the murderer, appears in the case of Cain and Abel (Muffet). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-19 If the slothful are to be condemned, who do nothing, much more those that do all the ill they can. Observe how such a man is described. He says and does every thing artfully, and with design. His ruin shall come without warning, and without relief. Here is a list of things hateful to God. Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God, which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which God hates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others. Let us shun all such practices, and watch and pray against them; and avoid, with marked disapproval, all who are guilty of them, whatever may be their rank.</body></html>
