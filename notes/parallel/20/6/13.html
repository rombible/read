In the language of St. Paul, he yields his members to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>). "To wink with the eye (<span class="accented">karats ayin</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>, or "with the eyes (<span class="accented">karats b'eynayim</span>)," is properly to compress or nip them together, and so to wink, and give the signal to others not to interfere (Gesenius and Delitzsch); cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>; and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">annuit oculis.</span> Aquila and Theodoret, however, read, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "he <span class="accented">vexes</span> or <span class="accented">annoys."</span> The observation of the teacher in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a> is, "He that winketh with his eyes causeth sorrow." The same verb <span class="accented">karuts</span> is also used of the compression or closing of the lips in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-30.htm">Proverbs 16:30</a>. <span class="accented">He speaketh with his feet</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he conveys signs by them to his companion; cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f76;</span>, and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">terit pede</span>, which conveys much the same meaning. <span class="accented">He teacheth with his fingers</span>; or, as more fully expressed in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "he teacheth by the signs of his fingers." Symmachus has <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, however, in its strictly classical use (see Demosthenes, 790, 20) is pointing at with the finger. "Teaching" is only the secondary meaning of the Hebrew participle <span class="accented">moreh</span>, which is here used. The verb <span class="accented">yarah</span>, to which it belongs, means properly to extend or stretch out the hand for the purpose of pointing out the way (compare the Hebrew <span class="accented">shalakh yod</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">monstrare</span>), and hence came to mean "to teach." The crafty and deceitful character which is here <span class="accented">presented to as</span> is strikingly reproduced in Ecclesiasticus: "He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him. When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him" (Ecclus. 27:22-24). The heathen poet Naevius says of the impudent woman - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Allium tenet, alii adnutat, alibi manus<br />Est occupata: est alii percellit pedem."</span> Compare also Ovid's words ('Amor.,' 1:4, 16) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Clam mihi tange pedem:<br />Me specta, mutusque meos, vultumque loquacem...<br />Verba superciliis sine voce loquentia dicam;<br />Verba leges digitis."</span> So Tibullus, 1:12 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Illa viro coram nutus conferre loquaces<br />Blandaque compositis abdere verba notis."</span> The lesson which we may learn from this verse is not to abuse the members of our bodies, by employing them for the purposes of deceit and hypocrisy, and so to promote evil, but to put them to their natural and legitimate use. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-19 If the slothful are to be condemned, who do nothing, much more those that do all the ill they can. Observe how such a man is described. He says and does every thing artfully, and with design. His ruin shall come without warning, and without relief. Here is a list of things hateful to God. Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God, which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which God hates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others. Let us shun all such practices, and watch and pray against them; and avoid, with marked disapproval, all who are guilty of them, whatever may be their rank.</body></html>
