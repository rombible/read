The Authorized Version rightly regards this as the conclusion. So the Vulgate. Others, however, carry on the hypothesis, and insert <span class="accented">im</span>, "if:" "If thou art snared," etc.; but without warrant (Zockler, Wordsworth, Plumptre). The LXX. throws the thought into the form of a proverb, as "a strong net to a man are his own words." A distinction is to be drawn between the verbs rendered "entangled" and "taken;" the former, <span class="accented">yakosh</span>, signifying to be taken unwarily, off one's guard; the latter, <span class="accented">lakad</span>, referring, as before observed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), to the being stricken with the net. They are found in the same collocation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>, "Many among them shall be <span class="accented">snared</span> and <span class="accented">taken."</span> The repetition of the phrase, "with the words of thy mouth," is not unintentional or purely rhetorical. It is made, as Delitzsch observes, to bring with greater force to the mind that the entanglements in which the surety is involved are the result of his own indiscretion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 If we live as directed by the word of God, we shall find it profitable even in this present world. We are stewards of our worldly substance, and have to answer to the Lord for our disposal of it; to waste it in rash schemes, or such plans as may entangle us in difficulties and temptations, is wrong. A man ought never to be surety for more than he is able and willing to pay, and can afford to pay, without wronging his family; he ought to look upon every sum he is engaged for, as his own debt. If we must take all this care to get our debts to men forgiven, much more to obtain forgiveness with God. Humble thyself to him, make sure of Christ as thy Friend, to plead for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned, and that thou mayest be kept from going down to the pit.</body></html>
