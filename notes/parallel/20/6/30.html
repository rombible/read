Again, the thief can make retribution, while the adulterer can have none to offer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - The teacher continues his argument with another illustration, still keeping in view his object, which is to show that the punishment of the adulterer is a surely impending one and severe in its character. The argument in vers. 30-33 is one <span class="accented">a fortiori</span>. If men do not overlook but severely punish a crime which has been committed under extenuating circumstances, much less will they do so where the crime is of a much graver character and has nothing to excuse it. Theft and adultery are brought into comparison. Theft under all circumstances is a lesser crime than adultery, but here it is minimized to the lowest degree. The case of a man is taken who steals to satisfy his hunger; the extent of the theft cannot be large, but yet he is punished, and called upon to make the amplest restitution. Much more, does the teacher infer, will be the punishment, and equally certain, where adultery is in question, and the crime is of the most heinous character affecting the most precious interests, and indulged in from the lowest of motives. <span class="cmt_word">Men do not despise a thief,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they do not condemn him under the circumstances, <span class="accented">non grandis est culpa</span> (Vulgate), "the fault is not a great one;" but they do despise an adulterer - him they hold in contempt as one "who lacketh understanding" and destroyeth his own soul (ver. 32). The verb <span class="accented">buz</span> has, however, been otherwise rendered as "to overlook." Zockler and Holden explain, "men do not overlook," though the former gives the literal sense as "men do not despise." Gesenius renders "despise," but explains, "<span class="accented">i.e.</span> they do not let him go unpunished." Vatablus, the Versions, Ariae, Montani, and Munsteri, Hitzig, Delitzsch, and Gesenius, Stuart, Muenscher, and Wordsworth, all agree m regarding the proper meaning of the verb to be "to despise" or "to treat scornfully." The verb <span class="accented">buz</span>, moreover, occurs in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-12.htm">Proverbs 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-9.htm">Proverbs 23:9</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-1.htm">Song of Solomon 8:1, 7</a>. Michaelis's explanation is as follows: "although a theft is deservedly regarded as infamous in the commonwealth, nevertheless, if it be compared with adultery, it is less wicked." The rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "it is not a wonder if any thief be taken," it is difficult to reconcile with the text in the original, though it may be explained as expressing the certainty of arrest which follows theft, and thus gives colour to the secondary meaning attached to the verb, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that of overlooking. The Syriac and Arabic Versions follow the LXX. while the Chaldee Paraphrase renders, "It is not a matter of surprise if a thief steals," etc. <span class="cmt_word">His soul;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">naph'sko</span>. <span class="accented">Nephesh</span> is used here for desire, craving, or appetite, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>. "To satisfy his soul" is "to sustain his life." <span class="accented">Anima</span>, Vulgate; <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, LXX. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:20-35 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions. Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.</body></html>
