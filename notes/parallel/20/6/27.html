The meaning of the verses is plain enough, viz. that as it is in vain to suppose that a person's garment will not be burnt or his feet not be scorched if fire is brought near them, so it is equally inconceivable that a person indulging in adultery can escape its consequences or the retribution that follows. The two questions in vers. 27 and 28 imply a strong negative, and so prepare for the conclusion in ver. 30. <span class="accented">Take fire.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">khathah</span> signifies "<span class="accented">to take</span> burning or live coals <span class="accented">from the hearth"</span> (Placater); and hence is used here in a pregnant sense "to take from the hearth and place in" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>, "For thou wilt take coals ['and heap them:' Hebrew, <span class="accented">gekhalim khotheh</span>] on his head"). The fuller expression is met with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>, "So that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth (<span class="accented">lakh'toth esh miyyakud</span>).'" The Vulgate renders by <span class="accented">abscondere</span>," to hide: <span class="accented">Numquid potest homo absconders ignem</span>; and the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">alligare</span> "to tie or bind fast." Wordsworth explains "to take and heap up, as in a firepan or censer." <span class="cmt_word">In his</span> <span class="cmt_word">bosom;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'kheyko</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">in sinu suo</span>. The word <span class="accented">kheyk</span> is properly "an undulation" (Delitzsch). not the <span class="accented">lap</span>, but as in the Authorized Version here, "the bosom," and "the bosom of a garment" as in ch. 16:33; 17:23; 21:14. The answer to the question of this and the next verse is of course a decided negative, but we may note that the teacher compares adultery to a burning fire in its consequences. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:20-35 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions. Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.</body></html>
