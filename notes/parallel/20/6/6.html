Warning against sloth.</span> The ethical connection of this discourse with the preceding has already been pointed out. Sloth militates against prosperity; it is the prolific parent of want, and, even more surely than suretyship, leads to misfortune and ruin, The certainty with which ruin steals upon the sluggard may be the reason why the teacher closes the discourse in the way he does. In the case of suretyship such an issue is uncertain; there is the possibility of escape, the surety may prevail upon his friend to release him from his obligation, and so he may escape ruin; but with sloth no such contingency is possible, its invariable end is disaster. So far as the grammatical structure of the two discourses is concerned, they appear to be quite independent of each other, the only points of coincidence observable being the repetition of one or two words, which is purely accidental (cf. "go" in vers. 3 and 6, and "sleep" and "slumber" in vers. 4 and 10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</span> The ant (Hebrew, <span class="accented">n'malah</span>) is here brought forward as supplying an example of wisdom to the sluggard. The habits of this insect, its industry and providence, have in all ages made it the symbol of these two qualities, and not only the sacred, but also profane writers have praised its foresight, and held it up for imitation. The ant is only mentioned twice in the Old Testament, and on both occasions in our book (see present passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25</a>). The derivation of <span class="accented">n'malah</span> is either from the root <span class="accented">nam</span>, with reference first to the silence with which it moves, and secondly to its active yet unperceived motion (Delitzsch), or from <span class="accented">namal</span>, <span class="accented">i.q.</span> <span class="accented">malal</span>, "to cut off," from its cutting off or consuming seeds (<span class="accented">ab incidendis seminibus</span>) (Buxtorf, Gesenius). The Aramaic name, <span class="accented">shum'sh'manah</span>, however, points to its activity and rapid running hither and thither (Fleischer). <span class="accented">Sluggard</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">atsel</span>, a verbal adjective tbund only in the Proverbs. The primary idea of the root <span class="accented">atsal</span> is that of languor and laxity. The cognate abstract nouns <span class="accented">ats'lah</span> and <span class="accented">ats'luth</span>, equivalent to "slothfulness," occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27</a>. <span class="accented">Consider her ways</span>; attentively regard them, and from them derive a lesson of wisdom. Her ways are the manner in which the ant displays her industry and foresight. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Diligence in business is every man's wisdom and duty; not so much that he may attain worldly wealth, as that he may not be a burden to others, or a scandal to the church. The ants are more diligent than slothful men. We may learn wisdom from the meanest insects, and be shamed by them. Habits of indolence and indulgence grow upon people. Thus life runs to waste; and poverty, though at first at a distance, gradually draws near, like a traveller; and when it arrives, is like an armed man, too strong to be resisted. All this may be applied to the concerns of our souls. How many love their sleep of sin, and their dreams of worldly happiness! Shall we not seek to awaken such? Shall we not give diligence to secure our own salvation?</body></html>
