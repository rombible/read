It is a destruction that shall break him up. <span class="accented">Without remedy</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">v'eyn mar'pe</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and there is no remedy.</span> There shall be, as Fleischer, as it were, no means of recovery for his shattered members.

The idea seems to be taken from the shattered fragments of a potter's vessel, which it is impossible to reunite. So in the case of the man whose life has been one of fraud, deceit, and malice, there is for him no hope of any recovery. The language may seem exaggerated, but the picture is painted with this high colouring to exhibit a strong deterrent to such a line of conduct, and further, it may be remarked that, in the present day, only the most confiding would again put trust in a man who has wilfully and maliciously deceived them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>). The second hemistich of this verse occurs again <span class="accented">verbatim</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-19 If the slothful are to be condemned, who do nothing, much more those that do all the ill they can. Observe how such a man is described. He says and does every thing artfully, and with design. His ruin shall come without warning, and without relief. Here is a list of things hateful to God. Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God, which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which God hates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others. Let us shun all such practices, and watch and pray against them; and avoid, with marked disapproval, all who are guilty of them, whatever may be their rank.</body></html>
