The same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a> is rendered "thoughts of iniquity." (On <span class="accented">deviseth</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">khoresh</span>, see ver. 14 and ch. 3:29.) The thought is a repetition of ver. 14<span class="accented">a</span>. There are evil thoughts in all men's hearts; but the devising, fabricating of them, and thus making the heart into a devil's workshop, is the mark of utter depravity and wickedness, and is abhorrent to God. The devices of the heart, though planned in secret, are clear to him "to whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are bid." The peculiar position which the heart occupies in the enumeration is to be accounted for on the ground that it is the fountain, not only of those vices which have been already mentioned, but of those which follow. The fifth thing is <span class="cmt_word">feet that be swift in running to mischief.</span> Again we are reminded of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, "Their feet run to evil." "Mischief" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ra</span>) is a re-echo of ver. 14 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-16.htm">Proverbs 1:16</a>. "To run to mischief" is to carry out with alacrity and without delay what has already been devised in the heart. It implies more than falling or sliding into sin, which is common to all. It denotes, Cornelius a Lapide remarks, "inexplebilem sceleris aviditatem, et destinatum studium." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-19 If the slothful are to be condemned, who do nothing, much more those that do all the ill they can. Observe how such a man is described. He says and does every thing artfully, and with design. His ruin shall come without warning, and without relief. Here is a list of things hateful to God. Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God, which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which God hates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others. Let us shun all such practices, and watch and pray against them; and avoid, with marked disapproval, all who are guilty of them, whatever may be their rank.</body></html>
