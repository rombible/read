It seems clear that "a wound" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">negav</span>, "a stroke" or "blow"), used here in the singular, collectively refers to the corporal punishment, which the outraged husband will inflict upon the adulterer (Delitzsch, Zockler. Lapide). (For the word, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>; 21:5.) It may also have reference to the punishment inflicted by the Law. In the LXX. the idea is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pains," and so gives colour to Lapide's explanation of "afflictions of every kind" The Vulgate gives a moral turn to the meaning, and coordinates the word with "dishonour:" <span class="accented">Turpitudinem et ignominiam congregat sibi</span>, "<span class="accented">Dishonour</span> is the ignominious treatment he will receive on all hands." The second part of the verse states that a brand of disgrace will be attached to his name which will be perpetual, not confined to this life only, but extending beyond it, so that men will never recall it but with this stigma (Patrick, Mercerus). On <span class="accented">shall be ... wiped away</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">timmakeh</span>, the niph. future of <span class="accented">makhah</span>, "to wipe off, or away," and in hiph. "to be blotted out," equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">delere</span>), see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-17.htm">Judges 21:17</a>. The LXX. renders <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and adds, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "forever." The statements of the verse are illustrated by Horace, 'Satires,' lib. 1:2, 37, who describes the dangers and mishaps which befall the adulterer and fornicator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Hic se praecipitem tecto dedit; ille flagellis<br />Ad mortem caesus: fugiens hic decidit acrem<br />Praedonum in turbam: dedit hic pro corpore nnmmos."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:20-35 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions. Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.</body></html>
