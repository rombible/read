The man who steals from hunger has a motive for so doing, but the adulterer has no such excuse for his crime, which is an unwarrantable invasion of his neighbour's rights. Because there are honest ways for satisfying his desires, he therefore "lacketh understanding." <span class="accented">Committeth adultery with a woman</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">noeph ishshah</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui adulter est</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an adulterer. The Hebrew <span class="accented">naaph</span>, "to commit adultery," is here followed by an accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>. <span class="accented">Lacketh understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">khasar-lev</span>; <span class="accented">deficit corde</span>. The verb <span class="accented">khaser</span> is "to be devoid of anything," "to lack." The expression, which occurs again in ch. Proverbs 7:7 aud Proverbs 9:4, refers to the brutish and stupid condition to which lust has reduced him. Lust has displaced right reason. He is <span class="accented">expers judicii</span> (Syriac), devoid of judgment, without intelligence, senseless and stupid. In modern phraseology, he has taken leave of his senses. Both the LXX. and Vulgate have combined the two branches of this verse, the former rendering, "But the adulterer, on account of want of intelligence, compasses the loss of his life," and the latter, "But the adulterer, on account of want of intelligence, loses his life." <span class="cmt_word">He that doeth it destroyeth his own soul;</span> or literally, <span class="accented">whoso will destroy his life he will do this, i.e.</span> adultery. So Ariae Montani, Munsterus, Chaldee Targum. The man who commits adultery is a self-murderer. The phrase, <span class="accented">mashkith naph'sho, corrumpens animam suam</span>, may be resolved into the concrete "a self-destroyer," as Delitzsch. The following verses seem to indicate that it is the temporal life which is referred to in <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, but the meaning of the term may be extended to embrace not only physical loss of life, but also moral and spiritual loss. By the Levitical Law adultery was punished by death: "The man that committeth adultery with another man's wife ... the adulterer and adulteress shall surely be put to death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-4.htm">John 8:4, 5</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:20-35 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions. Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.</body></html>
