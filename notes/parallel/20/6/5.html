The variation in all the ancient versions, with the exception of the Vulgate and Venetian, which read "from the snare," suggests that the original text was <span class="accented">mippath</span> instead of <span class="accented">miyyad.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">yad</span>, "hand," may, however, be used by metonymy for a toil or gin; but this is improbable, as no example of this kind can be found. With regard to the addition, "of the hunter," though this does not occur in the original, the parallelism would seem to clearly require it, and Bottcher maintains, but upon insufficient evidence, and against the reading of all manuscripts, which omit it, that the word <span class="accented">tsayyad</span>, equivalent to "of the hunter," formed part of the original text, but has fallen out. The plain reading, "from the hand," may, however, be used absolutely, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>, "Because thou hast let go out of thy hand (miyyad)," in which case the hand will not be that of the hunter, but that of the person for whom the one is surety. <span class="cmt_word">Roe</span>. There is a paronomasia in <span class="accented">ts'vi</span>, equivalent to "roe," and <span class="accented">tsiphor</span>, equivalent to "bird," of the original, which is lost in the Authorized Version. The <span class="accented">ts'vi</span> is the "roe" or "gazelle," so named from the beauty of its form (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-7.htm">Song of Solomon 2:7-9, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-5.htm">Song of Solomon 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-14.htm">Song of Solomon 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-3.htm">1 Kings 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>). <span class="accented">Tsippor</span> is a generic word, and represents any small bird. It is derived from the twittering or chirping noise which the bird makes, the root being <span class="accented">tsaphar</span>, "to chirp, or twitter." As to its identification with the sparrow, <span class="accented">Passer montanus</span>, or the blue thrush, <span class="accented">Petrocossyphus cyanens</span> (see 'Bible Animals,' Rev. J.G. Wood, p. 405, edit. 1876). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 If we live as directed by the word of God, we shall find it profitable even in this present world. We are stewards of our worldly substance, and have to answer to the Lord for our disposal of it; to waste it in rash schemes, or such plans as may entangle us in difficulties and temptations, is wrong. A man ought never to be surety for more than he is able and willing to pay, and can afford to pay, without wronging his family; he ought to look upon every sum he is engaged for, as his own debt. If we must take all this care to get our debts to men forgiven, much more to obtain forgiveness with God. Humble thyself to him, make sure of Christ as thy Friend, to plead for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned, and that thou mayest be kept from going down to the pit.</body></html>
