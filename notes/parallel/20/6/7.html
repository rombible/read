The three terms used here, <span class="accented">katsa, shoter, moshel</span>, all refer to government, and correspond respectively with the modern, Arabic terms, <span class="accented">kadi, wall</span>, and <span class="accented">emir</span> (Zockler). The first refers to the judicial office, and should rather be rendered "judge," the root <span class="accented">katsah</span> being "to decide" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-6.htm">Isaiah 3:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9</a>). The word, however, is used of a military commander in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6-11</a>, and in this sense it is understood by the Vulgate, which has <span class="accented">dux. Shoter</span>, rendered "overseer," is literally "a scribe," and appears as the general designation for any official In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6, 19</a> the <span class="accented">shoter</span> is the person employed by the Egyptian taskmasters to urge on the Israelites in their forced labour; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> the <span class="accented">shoter</span> is one of the seventy elders; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a> he is a municipal magistrate. The meaning assigned to the word in the Authorized Version seems to be the correct one. The ant has no overseer; there is none to regulate or see that the work is done. Each ant apparently works independently of the rest, though guided by a common instinct to add to the common store. In <span class="accented">moshel</span> we have the highest title of dignity and power, the word signifying a lord, prince, or ruler, from <span class="accented">mashal</span>, "to rule." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Diligence in business is every man's wisdom and duty; not so much that he may attain worldly wealth, as that he may not be a burden to others, or a scandal to the church. The ants are more diligent than slothful men. We may learn wisdom from the meanest insects, and be shamed by them. Habits of indolence and indulgence grow upon people. Thus life runs to waste; and poverty, though at first at a distance, gradually draws near, like a traveller; and when it arrives, is like an armed man, too strong to be resisted. All this may be applied to the concerns of our souls. How many love their sleep of sin, and their dreams of worldly happiness! Shall we not seek to awaken such? Shall we not give diligence to secure our own salvation?</body></html>
