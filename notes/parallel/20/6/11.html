Poverty will advance upon the sluggard with the unerring precision and swiftness with which a traveller tends towards the end of his journey, or, as Michaelis puts it, "quasi viator qui impigre pergit ac proprius venit donec propositum itineris scopum contingat" (Michaelis, 'Notre Uberiores'). Muffet, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, keeping to the figure, however, explains differently, "Poverty shall overtake thee, as a swift traveller does one who walks slowly." The Authorized Version, "as one that travelleth," correctly represents the original <span class="accented">kim'hallek.</span> There is no ground whatever, from the use of the verb, for rendering the piel participle <span class="accented">m'hallek</span> as "a robber." The verb <span class="accented">halak</span> invariably means "to go, or walk," and the piel or intensive form of the verb means "to walk vigorously, or quickly." The participle can only mean this in the two other passages where it occurs - <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:14</a>. The substantive <span class="accented">helek</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-4.htm">2 Samuel 12:4</a> also signifies "a traveller." So the Vulgate here, <span class="accented">quasi viator.</span> The other view, it is stated, is required by the parallel expression in the second hemistich, "as an armed man," and receives some support from the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "as an evil traveller," which may mean either a traveller bringing evil news, or one who wanders about with an evil intention and purpose, in the sense of the Latin <span class="accented">grassator</span>, "a highwayman." In this case the meaning would be that poverty shall come upon the sluggard as he is indulging in his sloth, and leave him destitute as if stripped by a robber. But the destitution of the sluggard wilt not only be certain and swift, it will be also irresistible. His want shall come upon him as <span class="accented">an armed man</span> (<span class="accented">k'ish magen</span>); literally, as <span class="accented">a man of a shield</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">quasi vir armatus</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> like one fully equipped, and who attacks his foe with such onset and force that against him resistance is useless. As the unarmed, unprepared man succumbs to such an opponent, so shall the sluggard fall before want. The expressions," <span class="accented">thy</span> poverty" and "<span class="accented">thy</span> want," represent the destitution of the sluggard as flowing directly from his own habit of self-indulgence. It is his in a special manner) and he, not others, is alone responsible for it. Compare, beside the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-33.htm">Proverbs 24:33</a>, the similar teaching in ch. 10:4; 13:4; 20:4. The Vulgate, LXX., and Arabic Versions at the close of this verse add, "But if thou art diligent, the harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee;" the LXX. making a further addition, "as a bad runner (<span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>)." It is observable, in comparing this section with the preceding, that the teacher pursues the subject of the sluggard to its close, while he leaves the end of the surety undetermined. The explanation may be in the difference in character of the two. The surety may escape the consequences of his act, but there is no such relief for the sluggard. His slothfulness becomes a habit, which increases the more it is indulged in, and leads to consequences which are as irremediable as they are inevitable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Diligence in business is every man's wisdom and duty; not so much that he may attain worldly wealth, as that he may not be a burden to others, or a scandal to the church. The ants are more diligent than slothful men. We may learn wisdom from the meanest insects, and be shamed by them. Habits of indolence and indulgence grow upon people. Thus life runs to waste; and poverty, though at first at a distance, gradually draws near, like a traveller; and when it arrives, is like an armed man, too strong to be resisted. All this may be applied to the concerns of our souls. How many love their sleep of sin, and their dreams of worldly happiness! Shall we not seek to awaken such? Shall we not give diligence to secure our own salvation?</body></html>
