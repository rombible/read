These are supposed to be offered by the adulterer to the enraged husband, who, however, will never rest till he effects the utter ruin of his injurer. The literal rendering of the first hemistich is, "He will not accept the face of any ransom." The phrase <span class="accented">nasa phanim</span>, is equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and signifies "to give a favourable reception to the outward expression of any one." The figure is taken from lifting up the face of a suppliant, the radical meaning of the verb <span class="accented">nasa</span> being "to take up," "to lift up." The <span class="accented">ransom</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">kopher</span> (the word usually applied to designate the price of redemption, mulct, or line demanded for expiation of a crime; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31, 32</a>); here the bribe offered by the adulterer to be let off will be altogether rejected, however alluring, the word <span class="accented">p'ney</span>, "face," carrying with it the idea of something recommendatory. For the expression, <span class="accented">nasa phanim</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-10.htm">Job 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>. The LXX. rendering is, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "He will not commute for any redemption his enmity." <span class="accented">Neither will he rest content</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and he will not be willing</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">v'lo-yoveh</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>, "nor may it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his enmity, be dissolved or weakened." (On the verb <span class="accented">avah</span>, "to consent to," or "to be willing," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>.) Many gifts, each increasing in value, may be offered, but he will not be willing to forego his right of revenge. <span class="accented">Though thou givest many gifts.</span> It is noticeable that the address, which has been adapted to the third person, here becomes personal, and so takes up the form originally employed in vers. 20-25. A hypothetical case has been imagined in vers. 26-35, but still with the thought underlying it that it applies to the person addressed. "Though <span class="accented">thou</span> givest many gifts," or more literally, "though thou multipliest the gift," brings the matter homo to the young man. <span class="accented">Gifts</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">shokad</span>, "the gift," is the word usually employed to designate the bribe offered to corrupt a judge (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-25.htm">Deuteronomy 27:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>). Here it refers to the money offered to free from punishment. The Vulgate gives the idea that these gifts or bribes are offered by a third party on behalf of the adulterer: <span class="accented">Nec acquiescet cujusquam precibus, nec suscipiet pro redemptione dona plurima.</span> On these two last verses Lange remarks, "Just as little as the adulterer, taken in his adultery, is left unpunished by the injured husband, so little, yea, even less, wilt the spiritual adulterer remain unpunished of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:20-35 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions. Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.</body></html>
