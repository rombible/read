The surety is to take immediate steps to be set free. The urgency of the advice is to be explained by the serious consequences which would follow in the event of the debtor not satisfying the creditor in due time. The surety became liable to the penalties inflicted by the Hebrew law of debt. His property could be distrained. His bed and his garment could be taken from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-27.htm">Proverbs 22:27</a> and Proverbs 20:16), and he was liable as well as his family to be reduced to the condition of servitude. So we find the son of Sirach saying, "Suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations" (Ecclus. 29:18; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3-5</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>). Compare the dictum of Thales, the Greek philosopher, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "Give surety, and ruin is near;" and that of Chilo (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 6:32), "Sponsioni non deest jactura" - "Loss is not wanting to a surety." The same idea is conveyed in the modern German proverb, "Burgen soll man wurgen" - "Worry a surety" <span class="cmt_word">Do this now;</span> or, <span class="accented">therefore.</span> The particle <span class="accented">epho</span> is intensive, and emphasizes the command, and in this sense is of frequent occurrence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-32.htm">Genesis 27:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-10.htm">2 Kings 10:10</a>, etc.). It appears to be equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">quod dico.</span> So the Vulgate, "Do therefore what I say;" similarly the LXX. renders, "Do, my son, what I bid thee (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." It carries with it the sense of instant and prompt action. <span class="cmt_word">And deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> set thyself free when thou findest thou art actually at the mercy of thy friend for whom thou hast become surety. The <span class="accented">ki</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is not hypothetical, but actual; it is not "if" you are, but "when" or because you actually are in his power. The Vulgate and LXX. render <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> respectively by <span class="accented">quia</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Go, humble thyself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> present thyself as a suppliant, prostrate thyself, offer thyself to be trodden upon (Michaelis), or humble thyself like to the threshold which is trampled and trode upon (Rashi). or humble thyself under the soles of his feet (Aben Ezra). The expression implies the spirit of entire submission, in which the surety is to approach his friend in order to be released from his responsibility. The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">hith'rappes</span> has, however, been rendered differently. Radically <span class="accented">raphas</span> signifies "to tread or trample with the feet," and this has been taken to express haste, or the bestirring of one's self. So the Vulgate reads <span class="accented">festina</span>, "hasten;" and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be not remiss." But the hithp, clearly determines in favour of the reflexive rendering; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>, "Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver" - the only other passage where <span class="accented">raphas</span> occurs. <span class="cmt_word">And make sure thy friend</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">r'hav reeyka</span>); rather, <span class="accented">importune thy friend</span>, be urgent with him, press upon him to fulfil his engagement. The verb <span class="accented">rahav</span> is properly "to be fierce," "to rage," and hence with the accusative, as here, "to assail with impetuosity." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a> it is used with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>), and signifies to act fiercely against any one. The meaning of the passage is that if abject submission or persuasion does not avail, then sterner measures are to be resorted to to gain the desired end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 If we live as directed by the word of God, we shall find it profitable even in this present world. We are stewards of our worldly substance, and have to answer to the Lord for our disposal of it; to waste it in rash schemes, or such plans as may entangle us in difficulties and temptations, is wrong. A man ought never to be surety for more than he is able and willing to pay, and can afford to pay, without wronging his family; he ought to look upon every sum he is engaged for, as his own debt. If we must take all this care to get our debts to men forgiven, much more to obtain forgiveness with God. Humble thyself to him, make sure of Christ as thy Friend, to plead for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned, and that thou mayest be kept from going down to the pit.</body></html>
