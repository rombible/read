Though only specifying three conditions, they refer to the whole conduct of life, and hence the verse promises direction, guardianship, and converse of wisdom, which will undoubtedly attend life where the precepts of parents are lovingly treasured and obediently observed. The Authorized Version conveys the impression that it is "the keeping" of the parents' precepts, etc., which is to bear such results; but it is better to understand "it" as signifying the whole teaching or doctrine of wisdom, as Delitzsch. Wisdom becomes personified in the representation, and identified with her teaching. <span class="cmt_word">It shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">lead thee.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">nakhah</span>, "to lead," in the sense of "to direct," like the Latin <span class="accented">dirigere</span> (Delitzsch), and as it is used in Exodus and Numbers, <span class="accented">passim.</span> In the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>, etc.) it is employed of God as governing men. Hence, in the affairs of life, Wisdom will so guide and control us that we shall act uprightly. There is the further notion imported into the word of preservation from evil (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a>, "Thou shalt walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble"). <span class="cmt_word">When thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">sleepest;</span> or, <span class="accented">when thou liest down</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, where the same verb occurs. <span class="cmt_word">It shall keep thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> watch over, keep safe, or preserve; as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">custodire</span>, and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. We have had the same verb, <span class="accented">shamar</span>, before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>. Wisdom will be as it were a guardian angel in our hours of repose. <span class="cmt_word">When thou awakest</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">hakitsotha</span>, the hiph. perfect of <span class="accented">kutz.</span> This word only occurs here. The hiph. form, <span class="accented">hekitz</span>, is intransitive, "to be aroused" (cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>It shall talk with thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">she.</span> Bertheau renders, "She will make thee thoughtful;" and Dathe, "Let them be thy meditation;" but the accusative suffix designates the person who is the object of the action of the verb, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a> (Zockler) and as Delitzseh remarks, the personification requires something more than a mere meditation with one's self on the precepts of Wisdom. Wisdom herself shall hold converse with thee (cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), she shall suggest thoughts how thou art to behave thyself. The meaning of the verb, "to meditate," "to think deeply," however, need not be lost sight of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:20-35 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions. Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.</body></html>
