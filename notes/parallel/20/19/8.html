"Wisdom" is, in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">leb.</span> "heart;" it is a matter, not of intellect only. but of will and affections (see on Proverbs 15:32). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "loveth himself." The contrary, "hateth his own soul," occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-24.htm">Proverbs 29:24</a>. By striving to obtain wisdom a man shows that he has regard for the welfare of his soul and body. Hence St. Thomas Aquinas ('Sum. Theol.,' 1:2, qu. 25, art. 7, quoted by Corn. a Lapide) takes occasion to demonstrate that only good men are really lovers of themselves, while evil men are practically self-haters, proving his position by a reference to Arislotle's numeration of the characteristics of friendship, which the former exhibit, and none of which the latter can possess ('Eth. Nic.,' 9:4). <span class="cmt_word">He that keepeth understanding shall find</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>). A man must not only strive hard and use all available means to get wisdom and prudence, he must guard them like a precious treasure, not lose them for want of care or let them lie useless; and then he will find that they bring with themselves innumerable benefits. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:3. Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the appointments of God. 4. Here we may see how strong is men's love of money. 5. Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness. 6. We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 7. Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 8. Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 9. Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 10. A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy. It is very unseemly for one who is a servant to sin, to oppress God's free-men.</body></html>
