At first sight it looks as if some verse, to which this one was appended, had fallen out; but there is no trace in the versions of any such loss. We have had a verse beginning in the same manner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>), and here it seems to emphasize what follows - folly is bad, so is ignorance, when the soul lacks knowledge, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when a man does not know what to do, how to act in the circumstances of his life, has in fact no practical wisdom. Other things "not good" are named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>. And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth; misseth his way. Delitzsch confines the meaning of this hemistich to the undisciplined pursuit of knowledge: "He who hasteneth with the legs after it goeth astray," because he is neither intellectually nor morally clear as to his path or object. But the gnome is better taken in a more general sense. The ignorant man, who acts hastily without due deliberation, is sure to make grave mistakes, and to come to misfortune. Haste is opposed to knowledge, because the latter involves prudence and circumspection, while the former blunders on hurriedly, not seeing whither actions lead. We all have occasion to note the proverbs, <span class="accented">Festina lente</span>; "More haste, less speed." The history of Fabius, who, as Ennius said, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem,"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>shows the value of deliberation and caution. The Greeks recognized this - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Rash haste is cause of evil unto many."</span> Erasmus, in his 'Adagia,' has a long article commenting on <span class="accented">Festinatio praepropera.</span> The Arabs say," Patience is the key of joy, but haste is the key of sorrow." God is patient because he is eternal. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1 A poor man who fears God, is more honourable and happy, than a man without wisdom and grace, however rich or advanced in rank. 2. What good can the soul do, if without knowledge? And he sins who will not take time to ponder the path of his feet.</body></html>
