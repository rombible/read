It comes in awkwardly here, interrupting the connection which subsists between vers. 4 and 6. Its right place is doubtless where it occurs below. The Law not only strictly forbade false witness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>), but it enacted severe penalties against offenders in this particular (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16</a>, etc.); the <span class="accented">lex</span> <span class="accented">talionis</span> was to be enforced against them, they were to receive no pity: "Life shall be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot." <span class="cmt_word">He that</span> <span class="cmt_word">speaketh lies shall not escape.</span> The Septuagint confines the notion of this clause to false accusers, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "He who maketh an unjust charge shall not escape," which renders the two clauses almost synonymous. We make a distinction between the members by seeing in the former a denunciation against a false witness in a suit, and in the second a more sweeping menace against any one, whether accuser, slanderer, sycophant, who by lying injures a neighbour. The History of Susanna is brought forward in confirmation of the well deserved fate of false accusers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"A slander is an outrage on man's life."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:3. Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the appointments of God. 4. Here we may see how strong is men's love of money. 5. Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness. 6. We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 7. Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 8. Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 9. Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 10. A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy. It is very unseemly for one who is a servant to sin, to oppress God's free-men.</body></html>
