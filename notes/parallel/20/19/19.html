But there is no connecting particle in the Hebrew, and the statement seems to be of a general nature. <span class="cmt_word">A man of great wrath;</span> literally, <span class="accented">rough in anger</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">impatiens</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>. Such a one <span class="cmt_word">shall suffer punishment;</span> shall bear the penalty which his want of self-control brings upon him. <span class="cmt_word">For if thou deliver him, yet must thou do it again.</span> You cannot save him from the consequences of his intemperance; you may do so once and again, but while his disposition is unchanged, all your efforts will be useless, and the help which you have given him will only make him think that he may continue to indulge his anger with impunity, or, it may be, he will vent his impatience on his deliverer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> Anger, says an adage, "is like a ruin, which breaks itself upon what it falls." Septuagint, "If he destroy (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), he shall add even his life;" if by his anger he inflict loss or damage on his neighbour, he shall pay for it in his own person; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et cum rapuerit, aliud apponet.</span> Another interpretation of the passage, but not so suitable, is this: "If thou seek to save the sufferer (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> by soothing the angry man), thou wilt only the more excite him (the wrathful): therefore do not intermeddle in quarrels of other persons." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:19. The spared and spoiled child is likely to become a man of great wrath. 20. Those that would be wise in their latter end, must be taught and ruled when young. 21. What should we desire, but that all our purposes may agree with God's holy will? 22. It is far better to have a heart to do good, and want ability for it, than to have ability for it, and want a heart to it. 23. Those that live in the fear of God, shall get safety, satisfaction, and true and complete happiness. 24. Indolence, when indulged, so grows upon people, that they have no heart to do the most needful things for themselves. 25. A gentle rebuke goes farthest with a man of understanding. 26. The young man who wastes his father's substance, or makes his aged mother destitute, is hateful, and will come to disgrace.</body></html>
