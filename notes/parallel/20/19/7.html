The third line, corrected by the Septuagint, which has an addition here, runs into two clauses (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">All the brethren of the poor do hate him.</span> Even his own brothers, children of the same parents, hate and shun a poor man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Much more do his friends go far from him.</span> There should be no interrogation. We have the expression (<span class="accented">aph-ki</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>, etc. Euripides, 'Medea,' 561 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Each single friend far from the poor man flies."</span> Septuagint. "Every one who hateth a poor brother will be also far from friendship." Then follows an addition not found m the Hebrew, "Good thought draweth nigh to those who know it, and a prudent man will find it. He who doeth much evil brings malice to perfection (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); and he who rouses words to anger shall not be safe." <span class="cmt_word">He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him;</span> or, <span class="accented">they are gone.</span> He makes a pathetic appeal to his quondam friends, but they hearken not to him. But the sense is rather, "He pursueth after, craves for, words of kindness or promises of help, and there is naught, or he gets words only and no material aid." Wordsworth quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 38:5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,<br />Qua solatus es adlocutione?<br />Irascor tibi. Sic meos amores?"</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>, "He who pursues words only shall have naught." The Hebrew is literally, "Seeking words, they are not" This is according to the Khetib; the Keri, instead of the negation <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, which makes the clause signify, "He who pursues words, they are to him;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gets words and nothing else. Delitzsch and others, supplying the lost member from the Septuagint, read the third line thus: "He that hath many friends, or the friend of every one, is requited with evil; and he that seeketh (fair) speeches shall not be delivered." Cheyne also makes a distich of this line, taking the Septuagint as representing the original reading, "He that does much evil perfects mischief: He that provokes with words shall not escape." That something has fallen out of the Hebrew text is evident; it seems that there are no examples of tristichs in this part of our book, though they are not unknown in the first and third divisions. The Vulgate surmounts the difficulty by connecting this third line with the following verse, which thus is made to form the antithesis, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>; <span class="accented">Qui autem possessor est mentis, diligit animam suam, et custos prudentiae inveniet bona."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:3. Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the appointments of God. 4. Here we may see how strong is men's love of money. 5. Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness. 6. We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 7. Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 8. Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 9. Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 10. A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy. It is very unseemly for one who is a servant to sin, to oppress God's free-men.</body></html>
