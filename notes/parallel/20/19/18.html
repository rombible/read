The same expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-18.htm">Job 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-16.htm">Jeremiah 31:16</a>. "For so he shall be well hoped of" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), Septuagint (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And let not thy soul spare for his crying.</span> "It is better," says a German apothegm, "that the child weep than the father." But the rendering of the Authorized Version is not well established, and this second clause is intended to inculcate moderation in punishment. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ad interfectionem autem ejus ne ponas animam tuam</span>; Revised Version. <span class="accented">Set not thine heart on his destruction.</span> Chastise him duty and sufficiently, but not so heavily as to occasion his death, which a father had no right to do. The Law enjoined the parents who had an incorrigibly bad son to bring him before the judge or the eiders, who alone had the power of life and death, and might in certain cases order the offender to be stoned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>, etc.). Christianity recommended moderation in punishment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-21.htm">Colossians 3:21</a>). Septuagint, "Be not excited in the mind to despiteful treatment (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>);" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be not led away by passion to unseemly acts or words, but reprove with gentleness, while you are firm and uncompromising in denouncing evil. This is much the same advice as that given by the apostle in the passages just cited. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:14. A discreet and virtuous wife is more valuable than house and riches. 15. A sluggish, slothful disposition makes men poor; it brings them to want. And this applies both to the present life and that which is to come. 16. If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us from every thing really hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner. 17. God has chosen the poor of this world, to be rich in faith, and heirs of his kingdom. 18. When parents keep under foolish tenderness, they do their best to render children a comfort to them, and happy in themselves.</body></html>
