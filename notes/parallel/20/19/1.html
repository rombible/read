That a rich man is here intended appears likely from the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-6.htm" title="Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.">Proverbs 28:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Better is the poor that walkth in his integrity.</span> The word for "poor" is, here and in vers. 7, 22, <span class="accented">rash</span>, which signifies "poor" in opposition to "rich." In the present reading of the second clause, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool, there seems to be a failure in antithesis, unless we can understand the fool as a rich fool. This, the repetition of the maxim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-6.htm">Proverbs 28:6</a> ("Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich"), would lead one to admit. The Vulgate accordingly has, <span class="accented">Quam dives torquem labia sua, et insipiens</span>, "Than a rich man who is of perverse lips and a fool." With this the Syriac partly agrees. So that, if we take this reading, the moralist says that the poor man who lives a guileless, innocent life, content with his lot, and using no wrong means to improve his fortunes, is happier and better than the rich man who is hypocritical in his words and deceives others, and has won his wealth by such means, thus proving himself to be a fool, a morally bad man. But if we content ourselves with the Hebrew text, we must find the antithesis in the simple, pious, poor man, contrasted with the arrogant rich man, who sneers at his poor neighbour as an inferior creature. The writer would seem to insinuate that there is a natural connection between poverty and integrity of life on the one hand, and wealth and folly on the other. He would assent to the sweeping assertion, <span class="accented">Omnis dives ant iniquus aut iniqui heres</span>, "Every rich man is either a rascal or a rascal's heir." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1 A poor man who fears God, is more honourable and happy, than a man without wisdom and grace, however rich or advanced in rank. 2. What good can the soul do, if without knowledge? And he sins who will not take time to ponder the path of his feet.</body></html>
