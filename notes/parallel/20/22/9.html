The "good of eye" is the kindly looking, the benevolent man, in contrast to him of the evil eye, the envious, the unfriendly and stingy man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>). St. Jerome renders, <span class="accented">Qui pronus est ad misericordiam.</span> Such a one is blessed by God in this world and the next, in time and in eternity, according to the sentiment of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>. Thus in the temporal sense (Ecclus. 34 (31):23). "Him that is liberal in food lips shall bless, and the testimony of his liberality will be believed." Septuagint, "He that hath pity upon the poor shall himself be continually sustained (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." The reason is added, For he giveth of his brans to the poor. The blessing is the consequence of his charity and liberality. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>, "He that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Vulgate and Septuagint add a distich not in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Victoriam et honorem acquiret qui dat munera</span>; <span class="accented">animam autem aufert accipientium</span>; <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, "Victory and honour he obtaineth who giveth gifts; but he takes away the life of the possessors." The first hemistich appears to be a variant of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a><span class="accented">b</span>, the second to be derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a><span class="accented">b</span>. The second portion of the Latin addition may mean that the liberal man wins and carries away with him the souls of the recipients of his bounty. But this, though Ewald would fain have it so, cannot be the signification of the corresponding Greek, which seems to mean that the man who is so liberal in distributing gifts obtains the power to do so by oppressing and wronging others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1 We should be more careful to do that by which we may get and keep a good name, than to raise or add unto a great estate. 2. Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.</body></html>
