The Khetib has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "the day before yesterday, formerly;" but the word occurs nowhere alone, and, as Nowack says, can hardly have been the original reading. However, Ewald, Bertheau, and others, adopting it, suppose that the author refers to some earlier work. Cheyne cites Bickell's rendering, "Now, years before now, have I written unto thee long before with counsels and knowledge," and considers the words to mean either that the compiler took a long time over his work, or that this was not the first occasion of his writing. One does not see why stress should be here laid on former instruction, unless, perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, in contrast to "this day" of the previous verse. The LXX. renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> thus, "And do thou record them for thyself triply for counsel and knowledge upon the table of thine heart." St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ecce descripsi eam tibi tripliciter, in cogitationibus et scientiis.</span> Other versions have also given a numerical explanation to the term. In it is seen an allusion to the three supposed works of Solomon - Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles - which is absurd; others refer it to the threefold division of the Testament - Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa; others, to three classes of youths for whom the admonitious were intended; others, again, think it equivalent to "oftentimes," or "in many forms." But the reading is as doubtful as the explanations of it are unsatisfactory. The genuine word is doubtless preserved in the Keri, which gives <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shalishim</span>), properly a military term, applied to chariot fighters and men of rank in the army. The LXX. translates the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>), which is equivalent to "chieftain." Hence the Hebrew term, understood in the neuter gender, is transferred to the chief among proverbs - "choice proverbs," as Delitzsch calls them. The Venetian, by a happy turn, gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. Thus we come back to the rendering of the Authorized Version as meet correct and intelligible. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:17-21. To these words, to this knowledge, the ear must be bowed down, and the heart applied by faith and love. To live a life of delight in God and dependence on him, is the foundation of all practical religion. The way to know the certainty of the word of truth, is to make conscience of our duty. 22,23. He that robs and oppresses the poor, does so at his peril. And if men will not appear for them, God will. 24,25. Our corrupt hearts have so much tinder in them, that it is dangerous to have to do with those that throw about the sparks of their passion.</body></html>
