Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">arma et gladiii</span> but the Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. It is a question whether the thorns are what the perverse prepare for others, or what they themselves suffer. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a> the hedge of thorns represented the difficulties in the sluggard's path; but here, viewed in connection with the following hemistich, the thorns and snares refer to the hindrances proceeding from the froward, which injuriously affect others; "thorns" being a figure of the pains and troubles, "snares" of the unexpected dangers and impediments which evil men cause as they go on their crooked way. The word for "thorns" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>. The plant is supposed to be the <span class="accented">Rhamnus paliurus</span>, but it has not been accurately identified. <span class="cmt_word">He that doth keep his soul shall be far from them</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-17.htm">Proverbs 16:17</a>). The man who has regard to his life and morals will go far, will keep wholly aloof, from those perils and traps into which the perverse try to entice them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1 We should be more careful to do that by which we may get and keep a good name, than to raise or add unto a great estate. 2. Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.</body></html>
