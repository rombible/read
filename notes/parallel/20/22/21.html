The scholar is to be instructed not for his own profit alone, but in order that he may be able to teach others also. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth.</span> The object intended is to teach the disciple the fixed rule (<span class="accented">firmitatem</span>, Vulgate) by which truthful words are guided (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>). Septuagint, "I therefore teach thee a true word and knowledge good to learn." <span class="cmt_word">That thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee.</span> This implies that the pupil will be enabled to teach others who apply to him for instruction; "will be ready." as St. Peter says, "always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>). But the last expression is better translated, "them that send thee;" <span class="accented">illis qui miserunt te</span>, Vulgate (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>); and we must conceive of these as being parents or tutors who send a youth to a school or wise man to be educated. The moralist expresses his desire that the disciple will carry home such wholesome, truthful doctrines as will prove that the pains expended upon him have not been useless. Septuagint, "That thou mayest answer words of truth to those who put questions to thee (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)" The Syriac adds, "That I may make known unto thee counsel and wisdom." Bickell's version (quoted by Cheyne) is, "That thou mayest know the rightness of these words, that thou mayest answer in true words to them that ask thee." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:17-21. To these words, to this knowledge, the ear must be bowed down, and the heart applied by faith and love. To live a life of delight in God and dependence on him, is the foundation of all practical religion. The way to know the certainty of the word of truth, is to make conscience of our duty. 22,23. He that robs and oppresses the poor, does so at his peril. And if men will not appear for them, God will. 24,25. Our corrupt hearts have so much tinder in them, that it is dangerous to have to do with those that throw about the sparks of their passion.</body></html>
