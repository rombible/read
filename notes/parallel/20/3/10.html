Few persons find it easy to realize that giving away will increase their store (Wardlaw). The teacher is warranted in bringing forward this promise by the language of Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-8</a>, whine, among other things, he promises that Jehovah will command a blessing upon the "storehouses" and industry of those who honour God. The principle is otherwise expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>, "The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth shall be also watered himself;" and it is exemplified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-3.htm">Haggai 1:3-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10-12</a>, and in the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-14.htm">Philippians 4:14-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-8</a>. <span class="accented">Thy barns</span>; <span class="accented">asameykha</span>, the only form in which <span class="accented">asam</span>, "a storehouse," "barn," or "granary," occurs. The Hebrew <span class="accented">asam</span> is the same as the Latin <span class="accented">horreum</span> (Vulgate) and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.). <span class="accented">With plenty</span> (<span class="accented">sava</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">saturitas</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fulness, abundance, plenty. The root <span class="accented">sava</span> is "to become satisfied," and that richly satisfied. This expression and the following, <span class="cmt_word">and thy presses shall burst out with new wine,</span> depict the greatest abundance. <span class="accented">Thy presses</span> (<span class="accented">y'kaveykhu</span>). The word here translated "presses" is, strictly speaking," vats" or "reservoirs," into which the must from the wine press flowed. The wine press consisted of two parts, the <span class="accented">gath</span> (equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">torcularium, torculum</span>, or <span class="accented">torcular</span>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>), into which the grapes were collected from the surrounding vineyard, and there trodden underfoot by several persons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>), whose movements were regulated by singing or shouting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>), as among the Greeks (see 'Athen.,' 5. p. 199, <span class="accented">a</span>; Anacreon, 'Od.,' 17:1, 52; cf. Theocritus, 7:25) and Egyptians (Wilkinson, 'Man. and Cust.,' vol. 2. pp. 152-157); and the <span class="accented">yekev</span>, used here, which was a trough of corresponding size, dug into the ground, or cut out of a rack, at a lower level, to receive the must. The <span class="accented">yekev</span> corresponded with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12.htm">Mark 12</a>:l, and the Latin <span class="accented">lacus</span> (Ovid, 'Fasti,' 5:888; Pliny, 'Epist.,' 9:20; 'Colum. de Rust.,' 12:18): Cajeterus, indeed, reads, <span class="accented">lacus torcularii.</span> The word <span class="accented">yekev</span> is, however, used for the wine press itself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-27.htm">2 Kings 6:27</a>. <span class="accented">Shall burst out</span> (<span class="accented">yiph'rotsu</span>); literally, <span class="accented">they shall extend themselves</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall overflow. <span class="accented">Parats</span>, "to break," is here used metaphorically in the sense of "to be redundant," "to overflow" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>). It is employed intransitively of a people spreading themselves abroad, or increasing, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-12.htm">Exodus 1:12</a>. <span class="accented">New wine</span> (<span class="accented">tirosh</span>); Vulgate, Arabic, and Syriac, <span class="accented">vino</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>; properly, as in the Authorized Version, "new wine;" Latin, <span class="accented">mustum</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-17.htm">Isaiah 36:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 There is not a greater enemy to the fear of the Lord in the heart, than self-conceit of our own wisdom. The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.</body></html>
