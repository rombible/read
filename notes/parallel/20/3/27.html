The discourse differs from the preceding in consisting of detached proverbs, and may be divided into two main sections - the first (vers. 27-30) enjoining benevolence, that love to one's neighbour which is the fulfilling of the Law; the second warning against emulating the oppressor and associating with him, because of the fate of the wicked (vers. 31-35). It is observable that all the maxims have a negative form, and thus present a striking contrast to the form adopted by our Lord in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>.), and to the admonitions at the close of St. Paul's Epistles. In one instance in particular (ver. 30), the teaching does not reach the high moral standard of the gospel (see Delitzsch and Lange). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due.</span> This precept indicates the general principle of beneficence, and not merely, as the words at first sight seem to imply, restitution (as Cajet.). We are to do good to those who are in need or deserving of it, whenever we have the means and opportunity. <span class="accented">From them to whom it is due</span> (<span class="accented">nib'alayv</span>); literally, <span class="accented">from its owner</span>, from <span class="accented">baal, dominus</span>, "lord" or owner of a thing. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-22.htm">Proverbs 16:22</a>, "Prudence is a fountain of life to its owner (<span class="accented">b'alayv</span>);" 1:19; 17:8; and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; - in all of which passages proprietorship in the thing or quality mentioned is expressed. The owners of good are those to whom good is due or belongs either by law or by morality, whether by desert or need. The latter qualification is the one emphasized in the LXX, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fc6;</span>, "Abstain not from doing good to the needy." So the Arabic <span class="accented">pauperi.</span> The Targum and Syriac put the precept in more general terms, "Cease not to do good," without indicating in particular anyone who is to be the recipient of the good. But the Jewish interpreters generally (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ben Ezra) understand it of the poor, <span class="accented">egentibus.</span> The Vulgate puts an entirely different interpretation on the passage: <span class="accented">Noli prohibere benefacere eum qui potest</span>; <span class="accented">si vales, et ipse benefac</span>, "Do not prohibit him who can from doing good; if you are able, do good also yourself." It thus implies that we are to put no impediment in the way of any one who is willing to do good to others, and enjoins the duty on ourselves also. <span class="accented">Good</span> (<span class="accented">tov</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">good"</span> under any form, any good deed or act of beneficence. The principle brought forward in this passage is that what we possess and is seemingly our own is in reality to be regarded as belonging to others. We are only stewards of our wealth. <span class="cmt_word">In the power of thine hand</span> (<span class="accented">lel yad'yka</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the power of thine hands.</span> For the dual, <span class="accented">yad'yka</span>, the Keri substitutes the singular, <span class="accented">yad'ka</span>, to harmonize it with the similar expression, <span class="accented">lel yadi</span>, "in the power of thy hand," which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-32.htm">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>. But there is no grammatical need for the emendation. Both the LXX. and Targum employ the singular, "thy hand." <span class="accented">Power</span> (<span class="accented">el</span>); here "strength" in the abstract. Usually it means "the strong," and is so used as an appellation of Jehovah. though, as Gesenius says, those little understand the phrase who would render <span class="accented">el</span> here "by God." The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to <span class="accented">el</span> indicates the condition. The meaning of the phrase is, "While it is practicable, and you have the opportunity and means of doing good, do it." Do not defer, but do good promptly. The passage receives a remarkable illustration in the language of St. Paul, "While we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-35 Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy his example; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness; to be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearing evils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.</body></html>
