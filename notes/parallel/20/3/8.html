The Targum Jonathan has <span class="accented">medicina</span>, "medicine," as the margin. The root <span class="accented">rapha</span> is properly "to sew together," and the secondary meaning, "to heal," is taken from the healing of a wound by sewing it up. Delitzsch, however, thinks <span class="accented">riph'uth</span> is not to be taken as a restoration from sickness, but as a raising up from enfeebled health, or a confirming of the strength which already exists. There shall be a continuance of health. Gesenius translates "refreshment." <span class="accented">To thy navel</span> (<span class="accented">l'shor'rekha</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">umbilico tuo</span>; so Targum Jonathan. <span class="accented">Shor</span> is "the navel," here used synecdochically for the whole body, just as "head" is put for the whole man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>), "mouth" for the whole person speaking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>), and "slow bellies" for depraved gluttons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>) (Gejerus, Umbreit). The idea is expressed in the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic by "to thy body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">corpori tuo</span>). The navel is here regarded as the centre of vital strength. For the word, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-2.htm">Song of Solomon 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>. This is the only place in the Proverbs where this word is found. Gesenius, however, takes <span class="accented">shor, or l'shor'rekha</span>, as standing col. lectively for the nerves, in which, he says, is the seat of strength, and translates accordingly, "Health (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> refreshment) shall it be to thy nerves." <span class="accented">Marrow</span> (<span class="accented">shik'kuy</span>); literally, <span class="accented">watering</span> or <span class="accented">moistening</span>, as in the margin; Vulgate, <span class="accented">irrigatio.</span> Moistening is imparted to the bones by the marrow, and thus they are strengthened: "His bones are moistened with marrow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-24.htm">Job 21:24</a>). Where there is an absence of marrow the drying up of the bones ensues, and hence their strength is impaired, and a general debility of the system sets in - they "wax old" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>). The effect of a broken spirit is thus described: "A broken spirit drieth up the bones" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). The physiological fact here brought forward is borne witness to by Cicero, 'In Tusc.:' "In visceribus atque medullis omne bonum condidisse naturam" (cf. Plato). The meaning of the passage is that, as health to the navel and marrow to the bones stand as representatives of physical strength, so the fear of the Lord, etc., is the spiritual strength of God's children. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 There is not a greater enemy to the fear of the Lord in the heart, than self-conceit of our own wisdom. The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.</body></html>
