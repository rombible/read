(<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm" title="So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David.

By some there is thought to be a distinction intended between the well-built "house" of the wicked and the slightly constructed cottage of the humble just man, no better than a shepherd's hut.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked.</span> From ver. 33 to the end of the discourse the contrast is continued between the condition of the wicked and the just, the scornful and the lowly, the wise and the fools. In the verse before us a further reason is given why the prosperity of the wicked is not enviable. The curse of Jehovah dwells in and rests upon his house. <span class="accented">The curse</span>; <span class="accented">m'erah</span>, from <span class="accented">arav</span>, "to curse." This word only occurs five times in the Old Testament once in Deuteronomy, twice in Proverbs (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-27.htm">Proverbs 28:27</a>), and twice in Malachi. The nature of the curse may be learned from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>, where it is the infliction of temporal misfortunes ending with the "cutting off" of the wicked (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-22.htm">Psalm 37:22</a>). It is a hovering evil, the source of constant misfortune. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. Cf. "the cursing" (<span class="accented">alah</span>) against thieves and swearers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">But he blesseth the habitation the just.</span> The contrast to the former, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2-6</a>. <span class="accented">He blesseth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> both temporarily and spiritually. Blessing does not exclude affliction, but "trials" are not "curses" (Wardlaw). Both the LXX. and the Vulgate render, "But the habitations of the just shall be blessed," the LXX. having read the pual future (<span class="accented">y'vorak</span>), "they shall be blessed," for the piel future (<span class="accented">y'varik</span>), "he shall bless," of the text. <span class="accented">The habitation</span>; <span class="accented">naveh</span>, from <span class="accented">navah</span>, "to sit down," "to dwell." A poetic and nomad (Fleischer) word usually understood of a small dwelling is <span class="accented">tugurium</span>, the shepherd's hut or cottage, "the sheepcote" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>. The LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and tho Vulgate <span class="accented">hubitaculam</span>, favour the suggestion of Gejerus, that a contrast is here made between the large house or palace (<span class="accented">bayith</span>) of the wicked and the small dwelling of the just. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a> and Proverbs 24:15 the word is rendered "dwelling." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-35 Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy his example; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness; to be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearing evils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.</body></html>
