It occurs again in ver. 16, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>. "Length of days" is represented as a blessing in the Old Testament, depending, however, as in the present instance, on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Thus in the fifth commandment it is appended to the honouring of parents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), and it was promised to Solomon, at Gibeon, on the condition that he walked in the way, statutes, and commandments of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>). The promise of prolongation of life is not to be pressed historically as applying to every individual case, but is to be taken as indicating the tendency of keeping the Divine precepts, which, as a rule, ensure preservation of health, and hence "length of days." <span class="cmt_word">Long life</span> (<span class="accented">vush'noth khayyim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">years of life</span>; Targum Jonathan, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, <span class="accented">anni vitae</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The Authorized Version scarcely serves to bring out the sense of the original, as there is practically no difference in meaning between "length of days" and "long life? The idea conveyed in the expression, "years of life," is that of material prosperity. The thought of an extended life is carried on from the preceding expression, but it is amplified and described. The years of life will be many, but they will be years of life in its truest sense, as one of true happiness and enjoyment, free from distracting cares, sickness, and other drawbacks. The Hebrew plural, <span class="accented">khayyim</span>, "lives," is equivalent to the Greek expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "a life worth while living" (cf. Plat., 'Apol.,' 38, A). To the Israelitish mind, the happiness of life consisted in "dwelling in the land" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-30.htm">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>, etc.), and "abiding in the house of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a>) (Zockler). The conjecture that the plural, <span class="accented">khayyim</span>, signifies the present and the future life, is unfounded. The scope of the promise before us is confined to the present stage of existence, and it is negatived also by the similar use of the plural in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-5.htm">Proverbs 16:5</a>, "In the light of the king's countenance is life (<span class="accented">khayyim</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," where <span class="accented">khayyim</span> cannot possibly refer to the future life. <span class="accented">Khayyim</span> stands for life in its fulness. "Godliness" has indeed, as St. Paul wrote to Timothy, "promise of the life that now is, aud of that which is to come" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Peace</span> (<span class="accented">shalom</span>). The verb <span class="accented">shalam</span>, from which the substantive <span class="accented">shalom</span> is derived, signifies "to be whole, sound, safe," and hence "peace" means internal and external contentment, and tran-quillity of mind arising from the sense of safety. In ver. 17 the ways of Wisdom are designated <span class="accented">peace.</span> While, on the one hand, peace is represented by the psalmist as the possession of those who love God's Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-165.htm">Psalm 119:165</a>), on the other, it is denied the wicked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall they add to thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall the precepts and commands bring (Zockler) or heap upon (Muffet) thee. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 In the way of believing obedience to God's commandments health and peace may commonly be enjoyed; and though our days may not be long upon earth, we shall live for ever in heaven. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing: live up to them, keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfort of them. We must trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he is able and wise to do what is best. Those who know themselves, find their own understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission. It is promised, He shall direct thy paths; so that thy way shall be safe and good, and happy at last.</body></html>
