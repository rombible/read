The oppressor is here included under the more general term, "the froward." <span class="cmt_word">The froward;</span> <span class="accented">naloz</span>, hiph. participle from <span class="accented">luz</span>, "to bend aside," and hence a perverted or wicked man, one who turns aside from the way of uprightness, a transgressor of the Law (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); and so the opposite of "the righteous," <span class="accented">y'sharim</span>, "the upright," those who pursue the path of justness, or the straightforward. <span class="cmt_word">Abomination</span> (<span class="accented">toevah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an abhorrence, something which, being impure and unclean (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), is especially abhorrent to Jehovah. In some passages it is connected with idolatry, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-24.htm">1 Kings 14:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>, but is never used in this sense in the Proverbs, where it occurs about twenty times (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1, 20</a>, etc.). The passage shows that prosperity and worldly success are not always a true measure of Divine favour. <span class="cmt_word">His secret</span> (<span class="accented">sodo</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">sermocinatio.</span> Here <span class="accented">sod</span> probably means "familiar intercourse," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; and hence the special favour with which Jehovah regards the upright, by revealing to them what he conceals item others, or his friendship (compare what our Lord says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-14.htm">John 15:14, 15</a>). Dathe translates "probis vero est familiaris." Gesenius says <span class="accented">sod</span> properly means "a couch," or <span class="accented">triclinium</span> on which people recline; but Delitzsch derives it from the root sod, "to be firm," "compressed," and states that it therefore means properly "a being together, or sitting together." The LXX. eontinues the "froward man" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) as the subject, and renders, "Every transgressor is impure before God, and does not sit together with (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) the just." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-35 Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy his example; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness; to be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearing evils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.</body></html>
