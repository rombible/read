In doing so, he reverts to his main subject, which is Wisdom, or the fear of the Lord (see ver. 7 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>), and pronounces a panegyric upon her, comparing her, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28.htm">Job 28</a>, with treasures whose value she exceeds, and showing wherein that value consists, viz. in the gifts which she confers on man. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Happy is the man</span> (<span class="accented">ash'rey adam</span>); literally, <span class="accented">blessings of the man.</span> The plural of "excellence" used here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>, to raise the sense. The man who has found Wisdom is supremely blessed. Beds connects this blessedness immediately with God's chastisements in the preceding verse. So Delitzsch. <span class="cmt_word">That findeth</span> (<span class="accented">matsa</span>); properly, <span class="accented">hath found.</span> "The perfect expresses permanent possession, just as the imperfect, <span class="accented">yaphik</span>, denotes a continually renewed and repeated attaining" (Zockler). The Vulgate also uses the perfect, <span class="accented">invenit</span>, "hath found;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>, "who found" - the aorist. <span class="cmt_word">The man that getteth understanding</span> (<span class="accented">adam yaphik t'vunah</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the man that draweth out understanding</span>, as in the margin. <span class="accented">Yaphik</span> is the hiph. future or imperfect of <span class="accented">puk</span>, the primary meaning of which is <span class="accented">educere</span>, "to draw out," "to bring forth." This verb is used in two widely different senses. In the first place, it is equivalent to "bring forth" or "draw out" in the sense of <span class="accented">imparting</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>, "If thou <span class="accented">draw out</span> thy soul to the hungry," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> impart benefits to them; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>, "That our garners may be full, <span class="accented">affording</span> all manner of store," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> yielding, giving out, presenting for our benefit. Its second sense is that of attaining, drawing out from another for one's own use. In this sense it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>, where it is rendered "obtain." The latter sense is the one that suits the present passage, and best agrees with the corresponding <span class="accented">matsa.</span> The man is blessed who draws forth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> obtains, understanding from God for himself. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">qui affluit prudentia</span>, "who overflows with understanding," or, has understanding in abundance; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, equivalent to "who saw." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-20 No precious jewels or earthly treasures are worthy to be compared with true wisdom, whether the concerns of time or eternity be considered. We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal to make good all his promises.</body></html>
