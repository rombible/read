So Munster, Zockler, Wardlaw. But it seems better to understand it (as Mercerus, Lapide, Delitzsch, and Authorized Version) of the fertilization of the earth by rivers, streams, etc., which burst forth from the interior of the earth. In this sense the correspondence is preserved with the second hemistich. where the atmospheric influence is referred to as conducing to the same end. The teacher passes from the creation to the wonderful means which Jehovah employs through Wisdom to sustain his work. <span class="accented">The depths</span> (<span class="accented">t'homoth</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">abyssi</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, are here "the internal water stores of the earth" (Delitzsch), and not the depths of the ocean, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24, 27, 28</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. <span class="accented">Are broken up</span> (<span class="accented">niv'kau</span>); properly, <span class="accented">were broken up</span>, niph. perfect of <span class="accented">baka</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to cleave asunder, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to break forth, as water, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The perfect describes a past act, but one that is still continuing in effect. Cf. Vulgate <span class="accented">eruperunt</span>, "they burst forth;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, aorist 2 passive of <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, "to burst forth," Targum, <span class="accented">rupti sunt</span>; and Syriac, <span class="accented">ruptae sunt.</span> The idea of division or separation is present, but it is not the predominant idea. There seems to be no allusion here either to the Deluge (Beds), nor to the cleaving of the waters of the Red Sea (Gejerus), though both of these historical events were undoubtedly well known to the teacher. And the clouds drop down the dew. <span class="accented">The clouds</span> (<span class="accented">sh'khakim</span>) are properly the <span class="accented">ether</span>, the higher and colder regions of the atmosphere, and then "the clouds," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>, which are formed by the condensation of vapours drawn by solar influence from the surface of the earth - seas, rivers, etc. The singular <span class="accented">shakhak</span> signifies "dust," and. secondly "a cloud," evidently from the minute particles of moisture of which a cloud is composed. <span class="accented">Drop down</span> (<span class="accented">yir'aphu</span>, kal future of <span class="accented">raaph</span>, used as a present or imperfect); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "let flow." The clouds discharge their contents in showers, or distil at evening in refreshing dew. Modern science agrees with the meteorological fact here alluded to, of the reciprocal action of the heavens and the earth. The moisture drawn from the earth returns again "to water the earth, that it may bring forth and bud, to give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>). <span class="accented">Dew</span>; <span class="accented">tal</span>, here used not only of dew, but of rain in gentle and fructifying showers. The Arabic word signifies "light rain;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "dew." Moses, in describing the blessing of Israel, says, "His heavens shall drop down dew" in the same sense (Deuteronomy 38:28; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-28.htm">Job 36:28</a>). The fertilization of the earth is ordered by the Divine Wisdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-20 No precious jewels or earthly treasures are worthy to be compared with true wisdom, whether the concerns of time or eternity be considered. We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal to make good all his promises.</body></html>
