With this verse begin the commandments which are alluded to in ver. 1. The Hebrew <span class="accented">khesed</span> has to be understood in its widest sense, though the Vulgate and the LXX. confine it to one aspect of its meaning, viz. that which refers to the relation of man to man, to the pity evoked by the sight of another's misfortunes, and to ahnsgiving. The radical meaning of the word is "ardent desire," from the root <span class="accented">khasad</span>, "to eagerly or ardently desire." Delitzsch describes it as "well affectedness." Predicated of God, it indicates God's love and grace towards man; predicated of man, it signifies man's love toward s God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> piety, or man's love towards his neighbour, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> humanity. Where this mercy or love is exhibited in man it finds expression in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> mutual outward help; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> forgiveness of offences; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> sympathy of feeling, which leads to interchange of thought, and so to the development of the spiritual life (see Elster, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word carries with it the ideas of kindlim as, benignity (Targum, <span class="accented">benignitas</span>), and grace (Syriac, <span class="accented">gratia</span>)<span class="accented">. Truth</span> (<span class="accented">emeth</span>); properly, <span class="accented">firmness</span>, or <span class="accented">stability</span>, and so fidelity in which one performs one's promise. Truth is that absolute integrity of character, beth in word and deed, which secures the unhesitating confidence of all (Wardlaw). Umbreit and Elster designate it as inward truthfulness, the <span class="accented">pectus rectum</span>, the very essence of a true man. As <span class="accented">khesed</span> excludes all selfishness and hate, so <span class="accented">emeth</span> excludes all hypocrisy and dissimulation. These two virtues are frequently combined in the Proverbs (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>) and Psalms (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-5.htm">Psalm 108:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-2.htm">Psalm 138:2</a>), and, when predicated of man, indicate the highest normal standard of moral perfection (Zockler). The two ideas are again brought together in the New Testament phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>, "to speak the truth in love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>). There seems little ground for the remark of Salasius, that "mercy" refers to our neighbours, and "truth" to God. Each virtue, in fact, has a twofold reference - one to God, the other to man. The promise in ver. 4, that the exercise of these virtues procures favour with God and man, implies this twofold aspect. Bind them about thy neck; either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as ornaments worn about the neck (Gejerus, Zockler); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as amulets or talismans, which were worn from a superstitious notion to ward off danger (Umbreit and Vaihinger); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as treasures which one wears attached to the neck by a chain to guard against their loss (Hitzig); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> as a signet, which was carried on a string round the neck (Delitzsch). The true reference of the passage seems to lie between (1) and (3). The latter adapts itself to the parallel expression, "Write them on the tablet of thine heart," and also agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-21.htm">Proverbs 6:21</a>, "Tie them about thy neck," the idea being that of their careful preservation against loss. The former meaning, however, seems preferable. Mercy and truth are to be ornaments of the character, to be bound round the neck, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worn at all times (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, "For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thine head, and chains about thy neck." See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11</a>). The imagery of the binding is evidently taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, and is suggestive of the tephillim, or phylacteries. <span class="cmt_word">Write them upon the table of thine heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> inscribe them. mercy and truth, deeply there, impress them thoroughly and indelibly upon thine heart, so that they may never be forgotten, and may form the mainspring of your actions. The expression implies that the heart is to be in entire union with their dictates. <span class="accented">The table</span> (<span class="accented">luakh</span>) was the tablet expressly prepared for writing by being polished, corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the writing table of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-63.htm">Luke 1:63</a>, which, however, was probably covered with wax. The inscription was made with the <span class="accented">stylus.</span> The same word is used of the <span class="accented">tables</span> of stone, on which the ten commandments were written with the finger of God, end allusion is in all probability here made to that fact (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>). The expression, "the tables of the heart," occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>); and is used by AEschylus, 'Pro.,' 789, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "the tablets of the heart." This clause is omitted in the LXX. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 In the way of believing obedience to God's commandments health and peace may commonly be enjoyed; and though our days may not be long upon earth, we shall live for ever in heaven. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing: live up to them, keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfort of them. We must trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he is able and wise to do what is best. Those who know themselves, find their own understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission. It is promised, He shall direct thy paths; so that thy way shall be safe and good, and happy at last.</body></html>
