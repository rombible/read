They are corrections, but they are the corrections of love. One of the most touching relationships of life, and that with which we are most familiar, viz. that of father and son, is employed to reconcile us to Jehovah's afflictive dispensations. A comparison is drawn. God corrects those whom he loves after the same manner as a father corrects ("correcteth" has to be understood from the first hemistich) the son whom he loves. The idea of the passage is evidently taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>, "Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee." The idea of the paternal relationship of God to mankind is found elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>), and especially finds expression in the Lord's prayer. When the truth of this passage is learned, we shall be drawn to, rather than repelled from, God by his corrections. The gracious end of earthly trials is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6, 2</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a> (Wardlaw). "These gracious words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12</a>.) are written in Holy Scripture for our comfort and instruction; that we should patiently and with thanksgiving bear our heavenly Father's correction, whensoever by any manner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit us" (see Visitation Office). <span class="cmt_word">Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth</span> (<span class="accented">vuk'av eth-ben yir'tseh</span>); literally, <span class="accented">even as a father the son be delighteth in.</span> Various renderings have been given to this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Delitzsch, De Wette, <span class="accented">et al.</span>, agree with the Authorized Version, and take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">vav, as</span> explicative, and <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, "in whom he delighteth," as a relative sentence. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> is used in this explanatory sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a> (see Gesenius, &sect; 155, 1 <span class="accented">a</span>). The relative <span class="accented">usher</span>, "whom," is omitted in the original, according to the rule that the relative is omitted, especially in poetry, where it would stand as a pronoun in the nominative or accusative case (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>, "And he falls into the pit (which) he made;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-13.htm">Proverbs 5:13</a>). We have the same elision of the relative in the English colloquial expression, "the friend I met" (see Gesenius, &sect; 123:3, <span class="accented">a</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig and Zockler translate, "and holds him dear as a father his son." This, though grammatically correct, does not preserve the parallelism. It serves only to expand the idea of love, whereas the predominant idea of the verse is that of correction, to which love is an accessory idea (see Delitzsch). For similar parallels, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a> as before, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>. In the comparison which is instituted, <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, "in whom he delighteth," corresponds with <span class="accented">eth asher ye'hav y'hovah</span>, "whom the Lord loveth," and not with <span class="accented">yokiah</span>, "correcteth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Kamph translates, "and (dealeth) as a father (who) wisheth well to his son." This is substantially the same as the Authorized Version, except that in the relative sentence "son" is made accusative after <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, here translated, "wisheth well to," and the emitted relative (<span class="accented">asher</span>) is placed in the nominative instead of the accusative case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The variation in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "and scourgeth every son whom he rcceiveth," cited literally in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>, evidently arises from the translators having read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, (<span class="accented">yakev</span>), "he scourgeth" for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">vuk'av</span>), "even as a father." It will be seen that this alteration could be easily effected by a change in the Masoretic pointing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">et quasi pater in filio complacet sibi. He delighteth</span>; <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span> is from <span class="accented">ratsah</span>, "to be delighted" with any person or thing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 There is not a greater enemy to the fear of the Lord in the heart, than self-conceit of our own wisdom. The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.</body></html>
