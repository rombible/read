The gain arising from trading in wisdom is better than that which arises from trading in silver. <span class="accented">Sakh'rah</span> is the gain or profit arising from merchandise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from trading. It denotes the act itself of gaining. The root <span class="accented">sakrah</span>, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, signifies "to go about for the sake of traffic," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to trade. There may be an allusion here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a>, to the new commerce (Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">The gain thereof</span> (<span class="accented">t'vuathah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gain existing in, and going along with, Wisdom herself; gain, therefore, in a different sense from that indicated in <span class="accented">sakh'rah.</span> Gesenius takes it as "gain resulting from Wisdom," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-19.htm">Proverbs 8:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>. The word is used of the produce of the earth, the idea apparently embodied in the Vulgate <span class="accented">fructus.</span> In this case there may be a reference to ver. 18, where Wisdom is said to be a "tree of life." The LXX. omits the latter clause of this verse. The sense is, "The possession of Wisdom herself is better than fine gold." <span class="cmt_word">Fine gold</span> (<span class="accented">karuts</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">aurum purum</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">aurum purissimum. Kharuts</span> is the poetic word for gold, so called, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from its brilliancy, and then akin to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Curtius); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from its being dug up, from the root <span class="accented">kharats</span>, "to cut into or dig up, to sharpen." It evidently means the finest and purest gold, and is here contrasted with silver (<span class="accented">keseph</span>). The word is translated "choice gold" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; "gold" simply in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; "yellow gold" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a>; and "fine gold" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>. In the Version Junii et Tremellii it appears as <span class="accented">effosum aurum</span>, "gold dug up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> gold in its native, unalloyed state. The Targum Jonathan understands it of "molten gold" (<span class="accented">aurum conflatum</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-20 No precious jewels or earthly treasures are worthy to be compared with true wisdom, whether the concerns of time or eternity be considered. We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal to make good all his promises.</body></html>
