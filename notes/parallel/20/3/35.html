"to lift up, exalt;" and whether the plural, <span class="accented">k'silim</span>, in a distributive sense, as in ver. 18, or <span class="accented">kalon</span>, is the subject.

They "glory in their shame" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>); or shame renders them conspicuous as warning examples (Ewald); or, as Dathe explains it, "Stulti infamia sunt famosi," "Fools become famous by infamy;" or as Rabbi Levi, "Shame exalts them as into the air, and makes them vanish away." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Fools exalt shame, prize what others despise" (Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Umbreit, Bertheau, Zockler, render, "Shame sweeps fools away," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lifts them up in order to sweep away and destroy them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The true rendering seems to be given by Michaelis, "Fools carry away shame" as their portion. So the Targum, Delitzsch, Hitzig, Wordsworth. They look for "promotion." They attain such as it is, but the end of their attainments is "shame and everlasting contempt." As the wise inherit glory, so fools get as their portion shame and ignominy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-35 Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy his example; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness; to be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearing evils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.</body></html>
