We are nat to strive or quarrel with a man unless he has first given us offence. So Le Clerc, "Nisi injuria prior lacessiverit." The admonition is directed against those who, from spite, jealousy, or other reasons, "stir up strife all the day long" with those who are quiet and peaceable. Strive. The Keri here reads <span class="accented">tariv</span> for the Khetib <span class="accented">taruv</span>, but without any change of meaning. The verb <span class="accented">ruv</span>, from which <span class="accented">taruv</span>, is "to strive or contend with the hand and with blows," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-7.htm">Deuteronomy 33:7</a>; or with words, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a> (cf. the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne contendas</span>; and the LXX, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "Do not exercise enmity," from the unusual <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>. <span class="accented">Ruv</span> is here followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">im</span>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-30.htm">Genesis 26:30</a> Its forensic sense, "to contend with in law," does not strictly apply here, though the precept may be taken as discouraging litigation (Lapide). <span class="cmt_word">Without cause</span> (<span class="accented">khinnam</span>); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">frustra</span>; further explained in the concluding clause (see on Proverbs 1:17). <span class="cmt_word">If he have done thee no harm.</span> The phrase, <span class="accented">gumal raah</span>, is to bring evil upon any one (Schultens). The verb <span class="accented">gamal</span> signifies "to do, to give, to show to any one." Holdea renders, "Surely he will return thee evil," in the sense that unprovoked attack ensures retaliation.]gut this is to ignore the negative force of <span class="accented">im-lo</span>, "if not." The verb sometimes means "requiting," but not in the passage before us, nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-12.htm">Proverbs 31:12</a>. The Vulgate renders as the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">Cum ipse tibi nihil mali fecerit.</span> It is to be remarked that this precept falls below the moral standard of the New Testament teaching (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-6.htm">1 Corinthians 6:6-8</a>), and of the example of our Lord, of whom it was predicted that "When he was reviled, be reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-35 Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy his example; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness; to be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearing evils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.</body></html>
