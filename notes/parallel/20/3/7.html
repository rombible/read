It is a protest against self-sufficiency, self-conceit, and self-reliance. It says, in effect, "Trust in the Lord, do not trust in yourself." Wisdom, as Michaelis remarks, is to trust in God; to trust in yourself and in your own wisdom is unwisdom. God denounces this spirit: "Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>), because such a spirit leads to the prohibited self-dependence, and is inconsistent with "the tear of the Lord." The precept of the text is reiterated by St. Paul, especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>, "Be not wise in your own conceits" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-3.htm">Galatians 6:3</a>). It commends humility. The diligent search for Wisdom is commanded. The great hindrance to all true wisdom is the thought that we have already attained it (Plumptre). <span class="accented">In thine own eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in thine own estimation; <span class="accented">arbitrio tuo</span> (Trem. et Jun.). <span class="cmt_word">Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</span> The connection of this with the first part of the verse becomes clear upon reflection. "The fear of the Lord" is true wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Fear the Lord, therefore, because it is the best corrective of one's own wisdom, which engenders arrogance, pride, presumption of mind, which, moreover, is deceptive and apt to lead to sin. The fear of the Lord has this other advantage - that it leads to the departure from evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>) It is the mark of the wise man that he fears the Lord, and departs from evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>). These precepts form the two elements of practical piety (Delitzsch), an eminent example of which as Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 There is not a greater enemy to the fear of the Lord in the heart, than self-conceit of our own wisdom. The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.</body></html>
