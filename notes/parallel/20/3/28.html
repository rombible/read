The former precept enjoined the general principle of benevolence when we have the means; this carries on the idea, and is directed against the postponement of giving when we are in a position to give. In effect it says, "Do not defer till tomorrow what you can do today." This "putting off" may arise from avarice, from indolence, or from insolence and contempt. These underlying faults, which are incompatible with neighbourly good wilt, are condenmed by implication. <span class="cmt_word">Unto thy neighbour;</span> <span class="accented">l'reayka</span>, "to thy friends," the word being evidently used distributively. <span class="accented">Reeh</span> is "a companion" or "friend" (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">amico tuo</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">sodali tuo</span>), and generally any other person, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "neighbour." The Authorized Version correctly renders "come again," as <span class="accented">shav</span> is not merely "to return," but to return again to something (so Delitzsch); cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">revertere</span>; and as the words, "tomorrow I will give thee," show. The LXX. adds, "For thou knowest not what the morrow may bring forth," probably from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>. If viewed in respect of the specific claims which servants have for work done, the precept is a re-echo of Leviticus 29:13 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>. In illustration of the general scope of the passage, Grotius quotes, "A slow-footed favour is a favour without favour." Seneca says in the same spirit, "Ingratum est beneficium quod diu inter manus dantis haesit," "The benefit is thankless which sticks long between the hands of the giver" (Seneca, 'Benef.,' 1:2); cf. also <span class="accented">Bis dat qui cito dat.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-35 Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy his example; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness; to be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearing evils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.</body></html>
