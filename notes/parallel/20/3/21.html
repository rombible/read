Since Wisdom is so powerful, then, the teacher argues, she is worthy of being retained and guarded, and able to protect. <span class="accented">Let them not depart</span> (<span class="accented">al-yaluzu</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let them not escape or slip aside from your mind (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">effluant haec ab oculis ruts</span>). They are to be as frontiers between your eyes, as a ring upon your finger. <span class="accented">Yaluzu</span>, from <span class="accented">luz</span>, "to bend aside," <span class="accented">defiectere, a via declinare</span>, which see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>, ought probably to be written <span class="accented">yellezu</span>, on the analogy of the corresponding passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>. The LXX. renders absolutely <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "do not thou pass by," from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, "to flow by," "to pass by, recede" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>, "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to these things, lest at any time we should let them slip (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>)," quoted probably from the LXX. of this passage). The Targum Jonathan reads <span class="accented">ne vilescat</span>, "let it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom, "not become worthless." <span class="accented">Them</span>, included in the verb <span class="accented">yaluzu</span> of which it is subject in the original, is to be referred either to "sound wisdom and discretion" of ver. 21b - so Gejerus, Cartwright, Geier, Umbreit, Hitzig, Zockter, Plumptre (a similar trajection occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, and is used, as here, to give vividness to the description): or to "wisdom, understanding, knowledge," of the preceding verses - so Delitzsch and Holden. The first view in every way seems preferable, and it is no objection to it that "sound wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyyah</span>) and "discretion" (<span class="accented">m'yimmah</span>) are feminine, while the verb "depart" (<span class="accented">yaluzu</span>) is masculine (see Gesenius, *Gram.,' &sect; 147). The Syriac reads, "Let it not become worthless (<span class="accented">ne vile fit</span>) in thine eyes to keep my doctrine and my counsels." <span class="cmt_word">Keep sound wisdom and discretion.</span> <span class="accented">Keep</span>; <span class="accented">n'zor</span>, kal imperative of <span class="accented">natsar</span>, "to watch, guard." For "sound wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyyah</span>), see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>. Here used for "wisdom" (<span class="accented">kokhmah</span>), as "discretion" (<span class="accented">m'zimmah</span>) for "understanding" (<span class="accented">t'vunah</span>), to contrast the absolute wisdom and insight of God with the corresponding attributes in man (see Zockler, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). They belong to God, but are conferred on those who seek after Wisdom, and are then to be guarded as priceless treasures. The Vulgate reads, <span class="accented">custodi legem et consilium</span>; and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">g</span>uard my counsel and thought." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:21-26 Let us not suffer Christ's words to depart from us, but keep sound wisdom and discretion; then shall we walk safely in his ways. The natural life, and all that belongs to it, shall be under the protection of God's providence; the spiritual life, and all its interests, under the protection of his grace, so that we shall be kept from falling into sin or trouble.</body></html>
