The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">yada</span> signifies "to know, recognize." To acknowledge God is, therefore, to recognize, in all our dealings and undertakings, God's overruling providence, which "shapes our ends, rough hew them as we will." It is not a mere theoretical acknowledgment, but one that engages the whole energies of the soul (Delitzsch), and sees in God power, wisdom, providence, goodness, and justice. This meaning is conveyed by the Vulgate <span class="accented">cogitare</span>, which is "to consider" in all parts, "to reflect upon." David's advice to his son Solomon is, "Know thou (<span class="accented">ola</span>) the God of thy father." We may well acknowledge Jehovah; for he "knoweth the way of the righteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). Acknowledging God also implies that we first ascertain whether what we are about to take in hand is in accordance with his precepts, and then look for his direction and illumination (Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall direct thy paths</span> (<span class="accented">v'hu y'yashsher or'khotheyka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he himself shall make them straight, or level, removing all obstacles out of the way; or they shall, under God's direction, prosper and come to a successful issue; they shall be virtuous, inasmuch as deviation into vice will be guarded against, and happy, because they are prosperous. The pronoun <span class="accented">v'hu</span> is emphatic, "he himself;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">et ipse. Yashar</span>, piel. is "to make a way straight," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-21.htm">Proverbs 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>. Cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to cut straight" (see on Proverbs 11:5). God here binds himself by a covenant (Lapide). This power is properly attributed to God, for "it is not in man to direct his steps" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 In the way of believing obedience to God's commandments health and peace may commonly be enjoyed; and though our days may not be long upon earth, we shall live for ever in heaven. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing: live up to them, keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfort of them. We must trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he is able and wise to do what is best. Those who know themselves, find their own understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission. It is promised, He shall direct thy paths; so that thy way shall be safe and good, and happy at last.</body></html>
