Kesel</span>, primarily "loin" or "flank," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-14.htm">Leviticus 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-27.htm">Job 15:27</a>, is apparently used here in its secondary meaning of "confidence," "hope," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-7.htm">Psalm 78:7</a>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">v</span>') prefixed is what is usually termed the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> <span class="accented">essentiae</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> <span class="accented">pleonasticum</span> (equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">tanquam</span>, "as"), and serves to emphasize the connection between the predicate "thy confidence" and the subject "Jehovah" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; see Ewaht, 'Lehrb.,' 217<span class="accented">, f.</span>; and Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 154). Jehovah shall be in the highest sense your ground and object of confidence. Delitzsch describes <span class="accented">kesel</span> as confidence in the presence of evil: Jehovah in the presence of the "sudden fear," and of "the desolation of the wicked," the evils and calamities which overwhelm the wicked, shall be thy confidence. The sense of his all-encircling protection will render you undismayed. The meaning given to <span class="accented">kesel</span> as "foolhardiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>) and "folly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>). and the connection of <span class="accented">kesel</span> with <span class="accented">k'silim</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>, comes from the root idea <span class="accented">kasal</span>, "to be fleshly, or fat," the signification of which branches out on the one side into strength and boldness, and on the other into languor and inertness, and so folly or confidence in self (Schultens, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>). The Talmudic rendering of the Rabbi Salomon approximates to this meaning, "and the things in which you seemed to be foolish (<span class="accented">desipere videbaris</span>) he will be at once present with you." Others, as Ziegler, Muentinghe, gave <span class="accented">kesel</span> its primary meaning, and translate, "Jehovah shall be as thy loins," the loins being regarded as the emblem of strength. Jehovah shall be your strength. But <span class="accented">kesel</span> does not appear to have this local application here. Wherever it is used in this sense, as in Job and Leviticus cited above, there is something in the context to point it out as a part of the body. Compare, however, the Vulgate. <span class="accented">in latere suo</span>, "in thy side or flank." The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "over all thy ways." From being taken (<span class="accented">millaked</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne capiaris</span>, "lest thou be taken." The meaning is, Jehovah will be your protection against all the snares and traps which the impious lay for you. <span class="accented">Leked</span>, "a being taken," is from <span class="accented">lakad</span>, "to take or catch animals" in a net or in snares. It only occurs here in the Proverbs. Its unusual appearance, together with other reasons, not tenable, however, has led Hitzig to reject vers. 22-26 as an interpolation. The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, pavorem. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch, is used subjectively, and means "any vehement emotion." The word only occurs once in the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, where it is evidently quoted from the passage before us, in an objective sense, and designates some external cause of terror (cf. Authorized Version, "and be not afraid with any amazement;" see also Book of Common Prayer: 'Solemnization of Matrimony,' <span class="accented">ad fin</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:21-26 Let us not suffer Christ's words to depart from us, but keep sound wisdom and discretion; then shall we walk safely in his ways. The natural life, and all that belongs to it, shall be under the protection of God's providence; the spiritual life, and all its interests, under the protection of his grace, so that we shall be kept from falling into sin or trouble.</body></html>
