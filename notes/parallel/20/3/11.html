A wonderful advance beyond the teaching of the Pentateuch: <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Deuteronomy 28, in which the Jews had to be treated as children, and punishment or reward follow as the immediate consequence of bad or good behaviour. Under such a discipline misfortune could only be regarded as a punishment, a sign of God's displeasure; but now a further manifestation of His dealings with man is made. When He sends trouble upon His children, He is no longer to be regarded as an offended father punishing their faults, but as one who in love is correcting them. Even the New Testament quotes these words with approval, and without adding anything to their teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-5.htm" title="And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:">Hebrews 12:5-13</a>). There it is shown how all God's children must, without exception, submit to this discipline.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord.</span> The teacher, in vers. 11 and 12, passes to another phase of life. The thought of prosperity suggests the opposite one of adversity. Abundant prosperity shall flow from honouring Jehovah, but he sometimes and not unfrequently sends affliction, and, indeed, without this life would be incomplete. The object of the exhortation is, as Delitzsch states, to show that, as in prosperity God should not be forgotten, so one should not suffer himself to be estranged by days of adversity. Submission is counselled on the ground that, when Jehovah afflicts, he does so in the spirit of love, and for good. The "chastening" and "correction," though presenting God in an attitude of anger, are in reality not the punishment of an irate God. The verse before us is evidently copied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>, "Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth, therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty;" and the whole passage is cited again in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5, 6</a>). It has been said that ver. 11 expresses the problem of the Book of Job, and ver. 12 its solution (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Despise not</span> (<span class="accented">al-timas</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne abjicias</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The verb mass is first "to reject," and then "to despise and contemn." The Targum Jonathan puts the thought in a stronger form, <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">execreris</span>, "do not curse." They despise the chastening of Jehovah who, when they see his hand in it, do not humbly and submissively bow, but resist and become refractory, or, as it is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>, when their "heart fretteth against the Lord." Job, notwithstanding his bitter complaints, was on the whole, and in his better moments, an example of the proper state of mind under correction (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>). Jonah, in treating contemptuously the procedure of God, is an exemplification of the contrary spirit, which is condemned implicitly in the text (Wardlaw). <span class="accented">Chastening</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>); i.e. correction not by reproof only, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a> and Proverbs 8:30; but by punishment also. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a>. The meaning here is expressed by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is "instruction by punishment," discipline, or schooling (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">disciplina</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Neither be weary</span> (<span class="accented">al-takots</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not loathe, abhor, feel disgust nor vexation towards. The expression, "do not loathe," is a climax to the other, "despise not." It represents a more deeply seated aversion to Jehovah's plans. Gesenius takes the primary meaning of <span class="accented">kuts</span> to be that of vomiting. The word before us certainly denotes loathing or nausea, and is used in this sense by the Israelites in their complaints against God and against Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a>). The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in quoting the passage, adopts the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "nor faint;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne deficias, i.e.</span> "do not give way to despondency." <span class="cmt_word">Correction</span>. This word, like <span class="accented">musar</span> above, has a twofold meaning of either punishment or chastening, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-14.htm">Psalm 73:14</a>; or reproof, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a>; 25:30; 5:12; 27:5; 29:15, where it also occurs. It is here used in the former sense. To loathe the correction of Jehovah is to allow it to completely estrange us from him. We faint under it when, by dwelling on or brooding over, or bemoaning the trial, the spirit sinks to faintness. To faint at correction ignores the belief in the truth that "all things work together for good to them that love God." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 There is not a greater enemy to the fear of the Lord in the heart, than self-conceit of our own wisdom. The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.</body></html>
