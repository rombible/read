It is the first lesson to be learnt by all, and no less necessary for the Jew than for the Christian. Without this reliance on or confidence in God, it is impossible to carry out any of the precepts of religion. <span class="accented">Batakh</span> is, properly, "to cling to," and so passes to the meaning of "to confide in," "to set one's hope and confidence upon." The preposition <span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> indicates the direction which the confidence is to take (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lean</span> (<span class="accented">tishshaen</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">innitaris</span>; followed by <span class="accented">el</span>, like <span class="accented">b'takh</span>, with which it is very similar in meaning. <span class="accented">Shaan</span>, not used in kal, in hiph. signifies "to lean upon, rest upon," just as man rests upon a spear for support. Its metaphorical use, <span class="accented">to repose confidence in</span>, is derived from the practice of kings who were accustomed to appear in public leaning on their friends and ministers; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2, 17</a> (Gesenius). The admonition does not mean that we are not to <span class="accented">use</span> our own understanding (<span class="accented">binab</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> form plans with discretion, and employ legitimate means in the pursuit of our ends; but that, when we use it, we are to depend upon God and his directing and overruling providence (Wardlaw); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23, 24</a>. "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom," etc. The teacher points out not only where we are to rely, but also where we are not to rely. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 In the way of believing obedience to God's commandments health and peace may commonly be enjoyed; and though our days may not be long upon earth, we shall live for ever in heaven. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing: live up to them, keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfort of them. We must trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he is able and wise to do what is best. Those who know themselves, find their own understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission. It is promised, He shall direct thy paths; so that thy way shall be safe and good, and happy at last.</body></html>
