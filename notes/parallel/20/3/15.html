No unanimous opinion has been arrived at as to the real signification of the word here translated "rubies." The majority of the rabbins (among them Rashi), and Bochart, Hartman, Bohlen, Lee on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-18.htm">Job 38:18</a>, and Zockler, render it "pearls." Its meaning seems to lie between this and "corals," the rendering adopted by Michaelis, Gesenius, and Delitzsch (following Fleischer), who says that the Hebrew <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> corresponds with the Arabia word whose root idea is "shooting forth," and means "a branch." The peculiar branching form in which corm is found favours this opinion, which is strengthened by the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, where we get additional information as to color, "They [the Nazarites] were more ruddy in body than rubies," a description of which would apply to "coral," but is scarcely applicable to "pearls." The various versions suggest the further idea that <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> was a descriptive word used to denote precious stones in general. The LXX. renders, "She is more precious than precious stones (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." So the Targum Jonathan, Syriac, and Arabic. The Vulgate renders. "She is more precious than all riches (<span class="accented">cunctis opibus</span>)." The word <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> only occurs here (Keri) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-15.htm">Proverbs 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>; and in Job and Lamentations as above. This passage, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>, which is an almost literal repetition of it, are imitations of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>. The identification of <span class="accented">p'ninim</span> with "pearls" may have suggested our Lord's parable of the pearl of great price (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45, 46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the things thou canst desire</span> (<span class="accented">kal-khaphatseyka</span>); literally, <span class="accented">all thy desires.</span> Here everything in which you have pleasure, or all your precious things; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">omnia, quae desiderantur.</span> The comparison, which has risen from the less to the more valuable, culminates in this comprehensive expression. There is nothing, neither silver, gold, precious stones, nor anything precious, which is an equivalent (<span class="accented">shavah</span>) to Wisdom in value. How it shows, when everything is put before us to choose from, that, like Solomon at Gibeon, we should prefer wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-11.htm">1 Kings 3:11-13</a>)! In the second half of this verse the LXX. substitutes, "No evil thing competes with her; she is well known to all that approach her." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-20 No precious jewels or earthly treasures are worthy to be compared with true wisdom, whether the concerns of time or eternity be considered. We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal to make good all his promises.</body></html>
