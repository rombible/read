Success and wealth may follow from severity and extortion, but the man who acquires prosperity by these means is not to be envied even by the victim of his oppression (for the verb, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-17.htm">Proverbs 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1, 19</a>). <span class="accented">The oppressor</span> (<span class="accented">ish khamas</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a man of violence</span> (see margin).

It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.</body></html>
