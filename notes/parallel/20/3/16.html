Wisdom is here represented as holding in her right hand that which is previously promised to obedience. Length of days is the blessing of blessings, the condition of all prosperity and enjoyment, and hence is placed in the right hand, the chief place, for among the Hebrews and other Oriental nations, as also among the Greeks the right hand was regarded as the position of highest honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; 1 Macc. 10:63; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24</a>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>. in which the psalmist says of Jehovah, "In thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore." The two hands, the right and the left, signify the abundance of Wisdom's gifts. <span class="cmt_word">Riches and honour</span> stand here for prosperity in general. The same expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-8.htm">Proverbs 8:8</a>, where riches are explained as "durable riches." A spiritual interpretation can, of course, be given to this passage - length of days being understood of eternal life; riches, of heavenly riches; and honour, not "the honour that cometh of men," but honour conferred by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>:44; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>); see Wardlaw, <span class="accented">in loc.</span> The thought of the verse is, of course, that Wisdom not only holds these blessings in her hands, but also confers them on those who seek her. The LXX. adds, "Out of her month proceedeth righteousness; justice and mercy she beareth upon her tongue;" possibly suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>. The words of the teacher remind us of the saying of Menander, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "He who excels in prudence possesses all things." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-20 No precious jewels or earthly treasures are worthy to be compared with true wisdom, whether the concerns of time or eternity be considered. We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal to make good all his promises.</body></html>
