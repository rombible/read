The meaning of this expression lies between "fabricating evil" and "ploughing evil." The radical meaning of <span class="accented">kharash</span>, from which <span class="accented">takharosh</span>, is "to cut into," "to inscribe" letters on a tablet, cognate with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to cut into." But it is used in the sense of "to plough" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>, "They that plough iniquity (<span class="accented">khar'shey aven</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, "The ploughers ploughed (<span class="accented">khar'shim khar'shim</span>) upon my back" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>). This also appears from the context to be the meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>. With these we may compare such expressions as "to plough a lie" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered in the Authorized Version, "Devise not a lie"); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>, and "to sow iniquity," <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a> - a cognate figure. "To plough evil" is to devise evil, to prepare for it, just in the same way as a ploughman prepares the land for sowing. In this sense the verb is understood by the older commentators and by Ewald and Delitzsch. On the other hand, the verb may be used in its other signification, "to fabricate," and hence "to contrive." The noun <span class="accented">kharash</span> is an artificer of iron, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>). "To fabricate evil" is, of course, as the Authorized Version "to devise evil." The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc4;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to build," inclines to this sense. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne moliaris</span>, does not clear up the point, though <span class="accented">moliri</span>, usually "to contrive," is used by Virgil, 'Georg.,' 1:494, "moliri terrain," of working or tilling the ground. The verb also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-20.htm">Proverbs 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cure ille in te habet fiduciam</span>, "when he has confidence in thee;" so the LXX.; or, as the Targum and Syriac, "when he dwells with thee in peace." <span class="accented">To dwell</span> (<span class="accented">yashar</span>) is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> "to sit with any one," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to associate familiarly with him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4, 5</a>); but it also has the meaning , "to dwell," and the participle <span class="accented">yoshev</span>, here used; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>, means "an inhabitant, a dweller." <span class="accented">Securely</span> (<span class="accented">lavetah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with full trust (see on ver. 23). Devising evil against a friend is at any time reprehensible, but to do so when he confides in and is altogether unsuspicious of you, is an act of the greatest treachery, and an outrage on all law. human and Divine. It implies dissimulation. It is the very sin by which "the devil beguiled Eve through his subtlety" (Wardlaw). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:27-35 Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy his example; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness; to be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearing evils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.</body></html>
