"his anger;" <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>). The wording of the second hemistich confirms this rendering. A fool pours out his wrath, restrained by no consideration. It is a wise maxim that says, "Command your temper, lest it command you;" and again, "When passion enters in at the foregate, wisdom goes out at the postern." So we have the word attributed to Evenus Parius - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Wrath often hath revealed man's hidden mind,<br />Than madness more pernicious."</span> A wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. This clause is capable of more than one explanation. The Authorized Version says that the wise man restrains his own anger till he can give it proper vent. The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> occurs nowhere else, and is rendered "at last," "finally," and by Delitzsch, "within," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in his heart. The verb rendered "keepeth in" (<span class="accented">shabach</span>) is rather "to calm," "to hush," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>, "Which stilleth the noise of the seas." So we have the meaning: The wise man calms the auger within him; according to the proverb, <span class="accented">Irae dilatio</span>, <span class="accented">mentis pacatio</span>. Or the anger calmed may be that of the fool: The wise man appeases it after it has been exhibited; he knows how to apply soothing remedies to the angry man, and in the end renders him calm and amenable to reason. This seems the most suitable explanation. Septuagint, "A wise man husbands it (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in part." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:11. He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel. 12. One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his servants to become liars and false accusers. 13. Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. 14. The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for. 15. Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence. 16. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience. 17. Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss. 18. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! That gospel is an open vision, which holds forth Christ, which humbles the sinner and exalts the Saviour, which promotes holiness in the life and conversation: and these are precious truths to keep the soul alive, and prevent it from perishing.</body></html>
