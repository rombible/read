But here the warning seems to be rather against spoiling a slave by over-indulgence, lest he at the last forget his position, just as old and petted servants are apt to become somewhat dictatorial.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child.</span> The verb <span class="accented">panak</span>, which is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, is rightly here translated as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui delicate nutrit</span>. It refers to the spoiling a person by over-refinement, luxury, and pampering - a treatment peculiarly unsuitable in the case of a bond servant, and one which makes such forgetful of his dependent position. Septuagint, "He that liveth wantonly (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fb7;</span>) from childhood shall be a servant." Shall have him become his son at the length; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. at length, like "at the last," equivalent to "at last" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a>). The word rendered "son" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">manon</span>) is of doubtful meaning, and has been variously understood or misunderstood by interpreters. Septuagint, "And in the end shall have pain (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) over himself;" Symmachus, "shall have murmuring (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Postea sentiet eum contumacem</span>. Ewald translates "ungrateful;" Delitzsch, "place of increase," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a household of pampered scapegraces; but one does not see how the disaster can be called a place or a house. It seems safest in this uncertainty to adopt the Jewish interpretation of "progeny:" "he will be as a son." The pampered servant will end by claiming the privileges of a son, and perhaps ousting the legitimate children from their inheritance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>; and the case of Ziba and Mephibosheth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>). "Fodder, a stick, and burdens are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work for a servant. If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest; but if thou let him go idle, he will seek liberty" (Ecclus. 33:24, etc.). Spiritual writers have applied this proverb to the pampering of the flesh, which ought to be under the control of its master, the spirit, but which, if gratified and unrestrained, gets the upper hand, and, like a spoiled servant, dictates to its lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:19. Here is an unprofitable, slothful, wicked servant; one that serves not from conscience, or love, but from fear. 20. When a man is self-conceited, rash, and given to wrangling, there is more hope of the ignorant and profligate. 21. Good usage to a servant does not mean indulgence, which would ruin even a child. The body is a servant to the soul; those that humour it, and are over-tender of it, will find it forget its place. 22. An angry, passionate disposition makes men provoking to one another, and provoking to God. 23. Only those who humble themselves shall be exalted and established. 24. The receiver is as bad as the thief. 25. Many are ashamed to own Christ now; and he will not own them in the day of judgment. But he that trusts in the Lord will be saved from this snare.</body></html>
