Compare "a man of sorrows" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). The hardening of the neck is a metaphor derived from obstinate draught animals who will not submit to the yoke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>). Christ calls his yoke easy, and bids his followers to bear it bravely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>. etc.). The reproofs may arise from the Holy Spirit and the conscience, from the teaching of the past, or from the counsel of friends. The LXX. (as some other Jewish interpreters) takes the expression in the text actively, "A man who reproves (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is better than one of stiff neck." <span class="cmt_word">Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-10.htm">Proverbs 15:10</a>). The incorrigible and self-deluding sinners shall come to a fearful and sudden end, though retribution be delayed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>). And there is no hope in their end; despising all correction, they can have no possibility of restoration. We may refer, as an illustration, to that terrible passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc.), and to the fate of the Jews unto the present day. Septuagint, "For when he is burning suddenly, there is no remedy." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1 If God wounds, who can heal? The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ. 2. The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked. 3. Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts. 4. The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people. 5. Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct. 6. Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety. 7. This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked. 8. The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God. 9. If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done. 10. Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men. The just, whom the blood-thirsty hate, gladly do any thing for their salvation.</body></html>
