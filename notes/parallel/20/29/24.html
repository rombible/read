This is explained by what follows: <span class="cmt_word">He heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not</span>; better, <span class="accented">he heareth the adjuration</span>, <span class="accented">and telleth not</span>. This refers to the course of proceeding defined by <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, and intimated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-2.htm">Judges 17:2</a>. When a theft was committed, the person wronged or the judge pronounced an imprecation on the thief and on any one who was privy to the crime, and refrained from giving information; a witness who saw and knew of it, and was silent under this formal adjuration, has to bear his iniquity; he is not only an accomplice of a criminal, he is also a perjurer; one sin leads to another. Some commentators explain the first hemistich as referring only to the crime of receiving or using stolen goods, by which a man commits a crime and exposes himself to punishment; but it is best taken, as above, in connection with the second clause, and as elucidated thereby. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:19. Here is an unprofitable, slothful, wicked servant; one that serves not from conscience, or love, but from fear. 20. When a man is self-conceited, rash, and given to wrangling, there is more hope of the ignorant and profligate. 21. Good usage to a servant does not mean indulgence, which would ruin even a child. The body is a servant to the soul; those that humour it, and are over-tender of it, will find it forget its place. 22. An angry, passionate disposition makes men provoking to one another, and provoking to God. 23. Only those who humble themselves shall be exalted and established. 24. The receiver is as bad as the thief. 25. Many are ashamed to own Christ now; and he will not own them in the day of judgment. But he that trusts in the Lord will be saved from this snare.</body></html>
