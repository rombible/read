These are the persons who raise rebellion in a country and excite opposition to constituted authority. The rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>, "bring into a snare," as in the Authorized Version, is supported by some of the Jewish versions and commentaries; but the more correct rendering is "blow into a blaze, inflame," as the Revised Version (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20, 21</a>). These scorners excite the populace to acts of fury, when all respect for piety and virtue is lost; they fan the passions of the fickle people, and lead them to civil discord and dangerous excesses (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-10.htm">Proverbs 22:10</a>). Septuagint, "Lawless men burn up a city." <span class="cmt_word">But wise men turn away wrath;</span> by their prudent counsels allay the angry passions roused by those evil men (see Ver. 11 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1, 18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1 If God wounds, who can heal? The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ. 2. The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked. 3. Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts. 4. The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people. 5. Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct. 6. Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety. 7. This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked. 8. The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God. 9. If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done. 10. Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men. The just, whom the blood-thirsty hate, gladly do any thing for their salvation.</body></html>
