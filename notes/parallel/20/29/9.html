or, the sense may be, "the fool rages and laughs;" he will not listen quietly to argument, by which he might be brought to wisdom, but is either violent or supercilious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man</span> - if a wise man has a controversy, either legal or social, with a wicked fool - <span class="cmt_word">whether he rage</span> (<span class="accented">is angry</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>or laugh,</span> <span class="cmt_word">there is no rest.</span> It is a question whether the wise man or the fool is the subject of this clause. St. Jerome makes the former the subject, <span class="accented">Vir sapiens</span>, <span class="accented">si cum stulto contenderit</span>, <span class="accented">sive irascatur</span>, <span class="accented">sive rideat</span>, <span class="accented">non inveniet requiem</span>. It matters not how the wise man treats the fool; he may be stern and angry, he may be gentle and good tempered, yet the fool will be none the better, will not be reformed, will not cease from his folly, will carry on his cavilling contention. Hitzig, Delitzsch, and others, deeming that the rage and the laughter are not becoming to the character of the wise man, take the fool as the subject; so that the sense is, that after all has been said, the fool only falls into a passion or laughs at the matter, argument is wasted upon him, and the controversy is never settled. This seems to be the best interpretation, and is somewhat supported by the Septuagint, "A wise man shall judge the nations, but a worthless man, being angry, laughs and fears not [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, which may also mean, 'is derided and terrifies no one']." Wordsworth notes that the irreligious fool is won neither by the austere preaching of John the Baptist nor by the mild teaching of Christ, but rejects both (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16-19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1 If God wounds, who can heal? The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ. 2. The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked. 3. Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts. 4. The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people. 5. Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct. 6. Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety. 7. This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked. 8. The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God. 9. If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done. 10. Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men. The just, whom the blood-thirsty hate, gladly do any thing for their salvation.</body></html>
