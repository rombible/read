The word "abomination" (<span class="accented">toebah</span>) occurs more than twenty times in the Proverbs; it is appropriate here because the good man looks upon the sinner as the enemy of God, as the psalmist says, "Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them thine enemies" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-21.htm">Psalm 139:21</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked;</span> because he is a standing reproach to him, and by every tone and look and action seems to express his condemnation (see on Proverbs 21:15, and the Septuagint Version there; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-34.htm">Matthew 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>). Septuagint, "A direct way is an abomination to the lawless." The Vulgate ends the chapter with a paragraph which is found in some manuscripts of the Septuagint after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22</a> (where see note), <span class="accented">Verbum custodiens filius extra perditionem erit</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:26. The wisest course is, to look to God, and seek the favour of the Ruler of rulers; for every creature is that to us which God makes it to be. 27. The just man abhors the sins of the wicked, and shuns their company. Christ exposed the wickedness of men, yet prayed for the wicked when they were crucifying him. Hatred to sin in ourselves and others, is a needful branch of the Christian temper. But all that are unholy, have rooted hatred to godliness.</body></html>
