"Vision" (<span class="accented">chazon</span>), prophecy in its widest sense, denotes the revelation of God's will made through agents, which directed the course of events, and was intended to be coordinate with the supreme secular authority. The prophets were the instructors of the people in Divine things, standing witnesses of the truth and power of religion, teaching a higher than mere human morality. The fatal effect of the absence of such revelation of God's will is stated to be confusion, disorder, and rebellion; the people, uncontrolled, fall into grievous excesses, which nothing but high principles can restrain. We note the licence of Eli's time, when there was no open vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a>.); in Asa's days, when Israel had long been without a teaching priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>); and when the impious Ahaz "made Judah naked" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19</a>); or when the people were destroyed by reason of lack of knowledge of Divine things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). Thus the importance of prophecy in regulating the life and religion of the people is fully acknowledged by the writer, in whose time, doubtless, the prophetical office was in full exercise: but this seems to be the only passage in the book where such teaching is directly mentioned; the instructors and preceptors elsewhere introduced as disseminating the principles of the <span class="accented">chochmah</span> being parents, or tutors, or professors, not inspired prophets. <span class="cmt_word">But he that keepeth the Law, happy is he!</span> "The Law" (<span class="accented">torah</span>) is not merely the written Mosaic Law, but the announcement of God's will by the mouth of his representatives; and the thought is, not the blessedness of those who in a time of anarchy and irreligion keep to the authorized enactments of the Sinaitic legislation, but a contrast between the lawlessness and ruin of a people uninfluenced by religious guidance, and the happy state of those who obey alike the voice of God, whether conveyed in written statutes or by the teaching of living prophets. (For "happy is he," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>.)

He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel. 12. One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his servants to become liars and false accusers. 13. Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. 14. The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for. 15. Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence. 16. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience. 17. Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss. 18. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! That gospel is an open vision, which holds forth Christ, which humbles the sinner and exalts the Saviour, which promotes holiness in the life and conversation: and these are precious truths to keep the soul alive, and prevent it from perishing.</body></html>
