"Magues amoris est amor." They who love virtue and wisdom are regarded with favour by God. whoso inspiration they have obeyed, obtaining grace for grace. So Ben Sira says, "Them that love her the Lord doth love "(Ecclus. 4:14); so Wisd. 7:28, "God loveth none but him that dwelleth with Wisdom." The Septuagint changes the verbs in this clause, though they are parts of the same word in the Hebrew: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;</span>. This reminds one of the passage in the last chapter of St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). where a similar interchange is made. <span class="cmt_word">Those that seek me early shall find me</span> (see the contrast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>). "Early" may mean from tender years; but more probably it is equivalent to "earnestly," "strenuously," as people deeply interested in any pursuit rise betimes to set about the necessary work (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>). The Septuagint, "They who seek (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) me shall find." So the Lord says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>), "Seek (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), and ye shall find;" Ecclus. 4:12, "He that loveth her loveth life; and they that seek to her early (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) shall be filled with joy" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-38.htm">Luke 21:38</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:12-21 Wisdom, here is Christ, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; it is Christ in the word, and Christ in the heart; not only Christ revealed to us, but Christ revealed in us. All prudence and skill are from the Lord. Through the redemption of Christ's precious blood, the riches of his grace abound in all wisdom and prudence. Man found out many inventions for ruin; God found one for our recovery. He hates pride and arrogance, evil ways and froward conversation; these render men unwilling to hear his humbling, awakening, holy instructions. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps to make their way plain. His wisdom makes all truly happy who receive it in the love of Christ Jesus. Seek him early, seek him earnestly, seek him before any thing else. Christ never said, Seek in vain. Those who love Christ, are such as have seen his loveliness, and have had his love shed abroad in their hearts; therefore they are happy. They shall be happy in this world, or in that which is beyond compare better. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished, but that which is well got, will wear well; and that which is well spent upon works of piety and charity, will be lasting. If they have not riches and honour in this world, they shall have that which is infinitely better. They shall be happy in the grace of God. Christ, by his Spirit, guides believers into all truth, and so leads them in the way of righteousness; and they walk after the Spirit. Also, they shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter. In Wisdom's promises, believers have goods laid up, not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better than gold.</body></html>
