It is questioned <span class="accented">where</span> the mountains were supposed to be fixed, and some have thought that they are represented as fixed in the depths of the earth. But, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, they are regarded as rising from the waters, their foundations are laid in the great deep. So the psalmist, speaking of the waters, says, "They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hast founded for them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>). What is here affirmed of Wisdom is said of Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth, nor the fields</span>. The distinction intended is land as cultivated and occupied by buildings, etc., and waste uncultivated land outside towns. Septuagint, "The Lord made countries and uninhabited places (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Adhuc terram non fecerat, et flumina.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">chutsoth</span>; things without, abroad, hence open country. The Vulgate rendering, and that of Aquila and Symmaehus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, are plainly erroneous, as waters have already been mentioned (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">The highest part of the dust of the world;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the head of the dusts of the world.</span> Some have interpreted this expression of "man," the chief of those creatures which are made of the dust of the ground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>). But the idea comes in awkwardly here; it is not natural to introduce man amid the inanimate works of nature, or to use such an enigmatical designation for him. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">cardines orbis terrarum</span>, "the world's hinges;" Septuagint, "the inhabited summits of the earth beneath the heavens; according to St. Hilary ('De Trinit.,' 12), "cacumina quae habitantur sub coelo." Others take the term to signify the capes or promontories ot the world, the peaks and elevations; others, the clods of dry, amble land, in contrast to the untilled waste of waters; others, the chief elements, the matter of which the earth is composed. This last interpretation would lead us back to a period which has already been passed. Amid the many possible explanations, it is perhaps best (with Delitzsch, Nowack, etc.) to take <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "head" as equivalent to "sum," "mass," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>. "How great is the sum (<span class="accented">rosh</span>) of them!" Then the expression comprehensively means all the mass of earth's dust. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-31 The Son of God declares himself to have been engaged in the creation of the world. How able, how fit is the Son of God to be the Saviour of the world, who was the Creator of it! The Son of God was ordained, before the world, to that great work. Does he delight in saving wretched sinners, and shall not we delight in his salvation?</body></html>
