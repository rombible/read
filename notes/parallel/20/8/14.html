The Vulgate has <span class="accented">aequitas</span>; the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "safety." The word occurs elsewhere in this book and in Job, but only in two other places of Scripture, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>. It means properly "elevation" or "furtherance," or, as others say, "substance;" and then that which is essentially good end useful, which may be wisdom, aid, or security (see on Proverbs 2:7). Wisdom affirms that she possesses counsel and all that can help forward righteousness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13, 16</a>, passages very similar to the present (comp. Wisd. 8:9, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I am understanding.</span> Wisdom does not merely possess these attributes; they are her very nature, as it is said, "God is love" St. Jerome's <span class="accented">mea est prudentia</span>, and the LXX.'s <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, lose this trait. <span class="cmt_word">I have strength.</span> Wisdom directs the energies and powers of her pupils, which without her control would be spent wrongly or uselessly (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>). Wisdom, understanding, and might are named among the seven gifts of the Spirit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>; and we may see in the passage generally an adumbration of him who is called "Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:12-21 Wisdom, here is Christ, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; it is Christ in the word, and Christ in the heart; not only Christ revealed to us, but Christ revealed in us. All prudence and skill are from the Lord. Through the redemption of Christ's precious blood, the riches of his grace abound in all wisdom and prudence. Man found out many inventions for ruin; God found one for our recovery. He hates pride and arrogance, evil ways and froward conversation; these render men unwilling to hear his humbling, awakening, holy instructions. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps to make their way plain. His wisdom makes all truly happy who receive it in the love of Christ Jesus. Seek him early, seek him earnestly, seek him before any thing else. Christ never said, Seek in vain. Those who love Christ, are such as have seen his loveliness, and have had his love shed abroad in their hearts; therefore they are happy. They shall be happy in this world, or in that which is beyond compare better. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished, but that which is well got, will wear well; and that which is well spent upon works of piety and charity, will be lasting. If they have not riches and honour in this world, they shall have that which is infinitely better. They shall be happy in the grace of God. Christ, by his Spirit, guides believers into all truth, and so leads them in the way of righteousness; and they walk after the Spirit. Also, they shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter. In Wisdom's promises, believers have goods laid up, not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better than gold.</body></html>
