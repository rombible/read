A similar promise is made at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16, 18, 22</a>. The truth here enunciated is also spoken or the Word of God, the everlasting Son of the Father. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>, "In him was life; and the life was the light of men;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>, "He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, "This is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm">John 8:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>; Ecclus. 4:12). <span class="cmt_word">Shall obtain favour of the Lord;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">hauriet salutem</span>, which happily renders the Hebrew verb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>). The grace of God bringeth salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>). Septuagint, "For my outgoings (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are the outgoings of life, and the will is prepared by the Lord (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." This latter clause was used by the Fathers, especially in the Pelagian controversy, to prove the necessity of prevenient grace (see St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' 2:32; 'De Gratia,' 6:16, 17). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:32-36 Surely we should hearken to Christ's voice with the readiness of children. Let us all be wise, and not refuse such mercy. Blessed are those who hear the Saviour's voice, and wait on him with daily reading, meditation, and prayer. The children of the world find time for vain amusements, without neglecting what they deem the one thing needful. Does it not show contempt of Wisdom's instructions, when people professing godliness, seek excuses for neglecting the means of grace? Christ is Wisdom, and he is Life to all believers; nor can we obtain God's favour, unless we find Christ, and are found in him. Those who offend Christ deceive themselves; sin is a wrong to the soul. Sinners die because they will die, which justifies God when he judges.</body></html>
