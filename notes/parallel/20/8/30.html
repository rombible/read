whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.">Esther 2:7</a>). But the word may also bear the sense of "artificer." It probably occurs in this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.">Jeremiah 52:15</a> (though translated "multitude," in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm" title="Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.">2Kings 25:11</a>), and in a slightly different form, <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-1.htm" title="How beautiful are your feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.">Song of Solomon 7:1</a>.

So <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-2.htm">John 1:2</a>, "The Word was with God." <span class="cmt_word">As one brought up with him;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">cuncta componens</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "I was with him arranging things in harmony." The Hebrew word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">amon</span>), "an artificer," "workman" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>). Thus in Wisd. 7:22 Wisdom is called <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the worker of all things." The Authorized Version takes the word in a passive state, as equivalent to <span class="accented">alumnus</span>, "foster child." and this interpretation is etymologically admissible, and may possibly, as Schultens suggests, be glanced at in St. John's expression (John 1:18), "the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father." But as the point here is the creative energy of Wisdom, it is best to take the term as denoting "artificer." It will then accord with the expression <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, applied by the Fathers to the Word of God, by whom all things were made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, Textus Receptus, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I was daily his delight;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I was delights day by day</span>, which may mean either as in Authorized Version, or "I had delight continually," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it may signify <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either that God took pleasure in the wisdom which displayed his workmanship, saw that it was very good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a>, etc.), looked with delight on the beloved Son in whom he was well pleased (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may mean that Wisdom herself rejoiced in her power and her work, rejoiced in giving effect to the Creator's idea, and so "founding the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">delectabar per singulos dies.</span> The Septuagint adopts the former of these views, "I was that wherein he took delight." But the second interpretation seems most suitable, as the paragraph is stating rather what Wisdom is in herself than what she was in the eyes of Jehovah. What follows is a parallel. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoicing always before him;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">ludens coram eo omni tempore</span>, as though the work of creation was a sport and pastime of a happy holiday. The expression is meant to denote the ease with which the operations were performed, and the pleasure which their execution yielded. David uses the same word, speaking of his dancing before the ark, when he says. "Therefore will I play before the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-21.htm">2 Samuel 6:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-23.htm">Proverbs 10:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-31 The Son of God declares himself to have been engaged in the creation of the world. How able, how fit is the Son of God to be the Saviour of the world, who was the Creator of it! The Son of God was ordained, before the world, to that great work. Does he delight in saving wretched sinners, and shall not we delight in his salvation?</body></html>
