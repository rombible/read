It is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>(<span class="accented">nasak</span>), in niph.; and it is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>, "I have set my King upon my holy hill." Both here and there it has been translated "anointed," which would make a noteworthy reference to Christ. But there seems no proof that the word has this meaning. It signifies properly "to pour forth" (as of molten metal), then "to put down," "to appoint or establish." The versions recognize this. Thus the Septuagint, "he established (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) me;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ordinata sum</span>; Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>; Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (comp. Ecclus. 1:9). So what is here said is that Wisdom was from everlasting exalted as ruler and disposer of all things. To express eternal relation, three synonymous terms are used. From <span class="accented">everlasting</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint, as Delitzsch notes, points back to infinite distance. <span class="cmt_word">From the beginning;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before the world was begun to be made; as St. John says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>), "In the beginning was the Word;" and Christ prays, "Glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Or ever the earth was</span>. This looks to the most remote time after the actual creation, while the earth was being formed and adapted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-31 The Son of God declares himself to have been engaged in the creation of the world. How able, how fit is the Son of God to be the Saviour of the world, who was the Creator of it! The Son of God was ordained, before the world, to that great work. Does he delight in saving wretched sinners, and shall not we delight in his salvation?</body></html>
