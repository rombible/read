And the truth stated is obvious - he who refuses to obey Wisdom, and transgresses her wholesome rules, will smart for it. Every sin involves punishment, injures the spiritual life, and demands satisfaction. But Delitzsch and others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, "my sinning one," "my sinner," in the older sense of "missing," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a>, the derived meaning of "sinning" springing naturally from the idea of deviating from the right way or failing to hit the mark. So here the translation will be "he who misseth me," which is a good contrast to "whoso findeth me," of ver. 35. He who takes a path which does not lead to wisdom is guilty of moral suicide. <span class="cmt_word">All that hate me love death</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>). "He that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>). They who will not hearken to Wisdom, and who scorn her counsels, do virtually love death, because they love the things and the practices which lead to death, temporal and spiritual <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>, "They that sin are enemies to their own life" (comp. Wisd. 1:12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:32-36 Surely we should hearken to Christ's voice with the readiness of children. Let us all be wise, and not refuse such mercy. Blessed are those who hear the Saviour's voice, and wait on him with daily reading, meditation, and prayer. The children of the world find time for vain amusements, without neglecting what they deem the one thing needful. Does it not show contempt of Wisdom's instructions, when people professing godliness, seek excuses for neglecting the means of grace? Christ is Wisdom, and he is Life to all believers; nor can we obtain God's favour, unless we find Christ, and are found in him. Those who offend Christ deceive themselves; sin is a wrong to the soul. Sinners die because they will die, which justifies God when he judges.</body></html>
