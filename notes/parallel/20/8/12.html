So the Lord is said to "inhabit eternity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>). Septuagint, "I wisdom dwelt (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) in counsel and knowledge," which recalls, "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) among us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a> we find the expression, "Who alone hath (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) immortality," exchanged with the phrase, "Who dwelleth (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) in the unapproachable light." <span class="cmt_word">And find out knowledge of witty inventions</span>. This rendering refers to the production and solution of dark sayings which Wisdom effects. But the expression is better rendered, "knowledge of deeds of discretion" (ch. 1:4), or "of right counsels," and it signifies that Wisdom presides over all well considered designs, that they are not beyond her sphere, and that she has and uses the knowledge of them. Septuagint, "I (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>) called upon understanding," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is I who inspire all good and righteous thought. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:12-21 Wisdom, here is Christ, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; it is Christ in the word, and Christ in the heart; not only Christ revealed to us, but Christ revealed in us. All prudence and skill are from the Lord. Through the redemption of Christ's precious blood, the riches of his grace abound in all wisdom and prudence. Man found out many inventions for ruin; God found one for our recovery. He hates pride and arrogance, evil ways and froward conversation; these render men unwilling to hear his humbling, awakening, holy instructions. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps to make their way plain. His wisdom makes all truly happy who receive it in the love of Christ Jesus. Seek him early, seek him earnestly, seek him before any thing else. Christ never said, Seek in vain. Those who love Christ, are such as have seen his loveliness, and have had his love shed abroad in their hearts; therefore they are happy. They shall be happy in this world, or in that which is beyond compare better. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished, but that which is well got, will wear well; and that which is well spent upon works of piety and charity, will be lasting. If they have not riches and honour in this world, they shall have that which is infinitely better. They shall be happy in the grace of God. Christ, by his Spirit, guides believers into all truth, and so leads them in the way of righteousness; and they walk after the Spirit. Also, they shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter. In Wisdom's promises, believers have goods laid up, not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better than gold.</body></html>
