(Comp. St. Paul's advice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a>.) It was out of a merciful remembrance of this passage that the pious ladies of Jerusalem used to provide a medicated drink for criminals condemned to be crucified, in order to deaden their pain. This was offered to our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm" title="They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.">Matthew 27:34</a>), but He would not drink it, as He wished to keep His mind clear to the last, and was willing to drink to the dregs the "cup which His Father had given Him."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - There are cases where strong drink may be properly administered. <span class="cmt_word">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19</a>). As a restorative, a cordial, or a medicine, wine may he advantageously used; it has a place in the providential economy of God. "Use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities," was St. Paul's advice to Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>). It is supposed to have been in consideration of the injunction in the text that the ladies of Jerusalem provided for criminals on their way to the place of execution a drink of medicated wine, which might deaden the pain of suffering. This was the draught rejected by Christ, who willed to taste the full bitterness of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23</a>). The Septuagint has, "to those that are in sorrow;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">maerentibus</span>, but this makes the two clauses tautological. <span class="cmt_word">Wine unto those that be of heavy hearts</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20</a>). "Wine," says the psalmist, "maketh glad the heart of man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). Says Homer, 'Iliad,' 6:261 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Great is the strength <br />Which generous wine imparts to wearied men."</span> Wine, says St. Chrysostom ('Hom. in Ephes.,' 19), "has been given us for cheerfulness, not for drunkenness. Wouldest thou know where wine is good? Hear what the Scripture saith, 'Give wine to them, etc. And justly, because it can mitigate asperity and gloominess, and drive away clouds from the brow" (comp. Ecclus. 34 [31]:25, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-9 When children are under the mother's eye, she has an opportunity of fashioning their minds aright. Those who are grown up, should often call to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.</body></html>
