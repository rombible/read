"Lemuel," which most likely signifies (dedicated) "to God," has been, like Agur, supposed to be a designation of Solomon, but with no good reason.<p><span class= "bld">The prophecy that his mother taught him.--</span>Mothers were looked upon with great veneration in the East. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm" title="My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-20.htm" title="My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:">Proverbs 6:20</a>.) The mothers of kings especially were treated with marked respect, receiving the title of "queen-mother." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm" title="Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.">1Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1Kings 15:13</a>.) This seems to be the reason why the mothers of Jewish kings are so constantly mentioned, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-31.htm" title="And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

At the present time the mother of the Khedive ranks before his principal wife.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - Part VIII. SECOND APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION, containing "the words of Lemuel" on the subjects of impurity and intemperance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">superscription. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The words of King Lemuel, the prophecy which his mother taught him.</span> Who is intended by "Lemuel king" is much disputed. Those who connect the following word <span class="accented">massa</span> ("oracle") with the preceding <span class="accented">melek</span> ("king"), translate "King of Massa," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a> (where see note). Of the country, or the king, or his mother, we have absolutely no information. The name Lemuel, or Lemoel (ver. 4), means "unto God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dedicated to God, like Lael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-24.htm">Numbers 3:24</a>); hence it is regarded by many authorities, ancient and modern, as an appellation of Solomon, one from infancy dedicated to God and celled by him Jedidiah, "beloved of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>). But there is nothing in the contents of this section to confirm this idea; indeed, there are expressions which militate against it. Possibly Hezekiah may be meant, and his remarkable piety somewhat confirms the opinion; yet we see no reason why he should be here addressed under a pseudonym, especially if we consider that he himself was concerned in making this collection. On the whole, it seems best to take Lemuel as a symbolical name, designating an ideal king, to whom an ideal mother addressed the exhortation which follows. Solomon's own proverbs contain many warnings against the very sins of which this mother speaks, so that the section is conceived in the spirit of the earlier portion of the book, though it is assigned to a different author and another age. <span class="accented">The prophecy</span> (<span class="accented">massa</span>); the inspired utterance (see on ch. 30:1). This maternal counsel forms one compact exhortation, which might with more propriety be so termed than the words of Agur. <span class="accented">His mother.</span> The mother of a reigning king was always regarded with the utmost respect, taking precedence of the king's wife. Hence we so often find the names of kings' mothers in the sacred record; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>. It is difficult to say what reading was seen by the LXX., who render, "My words have been spoken by God, the oracle of a king whom his mother instructed." There are many wise women mentioned in Scripture; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Miriam, Deborah, the Queen of Sheba, Huldah, etc., so there is nothing incongruous in Lemuel being instructed by his mother in wisdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-9 When children are under the mother's eye, she has an opportunity of fashioning their minds aright. Those who are grown up, should often call to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.</body></html>
