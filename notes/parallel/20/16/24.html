"Pleasant words" are words of comforting, soothing tendency, as in ch. 15:26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>. The writer continues his praise of apt speech. The comparison with honey is common in all languages and at all times. Thus Homer sings of Nestor ('Iliad,' 1:248, etc.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The smooth-tongued chief, from whose persuasive lips<br />Sweeter than honey flowed the stream of speech."<br /><br />(Derby.)</span> So the story goes that on the lips of St. Ambrose, while still a boy, a swarm of bees settled, portending his future persuasive eloquence. Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>). The verse forms one sentence. The happy results of pleasant words are felt in body and soul. Honey in Palestine is a staple article of food, and is also used as a medicinal remedy. Of its reviving effects we read in the case of Jonathan, who from a little portion hurriedly taken as he marched on had "his eyes enlightened" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>). Septuagint, "Their sweetness is the healing of the soul." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Speech the physician of the soul's annoy."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:12. The ruler that uses his power aright, will find that to be his best security. 13. Put those in power who know how to speak to the purpose. 14,15. Those are fools, who, to obtain the favour of an earthly prince, throw themselves out of God's favour. 16. There is joy and satisfaction of spirit, only in getting wisdom. 17. A sincerely religious man keeps at a distance from every appearance of evil. Happy is the man that walks in Christ, and is led by the Spirit of Christ. 18. When men defy God's judgments, and think themselves far from them, it is a sign they are at the door. Let us not fear the pride of others, but fear pride in ourselves. 19. Humility, though it exposes to contempt in the world, is much better than high-spiritedness, which makes God an enemy. He that understands God's word shall find good. 21. The man whose wisdom dwells in his heart, will be found more truly prudent than many who possess shining talents. 22. As waters to a thirsty land, so is a wise man to his friends and neighbours. 23. The wise man's self-knowledge, always suggests something proper to be spoken to others. 24. The word of God cures the diseases that weaken our souls. 25. This is caution to all, to take heed of deceiving themselves as to their souls. 26. We must labour for the meat which endureth to everlasting life, or we must perish.</body></html>
