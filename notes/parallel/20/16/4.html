Or the passage may be translated, "hath made all for its own end or purpose." The assertion that "He has made the wicked for the day of evil," does not mean that He created any one for punishment--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>predestined him for destruction. It only teaches that even the wicked are subservient to God's eternal purposes; that Pharaoh, for instance, by his rebellion could not change God's plans for the deliverance of His people, but only gave Him an occasion for showing forth His power, justice, goodness, and longsuffering. The "day of evil," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>punishment, at last overtook Pharaoh in accordance with the law and purpose of God that the wicked, if unrepentant, shall be punished, and thereby serve as a warning to others; but God by his longsuffering shewed that He was "not willing" that he should "perish," but rather that he "should come to repentance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2Peter 3:9</a>). This appears to be also the teaching of St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm" title="For the scripture said to Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.">Romans 9:17</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath made all things for himself</span>. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">propter semetipsum</span>; and Origen ('Praef. in Job'), <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. That is, God hath made everything for his own purpose, to answer the design which he hath intended from all eternity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>). But this translation is not in accordance with the present reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which means rather "for its own end," for its own proper use. Everything in God's design has its own end and object and reason for being where it is and such as it is; everything exhibits his goodness and wisdom, and tends to his glory. Septuagint, "All the works of the Lord are with righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span> This clause has been perverted to support the terrible doctrine of reprobation - that God, whose will must be always efficacious, has willed the damnation of some; whereas we are taught that God's will is that "all men should be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth," and that "God sent his Son not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). Man, having freewill, can reject this gracious purpose of God, and render the means of salvation nugatory; but this does not make God the cause of man's destruction, but man himself. In saying that God "made the wicked," the writer does not mean that God made him as such, but made him as he made all other things, giving him powers and capacities which he might have used to good, but which, as a fact, he uses to evil. It will be useful here to quote the wise words of St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 6:33), "The Just and Merciful One, as he disposes the deeds of mortals, vouchsafes some things in mercy, and permits other things in anger; and the things which he permits he so bears with that he turns them to the account of his purpose. And hence it is brought to pass in a marvellous way that even that which is done without t,e will of God is not contrary to the will of God. For while evil deeds are converted to a good use, the very things that oppose his design render service to his design." <span class="accented">The day of evil</span> is the hour of punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>), which by a moral law will inevitably fall upon the sinner. God makes man's wickedness subserve his purposes and manifest his glory, as we see in the case of Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>), and the crucifixion of our blessed Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>). It is a phase of God's moral government that an evil day should be appointed for transgressors, and it is from foreknowledge of their deserts that their punishment is prepared. The perplexing question, why God allows men to come into the world whom he knows will meet with perdition, is not handled here. Septuagint, "But the impious is kept for an evil day." Cato, 'Dist.,' 2:8 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nolo putes pravos homines peccata lucrari:<br />Temporibus peccata latent, sed tempore patent."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:4. God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11. To observe justice in dealings between man and man is God's appointment.</body></html>
