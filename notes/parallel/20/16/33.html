(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-29.htm" title="Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.">Matthew 10:29-30</a>.) This should be an encouragement to trust in Him.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lot is cast into the lap.</span> The bosom or fold of the garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>). It is not quite clear what articles the Jews used in their divinations by lot. Probably they employed stones, differing in shape or colour, or having some distinguishing mark. These were placed in a vessel or in the fold of a garment, and drawn or shaken thence. Such a practice has been common in all ages and countries; and though only cursorily mentioned in the Mosaic legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>), it was used by the Jews from the time of Joshua, and in the earliest days of the Christian Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>:28, etc.). As by this means man's agency was minimized, and all partiality and chicanery were excluded, the decision was regarded as directed by Providence. There is one case only of ordeal in the Law, and that under suspicion of adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12</a>, etc.). In the Epistle to the Hebrews, in place of the lot we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>), "An oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife." <span class="cmt_word">The whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</span> In these cases the Jew learned to see, in what we call chance, the overruling of Divine power. But this was not blind superstition. He did not feel justified in resorting to this practice on every trivial occasion, as persons used the <span class="accented">Sortes Virgilianae</span> or even the verses of the Bible for the same purpose. The lot was employed religiously in cases where other means of decision were not suitable or available; it was not to supersede common prudence or careful investigation; but, for example, in trials where the evidence was conflicting and the judges could not determine the case, the merits were ascer-rained by lot (comp. ch. 18:18). After the effusion of the Holy Spirit, the apostles never resorted to divination, and the Christian Church has wisely repudiated the practice of all such modes of discovering the Divine will. Septuagint, "For the unrighteous all things fall into their bosom, but from the Lord are all just things," which may mean either that, though the wicked seem to prosper, God still works out his righteous ends; or the evil suffer retribution, and thus God's justice is displayed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:27,28. Ungodly men bestow more pains to do mischief than would be needful to do good. The whisperer separates friends: what a hateful, but how common a character! 29,30. Some do all the mischief they can by force and violence, and are blind to the result. 31. Old people especially should be found in the way of religion and godliness. 32. To overcome our own passions, requires more steady management, than obtaining victory over an enemy. 33. All the disposal of Providence concerning our affairs, we must look upon to be the determining what we referred to God; and we must be reconciled to them accordingly. Blessed are those that give themselves up to the will of God; for he knows what is good for them.</body></html>
