The second member is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>, and must be taken as a form of adjuration. Septuagint, "Putting hands on hand unjustly, he shall not be innocent;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who acts violently and unjustly shall be held guilty - which seems a trite truism. Many commentators interpret the clause as if it meant that the cooperation and combination of sinners in evil practices will not save them from retribution. But hand clasping hand in token of completing a bargain or alliance is scarcely an early Oriental custom. There is an analogous saying in Greek which implies mutual assistance - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Hand washes hand, and finger finger."</span> The LXX. has here two distiches, the first of which occurs in the Vulgate, but the second is not found there. Neither appears in our present Hebrew text. "The beginning of the good way is to do what is just; this is more acceptable to God than to sacrifice sacrifices. He who seeketh the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness; and they who seek him rightly alkali find peace." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:4. God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11. To observe justice in dealings between man and man is God's appointment.</body></html>
