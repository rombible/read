This verse recalls the days of Solomon's youth, when it was his highest aspiration to judge his people righteously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm" title="Give therefore your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your so great a people?">1Kings 3:9</a>).

Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The king's words have, in people's minds, the certainty and importance of a Divine oracle, putting an end to all controversy or division of opinion. It seems to be a general maxim, not especially referring to Solomon or the theocratic kingdom, but rather indicating the traditional view of the absolute monarchy. The custom of deifying kings and invoking them as gods was usual in Egypt and Eastern countries, and made its way to the West. "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man," cried the people, when Herod addressed them in the amphitheatre at Caesarea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>). The Greeks could say - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"God's very living image is the king."</span> And thus his utterances were regarded as irrefragably true and decisive. <span class="cmt_word">His month transgresseth not in judgment.</span> The decisions which he gives are infallible, and, at any rate, irresistible. We may refer to Solomon's famous verdict concerning the two mothers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>, etc.), and such sentences as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>, "By me (wisdom) kings reign, and princes decree justice" (see below on ver. 12; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>); and David's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>), "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God" (Wisd. 9:4, 10, 12). Delitzsch regards the second hemistich as giving a warning (consequent on the former clause), and not stating a fact, "In the judgment his mouth should not err." The present chapter contains many admonitions to kings which a wise father like Solomon may have uttered and recorded for the benefit of his son. If this is the case, it is as strange as it is true that Rehoboam made little use of the counsels, and that Solomon's latter days gave the lie to many of them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:4. God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11. To observe justice in dealings between man and man is God's appointment.</body></html>
