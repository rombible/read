Psalms 72 works out the thought more fully. How feebly the character was fulfilled by Solomon or the best of his successors the history of Israel shews. It was too high a conception for man to carry out, and was fulfilled only in the person of David's Son, who is "King of kings, and Lord of lords" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm" title="And he has on his clothing and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness.</span> This and the following verse give the ideal view of the monarch - that which he ought to be rather than what be is (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>.). Certainly neither Solomon nor many of his successors exhibited this high character. The Septuagint, followed by some modern commentators, translates, "He who doeth wickedness is an abomination to kings;" but as the "righteousness" in the second clause (<span class="cmt_word">the throne is established by righteousness</span>) undoubtedly refers to the king, so it is more natural to take the "wickedness" in the first member as being his own, not his subjects'. When a ruler acts justly and wisely, punishes the unruly, rewards the virtuous, acts as God's vicegerent, and himself sets the example of the character which becomes so high a position, he wins the affection of his people, they willingly obey him. and are ready to die for him and his family (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>). Lawmakers should not be law breakers. Seneca, 'Thyest.,' 215 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ubi non est pudor,<br />Nec cura juris, sanctitas, pietas, fides,<br />Instabile regnum est."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:12. The ruler that uses his power aright, will find that to be his best security. 13. Put those in power who know how to speak to the purpose. 14,15. Those are fools, who, to obtain the favour of an earthly prince, throw themselves out of God's favour. 16. There is joy and satisfaction of spirit, only in getting wisdom. 17. A sincerely religious man keeps at a distance from every appearance of evil. Happy is the man that walks in Christ, and is led by the Spirit of Christ. 18. When men defy God's judgments, and think themselves far from them, it is a sign they are at the door. Let us not fear the pride of others, but fear pride in ourselves. 19. Humility, though it exposes to contempt in the world, is much better than high-spiritedness, which makes God an enemy. He that understands God's word shall find good. 21. The man whose wisdom dwells in his heart, will be found more truly prudent than many who possess shining talents. 22. As waters to a thirsty land, so is a wise man to his friends and neighbours. 23. The wise man's self-knowledge, always suggests something proper to be spoken to others. 24. The word of God cures the diseases that weaken our souls. 25. This is caution to all, to take heed of deceiving themselves as to their souls. 26. We must labour for the meat which endureth to everlasting life, or we must perish.</body></html>
