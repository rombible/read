The great principles of truth end justice govern all the transactions of buying and selling; religion enters into the business of trading, and weights and measures are sacred things. Vulgate, "The weights and the balance are judgments of the Lord;" being true and fair, they are regarded as God's judgment. Septuagint, "The turn of the balance is justice before God." <span class="cmt_word">All the weights of the bag are his work.</span> Some have round a difficulty here, because the bag may contain false as well as true weights (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>), and it could not be said that the light weights were the Lord's work. This surely is captious criticism. The maxim merely states that the trader's weights take their origin and authority from God's enactment, from certain eternal principles which he has established. What man's chicanery and fraud make of them does not come into view. (For the law that regulates such matters, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a>, etc.) That cheating in this respect was not uncommon we learn from the complaints of the prophets, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>. The religious character of the standard weights and measures is shown by the term "shekel of the sanctuary" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>, and elsewhere continually). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:4. God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11. To observe justice in dealings between man and man is God's appointment.</body></html>
