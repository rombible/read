Says the Latin gnome - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Largitor artium, ingeniique magister Venter."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The belly is the teacher of all arts,<br />The parent of invention."</span> De tout s'avise a qui pain faut, "He who wants bread thinks of everything." There is our own homely saw, "Need makes the old wife trot;" as the Italians say, "Hunger sets the dog a-hunting" (Kelly). <span class="cmt_word">For his mouth craveth it of him;</span> his mouth must have food to put in it. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">akaph</span>) does not occur elsewhere; it means properly "to bend," and then to put a load on, to constrain to press. So here, "His mouth bends over him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> urgeth him thereto" (Revised Version). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7</a>, "All labour of man is for his mouth;" we should say stomach. Hunger in some sense is the great stimulus of all work. "We commanded you," says St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>), "that if any would not work, neither should he eat." There is a spiritual hunger without which grace cannot be sought or obtained - that hungering and thirsting after righteousness of which Christ speaks, and which he who is the Bread of life is ready to satisfy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-58.htm">John 6:58</a>). The Septuagint expands the maxim: "A man in labours labours for himself, and drives away (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) his own destruction; but the perverse man upon his own mouth carrieth destruction." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:12. The ruler that uses his power aright, will find that to be his best security. 13. Put those in power who know how to speak to the purpose. 14,15. Those are fools, who, to obtain the favour of an earthly prince, throw themselves out of God's favour. 16. There is joy and satisfaction of spirit, only in getting wisdom. 17. A sincerely religious man keeps at a distance from every appearance of evil. Happy is the man that walks in Christ, and is led by the Spirit of Christ. 18. When men defy God's judgments, and think themselves far from them, it is a sign they are at the door. Let us not fear the pride of others, but fear pride in ourselves. 19. Humility, though it exposes to contempt in the world, is much better than high-spiritedness, which makes God an enemy. He that understands God's word shall find good. 21. The man whose wisdom dwells in his heart, will be found more truly prudent than many who possess shining talents. 22. As waters to a thirsty land, so is a wise man to his friends and neighbours. 23. The wise man's self-knowledge, always suggests something proper to be spoken to others. 24. The word of God cures the diseases that weaken our souls. 25. This is caution to all, to take heed of deceiving themselves as to their souls. 26. We must labour for the meat which endureth to everlasting life, or we must perish.</body></html>
