It is by the exercise of those graces, not by mere external rites, that God is propitiated (see on Proverbs 10:2). A kind of expiatory value is assigned to these virtues, which, indeed, must not be pressed too closely, but should be examined by the light of such passages in the New Testament as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-41.htm">Luke 11:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>. Of course, such graces show themselves only in one who is really devout and God fearing; they are the fruits of a heart at peace with God and man, and react on the character and conduct. The LXX., which places this distich after ver. 27 of ch. 15, translates, "By alms and faithfulness (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) sins are cleansed," confining the term "mercy" to one special form, as in one reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6</a>. l, "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness [<span class="accented">al.</span> alms] before men." <span class="cmt_word">By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</span> The practice of true religion, of course, involves abstinence from sin; and this seems so unnecessary a truth to be formally stated that some take the "evil" named to be physical, not moral evil; calamity, not transgression. But the two clauses are coordinate, and present two aspects of the same truth. The first intimates how sin is to be expiated, the second how it is to be avoided. The morally good man meets with pardon and acceptance, and he who fears God is delivered from evil. So we pray, in the Lord's Prayer, "Forgive us our trespasses, and deliver us from evil." Septuagint, "By the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:4. God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11. To observe justice in dealings between man and man is God's appointment.</body></html>
