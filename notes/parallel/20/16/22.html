Or it may mean, "the discipline which fools have to endure is folly." If they will not be taught by wisdom, their own folly will serve as a rod to correct them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Understanding is a well spring of life unto him that hath it</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>). The possessor of understanding has in himself a source of comfort and a vivifying power, which is as refreshing as a cool spring to a thirsty traveller. In all troubles and difficulties he can fall back upon his own good sense and prudence, and satisfy himself therewith. This is not conceit, but the result of a well grounded experience. <span class="cmt_word">But the instruction of fools is folly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the instruction which fools give is folly and sin; such is the only teaching which they can offer. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">doctrina stultorum fatuitas</span>; and many modern commentators. But <span class="accented">musar</span> is better taken in the sense of "discipline" or "chastisement" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-5.htm">Proverbs 15:5</a>), which the bad man suffers. His own folly is the scourge which punishes him; refusing the teaching of wisdom, he makes misery for himself, deprives himself of the happiness which virtue gives, and pierces himself through with many sorrows. Septuagint, "The instruction of tools is evil." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:12. The ruler that uses his power aright, will find that to be his best security. 13. Put those in power who know how to speak to the purpose. 14,15. Those are fools, who, to obtain the favour of an earthly prince, throw themselves out of God's favour. 16. There is joy and satisfaction of spirit, only in getting wisdom. 17. A sincerely religious man keeps at a distance from every appearance of evil. Happy is the man that walks in Christ, and is led by the Spirit of Christ. 18. When men defy God's judgments, and think themselves far from them, it is a sign they are at the door. Let us not fear the pride of others, but fear pride in ourselves. 19. Humility, though it exposes to contempt in the world, is much better than high-spiritedness, which makes God an enemy. He that understands God's word shall find good. 21. The man whose wisdom dwells in his heart, will be found more truly prudent than many who possess shining talents. 22. As waters to a thirsty land, so is a wise man to his friends and neighbours. 23. The wise man's self-knowledge, always suggests something proper to be spoken to others. 24. The word of God cures the diseases that weaken our souls. 25. This is caution to all, to take heed of deceiving themselves as to their souls. 26. We must labour for the meat which endureth to everlasting life, or we must perish.</body></html>
