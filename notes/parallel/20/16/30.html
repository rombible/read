From such a crafty, malignant man you need not expect any more open tokens of his intentions. <span class="cmt_word">He shutteth his eyes</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>); either that he may better think out his evil plans, or else he cannot look his neighbour in the face while he is plotting against him. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">attonitis oculis</span>; Septuagint, "fixing (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) his eyes." <span class="cmt_word">Moving his lips;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he who compresseth his lips</span>, to hide the malignant smile with which he might greet his neighbour's calamity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>, etc.; Proverbs 10:10), or that neither by word nor expression he may betray his thoughts. Others take the two outward expressions mentioned as signals to confederates; but this is not so suitable, as they are the man's own feelings and sentiments that are meant. One who gives these tokens <span class="cmt_word">bringeth evil to pass;</span> he has perfected his designs, and deems them as good as accomplished, and you will do well to note what his bearing signifies. Some take the meaning to be, brings punishment on himself; but the warning is not given for the sinner's sake. Septuagint, "He defines (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) all evils with his lips; he is a furnace of evil." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:27,28. Ungodly men bestow more pains to do mischief than would be needful to do good. The whisperer separates friends: what a hateful, but how common a character! 29,30. Some do all the mischief they can by force and violence, and are blind to the result. 31. Old people especially should be found in the way of religion and godliness. 32. To overcome our own passions, requires more steady management, than obtaining victory over an enemy. 33. All the disposal of Providence concerning our affairs, we must look upon to be the determining what we referred to God; and we must be reconciled to them accordingly. Blessed are those that give themselves up to the will of God; for he knows what is good for them.</body></html>
