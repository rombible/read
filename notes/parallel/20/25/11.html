In the latter case the phrase may mean a word quickly formed, or moving easily, spoken <span class="accented">ore rotundo</span>, or a speedy answer. But the metaphor is unusual and inappropriate; and it is best to understand a word spoken under due consideration of time and place. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui loquitur verbum in tempore suo</span>; Aquila and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "in circumstances that suit it;" the Septuagint has simply <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. Is like <span class="cmt_word">apples of gold in pictures of silver.</span> In these emblematical distichs the words, "is like," in the Authorized Version, are an insertion. The Hebrew places the two ideas merely in sequence; the object with which some, thing is compared usually coming before, that which is compared with it, as here, "Apples of gold - a word fitly spoken" (so in vers. 14, 18, 19, 26, 28). There is a doubt about the meaning of the word rendered "pictures," <span class="accented">maskith</span> (see on Proverbs 18:11). It seems to be used generally in the sense of "image," "sculpture," being derived from the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to see;" from this it comes to signify "ornament," and here most appropriately is "basket," and, as some understand, of filagree work. St. Jerome mistakes the word, rendering, <span class="accented">in lectis argenteis</span>. The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "on a necklace of sardius." "Apples of gold" are apples or other fruits of a golden colour, not made of gold, which would be very costly and heavy; nor would the comparison with artificial fruits be as suitable as that with natural. The "word" is the fruit set off by its circumstances, as the latter's beauty is enhanced by the grace of the vessel which contains it. The "apple" has been supposed to be the orange (called in late Latin <span class="accented">pomum aurantium</span>) or the citron. We may cite here the opinion of a competent traveller: "For my own part," says Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 605), "I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction that the <span class="accented">apricot</span> alone is the 'apple' of Scripture Everywhere the apricot is common; perhaps it is, with the single exception of the fig, the most abundant fruit of the country. In highlands and lowlands alike, by the shores of the Mediterranean and on the banks of the Jordan, in the nooks of Judea, under the heights of Lebanon, in the recesses of Galilee, and in the glades of Gilead, the apricot flourishes, and yields a crop of prodiscus abundance. Its characteristics meet every condition of the 'tappuach' of Scripture. 'I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-3.htm">Song of Solomon 2:3</a>). Near Damascus, and on the banks of the Barada, we have pitched our tents under its shade, and spread our carpets secure from the rays of the sun. 'The smell of thy nose (shall be) like tappuach' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-8.htm">Song of Solomon 7:8</a>). There can scarcely be a more deliciously perfumed fruit than the apricot; and what fruit can better fit the epithet of Solomon, 'apples of <span class="accented">gold</span> in pictures of silver,' than this golden fruit, as its branches bend under the weight in their setting of bright yet pale foliage?" Imagery similar to that found in this verse occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-2.htm">Proverbs 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-20.htm">Proverbs 18:20</a>. There is a famous article on the analogies between flowers and men's characters in the <span class="accented">Spectator</span>, No. 455. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-3 God needs not search into any thing; nothing can be hid from him. But it is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden works of darkness. 4,5. For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16. God has given us leave to use grateful things, but we are cautioned against excess.</body></html>
