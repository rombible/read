All travellers in Palestine note the great abundance of bees therein, and how well it answers to its description as "a land flowing with milk and honey." <span class="cmt_word">Eat so much as is sufficient for thee.</span> The agreeable sweetness of honey might lead the finder to eat too much of it. Against such excess the moralist warns: <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</span> Thus wrote Pindar, 'Nem.,' 7:51 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="foreign">Ne quid nimis</span>, is a maxim continually urged by those who wished to teach moderation. Says Homer, 'Iliad,' 13:636 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Men are with all things sated - sleep, and love,<br />Sweet sounds of music, and the joyous dance."</span><br />(<span class="note_acc">Lord Derby.</span>) Says Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:1, 106 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines,<br />Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum?"</span> The honey is a figure of all that pleases the senses; but the maxim is to be extended beyond physical matters, though referring primarily to such pleasures. The mind may be overloaded as well as the body: only such instruction as can be digested and assimilated is serviceable to the spiritual nature; injudicious cramming produces satiety and disgust. Again, "To 'find honey,'" says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 16:8), "is to taste the sweetness of holy intelligence, which is eaten enough of then when our perception, according to the measure of our faculty, is held tight under control. For he is 'filled with honey, and vomits it' who, in seeking to dive deeper than he has capacity for, loses that too from whence he might have derived nourishment." And in another place (ibid., 20:18), "The sweetness of spiritual meaning he who seeks to eat beyond what he contains, even what he had eaten he 'vomiteth;' because, whilst he seeks to make out things above, beyond his powers, even the things that he had made out aright, he forfeits" (Oxford transl.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-3 God needs not search into any thing; nothing can be hid from him. But it is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden works of darkness. 4,5. For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16. God has given us leave to use grateful things, but we are cautioned against excess.</body></html>
