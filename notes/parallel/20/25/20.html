(<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-15.htm" title="Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.">Romans 12:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather.</span> The proverb gives three instances of what is wrong, incongruous, or unwise, the first two leading up to the third, which is the pith of the maxim. But them is some doubt about the rendering of the first clause. The Authorized Version has the authority of the Syriac, Aquila, and others, and gives an appropriate sense, the unreasonable proceeding being the laying aside of some of one's own clothes in cold weather. But the verb here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">adah</span>), may also mean "to adorn," <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, with fine garments; hence some expositors understand the incongruity to be the dressing one's self in gay apparel in winter. But, as Delitzsch remarks, there is no reason why fine clothes should not be warm; and if they are so, there is nothing unreasonable in wearing them. The rendering of our version is probably correct. St. Jerome annexes this line to the preceding verse, as if it confirmed the previous instances of misplaced confidence, <span class="accented">Et amittit pallium in die frigoris</span>. "Such a one loses his cloak in a day of frost." <span class="cmt_word">Vinegar upon nitre.</span> Our nitre, or saltpetre, is nitrate of potash, which is not the substance intended by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nether</span>). The substance signified by this term is a natural alkali, known to the ancients as natron, and composed of carbonate of soda with some other admixture. It was used extensively for washing purposes, and in cookery and bread making. It effervesces with an acid, such as vinegar, and changes its character, becoming a salt, and being rendered useless for all the purposes to which it was applied in its alkaline condition. So he who pours vinegar on natron does a foolish thing, for he spoils a highly useful article, and produces one which is of no service to him. Septuagint, "As vinegar is inexpedient for a wound (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), so suffering falling on the body pains the heart." Schulteus, Ewald, and others, by referring <span class="accented">nether</span> to an Arabic source, obtain the meaning "wound," or "sore," titus: "As vinegar on a sore." This gives a most appropriate sense, and might well be adopted if it had sufficient authority. But this is doubtful. Cornelius a Lapide translates the Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f6d;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Sicut acetum trahit inutile;" and explains that vinegar draws from the soil the nitre which is prejudicial to vegetation, and thus renders ground fertile - a fact in agricultural chemistry not generally known, though Columella vouches for it. A somewhat similar fact, however, is of common experience. Land occasionally becomes what farmers term "sour," and is thus sterile; if it is then dressed with salt. its fertillity is restored. So is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. The inconsistency lies in thinking to cheer a sorrowful heart by singing merry songs. "A tale out of season," says Siracides, "is as music in mourning" (Ecclus. 22:6). The Greeks denoted cruel incongruity by the proverb, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; "Ludere inter maerentes." As the old hymn says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Strains of gladness<br />Suit not souls with anguish torn."</span> The true Christian sympathy teaches to "rejoice with them that rejoice, to weep with them that weep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>). Plumptre, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' suggests that the effervescence caused by the mixture of acid and alkali is taken as a type of the irritation produced by the inopportune songs. But this is importing a modern view into a paragraph, such as would never have occurred to the writer. The Septuagint, followed partially by Jerome, the Syriac, and the Targum, introduces another proverb not found in the Hebrew, "As a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so the sorrow of a man hurts his heart." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:19. Confidence in an unfaithful man is painful and vexatious; when we put any stress on him, he not only fails, but makes us feel for it. 20. We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow by endeavouring to make them merry. 21,22. The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment. Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we were enemies. 23. Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readily heard. Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly. 24. It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderance to the comfort of life. 25. Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence, in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in the witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children! 26. When the righteous are led into sin, it is as hurtful as if the public fountains were poisoned. 27. We must be, through grace, dead to the pleasures of sense, and also to the praises of men. 28. The man who has no command over his anger, is easily robbed of peace. Let us give up ourselves to the Lord, and pray him to put his Spirit within us, and cause us to walk in his statutes.</body></html>
