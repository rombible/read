Do not pay too frequent visits to your neighbors' house, or make yourself too much at home there. The Son of Sirach has an utterance on a somewhat similar subject, "Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house. Those things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of house room, and reproaching of the lender" (Ecclus. 29:27, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.</span> Such a result might easily arise from too constant intercourse. Cornelius a Lapide quotes from Seneca ('De Benefic,' 1:15), "Rarum esse oportet quod diu carum velis," "That should be rare which you would enduringly bear." And Martial's cynical advice - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nulli te facias nimis sodalem;<br />Gaudebis minus, et minus dolebis."</span> The same poet ('Epigr.,' 4:29, 3) writes - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Rara juvant; primis sic major gratia pomis,<br />Hibernae pretium sic meruere rosae."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:17. We cannot be upon good terms with our neighbours, without discretion as well as sincerity. How much better a Friend is God than any other friend! The oftener we come to him, the more welcome. 18.
