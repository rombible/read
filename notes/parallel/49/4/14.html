The distinction is marked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm" title="Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.">1Corinthians 14:20</a>, "Be not children in understanding: howbeit, in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men." Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.">1Corinthians 13:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-13.htm" title="For every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.">Hebrews 5:13</a>, it describes crudeness and shallowness of conception; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;">Galatians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>, incapability of free self-direction; here, liability to disturbance and change by every external impression from without, so as to be "everything by turns and nothing long."<p><span class= "bld">Tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.</span>--The metaphor is of a ship drifting at the mercy of a storm, tossed by the waves, and carried round from time to time by every blast. The word "tossed" is more properly used of the waves (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">James 1:6</a>) themselves, but the following words seem to show that here it is applied to the ship rising and falling with them. The word "doctrine," as usual, is a general word for all deliberate "teaching," whether acting on the understanding or the heart. It includes, in fact, all influence consciously exercised to a definite end.<p>The metaphor is then dropped, and the evil influences to which childish instability is a prey are described--first, as the "sleight," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the sleight of hand of the dice-thrower, describing quick, sudden deceit of detail; next (to substitute an accurate translation for the unusually paraphrastic rendering of our version), as a "craftiness devoted to the systematic plan of deceit," thus referring to deeper and subtler forms of delusion. This reference is so definite in the original, that we are tempted to believe St. Paul to have had in view some particular scheme of erroneous teaching, which had already struck root in the soil of Asia Minor. The Epistle to the Colossians shows that such false teaching had appeared itself at Colossae; it was, perhaps, the germ of the more full-grown Gnosticism noted in the Pastoral Epistles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That we he no more children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of teaching.</span> The apostle goes back to illustrate in another way the purpose of the ministry; it is designed to remedy childish fickleness and the causes that lead to it. The ignorant and inexperienced lie at the mercy of abler persons, and, when there is no regular ministry provided by Christ, are liable to be swept along by any plausible person that professes to be a Christian teacher, and such persons are often very dangerous, working <span class="cmt_word">by the sleight of men,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cunning legerdemain by which the teachings of men - teachings devised by the hearts of men - are made to appear to the uninitiated the same as Christ's teaching. <span class="cmt_word">In craftiness, tending to the scheme of error.</span> Such teachers employ crafty methods, apparently harmless, but tending to further the method or scheme of error. The strong language here used corresponds with that in which, at Miletus, the apostle warned the elders of Ephesus of the "grievous wolves" that were to come in among them, and of the men "speaking perverse things" that were to arise among themselves, not sparing the flock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.</body></html>
