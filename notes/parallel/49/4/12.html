The preposition (<span class= "ital">eis</span>) used in the two latter clauses (which should be <span class= "ital">unto work of ministration, unto edification of the body of Christ</span>) properly signifies "contact with a thing," and the preposition (<span class= "ital">pros</span>) used in the first clause, "direction towards a thing." The two are often apparently interchanged; but in close juxtaposition here can hardly be intended to be identical or exactly parallel; and, if distinction is to be drawn, the former must signify immediate consequence, and the other the remoter object to which such immediate consequence is designed to minister. The construction would be greatly simplified, if inversion of the first two clauses could be allowed. For it would then run, "unto work of ministration with a view to perfecting of saints, unto building up of the body of Christ;" and so would plainly represent the two-fold operation of the ministry: first, its work in its various offices for the perfecting of individual souls; and next, its general direction to the building up of the whole body. But whether this construction be grammatically possible or not, this appears to be in any case the general sense of the passage.<p><span class= "bld">The perfecting of the saints.</span>--The word rendered "perfecting" (akin to the "perfection" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm" title="For we are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.">2Corinthians 13:9</a>) is derived from a root which signifies either to "mend" what is broken (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>), or to "complete" what is unfinished (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-40.htm" title="The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.">Luke 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>); and hence is used spiritually for to "restore" the fallen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>), or to "perfect" the imperfect Christian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-21.htm" title="Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Hebrews 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1Thessalonians 3:10</a>). Both processes are necessarily implied in that perfection of the individual saints here spoken of, and more fully described in the next verses.<p><span class= "bld">The edifying of the body of Christ.</span>--This is that part of the work of the ministry (as in preaching and ministering in public worship) which tells upon the Church or congregation as a whole. It is here represented as subsequent, perhaps as subordinate, to the individual pastoral dealing with souls. But each has his own gift. Some ministries are more blessed to the individual perfecting of the saints; others to the building up of the whole Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In order to the perfecting of the saints.</span> The ultimate end for which the gifts bestowed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).

All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.</body></html>
