These last most of all depend on the "fellow-working" of man--primarily in the soul receiving them, and secondarily in all who can influence it for good and for evil.<p>We have here a perfect and exhaustive exposition of the unity of the Church, on which depend the other qualities of "Holiness," "Catholicity," and "Apostolicity" ascribed to it in the Creed. In other passages the essential life of the Church is attributed, now to the revelation of the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17-18</a>), now to the indwelling presence of the Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>), now to the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38-39</a>). Here all are united in one comprehensive view. The order, however, is natural, not artificial. The exhortation to peace naturally leads to the conception of one Body, animated by the "one Spirit"; next, the remembrance of their calling leads to the "one Lord," who called them to Him in one faith and by one baptism; and all ends in the contemplation of the "one God and Father," who is not only above all and through all His creation, but specially in those who are adopted to a new sonship in Christ. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-22.htm" title="Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?">John 14:22-23</a>.) In its completeness and depth this passage stands alone. It is interesting to compare and contrast with it the equally celebrated passage occupying the corresponding place in the Colossian Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1-4</a>), and to gather from this the mingled similarity and difference in the main idea of those two Epistles--the Ephesian Epistle dwelling especially on the unity and regeneration of the whole body, the Colossian Epistle on the sole Headship and Deity of Christ.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.</span>--This "being worthy of the Christian calling" may obviously show itself in any of the graces of regenerate humanity, all being features of the image of Christ. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1Peter 1:15</a> it expresses itself in "holiness" (as in the frequent phrase "called to be saints"); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Philippians 1:27-30</a>, in steadfastness of faith. But in this passage the especial point which has been dwelt upon in their calling is the fact that they were aliens, helpless and miserable, and that they are now united in one body with the ancient people of God. Hence, naturally, the graces declared to correspond with their calling, so viewed, are the graces of humility and gentleness, teaching them to sink all thought of self in "the unity of the Spirit."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-16.</span> - CHURCH PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH AND PROGRESS; THE CHURCH A BODY. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I therefore</span>. Inference not only from last chapter, but the whole Epistle. Paul's interest in the Ephesians led him to a double application of the great subject which he had expounded: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to ask God on their behalf that he would bestow on them the full measure of the blessing to which of his grace they were entitled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-21</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to entreat them on God's behalf to live in a way befitting their high calling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>.). To this second application he proceeds now. <span class="cmt_word">The prisoner in the Lord.</span> Not merely "of the Lord," but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>, the usual formula for vital communion with Christ, indicating that his captivity was the captivity of a part or member of the Lord. An exhortation from such a prisoner ought to fall with double weight. <span class="cmt_word">Beseech you to walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye were called.</span> Their call was to be God's people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a>); this not a mere speculative distinction, but one that must have practical form and that must lead to suitable fruit. True grace in the heart must show itself by true goodness in the life. They were not to conceal their religion, not to be ashamed of it, but to avow it and glory in it, and their lives were not to be disgraced by unworthy conduct, but to be brightened and elevated by their relation to Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Nothing is pressed more earnestly in the Scriptures, than to walk as becomes those called to Christ's kingdom and glory. By lowliness, understand humility, which is opposed to pride. By meekness, that excellent disposition of soul, which makes men unwilling to provoke, and not easily to be provoked or offended. We find much in ourselves for which we can hardly forgive ourselves; therefore we must not be surprised if we find in others that which we think it hard to forgive. There is one Christ in whom all believers hope, and one heaven they are all hoping for; therefore they should be of one heart. They had all one faith, as to its object, Author, nature, and power. They all believed the same as to the great truths of religion; they had all been admitted into the church by one baptism, with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as the sign of regeneration. In all believers God the Father dwells, as in his holy temple, by his Spirit and special grace.</body></html>
