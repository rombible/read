It is on the indwelling of Christ in each heart by faith that the spiritual unity of all Christians--primarily with Him, secondarily with one another--depends; and that spiritual unity is "put on" in baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>), in which we are "buried with Him and risen again" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>), growing into the likeness of His death and resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3-5</a>). Again we note that, with but few exceptions, all Christians, even in the divided condition of the Church, are still united in the "one baptism;" and if we look to such expressions of the one faith as are contained in the baptismal profession (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>of the Apostles' Creed), it is clear that our divisions, great as they are, turn mainly on the fourth subsidiary Article on the "Holy Catholic Church," and not on the three primary Articles of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. In these the mass of Christendom has still one faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Nothing is pressed more earnestly in the Scriptures, than to walk as becomes those called to Christ's kingdom and glory. By lowliness, understand humility, which is opposed to pride. By meekness, that excellent disposition of soul, which makes men unwilling to provoke, and not easily to be provoked or offended. We find much in ourselves for which we can hardly forgive ourselves; therefore we must not be surprised if we find in others that which we think it hard to forgive. There is one Christ in whom all believers hope, and one heaven they are all hoping for; therefore they should be of one heart. They had all one faith, as to its object, Author, nature, and power. They all believed the same as to the great truths of religion; they had all been admitted into the church by one baptism, with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as the sign of regeneration. In all believers God the Father dwells, as in his holy temple, by his Spirit and special grace.</body></html>
