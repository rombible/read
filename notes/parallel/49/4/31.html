Here the first symptom of the temper forbidden is "bitterness," or <span class= "ital">sharpness</span>--a word seldom used, and generally in half-poetical passages (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm" title="For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.">Acts 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-14.htm" title="Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:">Romans 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>)--that is, an acerbity of temper, ready to take offence and break out in anger. The next stage is "wrath and anger," that is, passionate outburst, and the deeper anger of which it is at once effect and cause. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm" title="And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.">Revelation 19:15</a>.) In these the smouldering bitterness kindles into flame. The last stage is "clamour and evil speaking"--"clamour" (used in this sense only here) being the loud fury of the first burst of wrath, passing into the more deliberate evil-speaking, as the temper cools down without losing its settled anger.<p><span class= "bld">With all malice.</span>--All are various exhibitions of "malice"--that is, evil mindedness or malignity--the general disposition which is the opposite of goodness, graciousness, and sympathy. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm" title="Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.">1Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">James 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1Peter 2:1</a>.) By the law of human nature they rise out of this temper, and react upon it so as to intensify its bitterness. Both it generally, and they in particular, must be resisted and cast out.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let all bitterness</span>; not only in speech, but in mind, disposition, habit. And wrath and anger; nearly synonymous, but perhaps" wrath" is equivalent to the tumultuous excited state of mind, out of which comes anger, the settled feeling of dislike and enmity. <span class="cmt_word">And clamor and evil-speaking be put away from you</span>; "clamor," equivalent to the loud noise of strife, the excited shouting down of opponents; "evil-speaking," the more deliberate habit of running down their character, exciting an evil feeling against them in the minds of others. <span class="cmt_word">With all malice</span>; equivalent to wishing evil, whether in a more pronounced or in a latent and half-conscious form, whether expressing itself in the way of coarse malediction or lurking in a corner of the heart, as an evil spirit of which we should be ashamed; all are rags of the old man, as disgraceful to Christians as literal rags to a man of position; utterly unworthy of the regenerated child of God. Chrysostom, rather fancifully, treats them as a genealogy: "Bitterness bred wrath, wrath anger, anger clamor, clamor evil-speaking, which is railing." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:29-32 Filthy words proceed from corruption in the speaker, and they corrupt the minds and manners of those who hear them: Christians should beware of all such discourse. It is the duty of Christians to seek, by the blessing of God, to bring persons to think seriously, and to encourage and warn believers by their conversation. Be ye kind one to another. This sets forth the principle of love in the heart, and the outward expression of it, in a humble, courteous behaviour. Mark how God's forgiveness causes us to forgive. God forgives us, though we had no cause to sin against him. We must forgive, as he has forgiven us. All lying, and corrupt communications, that stir up evil desires and lusts, grieve the Spirit of God. Corrupt passions of bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, evil-speaking, and malice, grieve the Holy Spirit. Provoke not the holy, blessed Spirit of God to withdraw his presence and his gracious influences. The body will be redeemed from the power of the grave at the resurrection day. Wherever that blessed Spirit dwells as a Sanctifier, he is the earnest of all the joys and glories of that redemption day; and we should be undone, should God take away his Holy Spirit from us.</body></html>
