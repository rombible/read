But both order and sense seem to point to the connection given in our version. The correct rendering is, <span class= "ital">being true in love; </span>including in this the "being true" to others, by speaking truly and acting honestly towards them (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>), but including also the "being true" absolutely--that is, the loving the truth, and clinging to it at all costs.

To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.

He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>), or "having the truth in us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1John 1:8</a>); sometimes as "doing the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>), and "walking in the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2John 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-4.htm" title="I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.">3John 1:4</a>). In all cases it is closely connected with the idea of unity with Him who is Himself "the Truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>).<p>With the phrase "being true in love" we may compare the corresponding phrase of "loving in truth . . . for the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2John 1:1</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm" title="Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.">Ephesians 4:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.">3John 1:1</a>). In both we recognise the harmony of the two great principles of individuality and unity, on which true humanity, and therefore likeness to God, depends. In the contemplation and love of truth each of us is alone; even in the speaking and doing truth towards others we have to consult only God and our own conscience, which is His voice within. In love, on the contrary, we deny and sacrifice self, merging our individual being in humanity or in God. Taking the first alone, we have a hard, almost stoical, self-concentration; taking the other alone, it may become towards man an idolatry, to which both truth and freedom are sacrificed, and even towards God may pass into a mysticism, in which all active energy is lost. Uniting both, we have the perfect humanity, at once individual and social, at once free before God and lost in God. Accordingly, it is thus that we "grow up into Him who is the Head, even Christ," who, by perfect truth and perfect love, manifested to us in His humanity all the fulness of God.<p><span class= "bld">The head, even Christ.</span>--In this name of our Lord we have the link of connection between the individual perfection and corporate unity. He is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>) the Head of each man. He is also the Head of the whole Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But speaking the truth in love.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is hardly translatable in English it implies being true as well as speaking the truth and following the truth. Truth is the element in which we are to live, move, and have our being; fidelity to truth is the backbone of the Christian ministry. But truth must be inseparably married to love; good tidings spoken harshly are no good tidings; the charm of the message is destroyed by the discordant spirit of the messenger. The more painful the first impression which a truth is fitted to produce (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">Ephesians</span> 2:1-3), the more need is there for dealing with it in love - a much-needed and much-neglected exhortation. <span class="cmt_word">May grow up into him in all things who is the Head, namely, Christ.</span> Growing up <span class="accented">into</span> Christ is like baptizing <span class="accented">into</span> the Name of the Father, etc.; it implies that the growth tends to a closer union to Christ, as, on the other hand, union to Christ causes the growth: the two act and react on each other. This growth is to be "in all things" - in the whole man - in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, in all the communicable properties of Christ. How great the work of growth is that should be sought in the case of every living believer is evident from the enormous gulf there is between his spiritual and moral state and that of Christ. Yet such growth is reasonable, considering the relation of the body to him, its Head. The fact of this relation should encourage us to seek and expect the growth, and encourage ministers to labor hopefully towards promoting it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.</body></html>
