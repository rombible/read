Such faith always goes on to knowledge, that is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>) "full knowledge" of Him in whom we have believed. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2Peter 1:17</a>, "Add to your faith virtue" (that is, energy in well-doing), "and to virtue knowledge." This knowledge (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>) is gained mainly through the love in which faith is made perfect.<p><span class= "bld">Of the Son of God.</span>--These words should be connected with the word "faith" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>) as well as "knowledge." They are probably to be considered as a distinctive phrase, designating our Lord especially as glorified and exalted to the right hand of the Father in "the glory which he had with the Father before the world was." So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>, He is "declared to be the Son of God by the Resurrection;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>, "Jesus the Son of God" is "the High Priest ascended into the heavens." Compare also our Lord's declaration that "if any man speaks against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a>) with the declaration of the certain vengeance on him who "treads under foot the Son of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>). Note again, in St. John's First Epistle, the constant reference to the belief in and confession of Jesus as "the Son of God" as the one thing needful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-10.htm" title="Proving what is acceptable to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-20.htm" title="Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;">Ephesians 5:20</a>). For on the belief not only of what He was on earth, but of what He is in heaven, all distinctive Christianity depends. If He is only "Son of Man" He cannot be the universal Saviour.<p><span class= "bld">Unto a perfect</span> (that is, <span class= "ital">full-grown</span>) <span class= "bld">man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</span>--In these words are described the second great object of the ministries of the Church--not only the production of faith and knowledge of the Son of God, but the formation of Christ in the soul, as "dwelling in the heart through faith." This image of Christ in "fullness" is the absolutely perfect humanity, showing forth the image of God. Each can partake of it only up to "the measure" which God gives him. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>.) When he so partakes of it to the utmost, he is "full-grown" (relatively, not absolutely, perfect) up to the spiritual "stature" assigned to him, although (as in the body) that stature may vary in different persons, and in none can perfectly attain to the whole "fulness" of Christ. The rendering, "stature" is preferable to <span class= "ital">age, </span>as suiting better the context, though both are fully admissible under New Testament usage. On the word "fulness," see Note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until we all come.</span> This marks the duration of the office of the ministry. Some maintain that it implies that <span class="accented">all</span> these offices are to continue in the Church until the result specified is obtained (Catholic Apostolic or Irvingite Church): this is contradicted by Scripture and by experience, so far as apostles and prophets are concerned, for the gifts for these offices were not continued, and without the gifts the offices are impossible. The meaning is that, till the event specified, there is to be a provision in the Church of the offices that are needed, and the apostle, in using "until," probably had in view the last office in his list - pastors and teachers. <span class="cmt_word">To the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God.</span> Both genitives are governed by unity; already there is one faith (ver. 5), but we all, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. all who compose or are yet to compose the body of Christ, the totality of this body, have to be brought to this faith. As in ver. 5 "faith" is not equivalent to "creed," or truth believed, but the act of believing; so here the consummation which the ministers of the Church are given to bring about is a state in which faith in the Son of God shall characterize all, and that, not a blind faith, but a faith associated with knowledge. Usually faith and knowledge are opposed to each other; but here faith has more the meaning of trust than of mere belief - trust based on knowledge, trust in the Son of God based on knowledge of his Person, his work, and his relation to them that receive him. To bring all the elect to this faith is the object of the ministry; when they are all brought to it, the body of Christ will be complete, and the functions of the Christian ministry will cease. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</span> The idea of organic completeness is more fully expressed by these two clauses; the consummation is the completeness of the whole body of Christ as <span class="accented">such</span>; but that involves the maturity of each individual who is a constituent part of that body; and the measure or sign of maturity, both for the individual and for the whole, is the stature of the fullness of Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, "<span class="accented">Whom</span> he did foreknow, them he also foredained to be <span class="accented">conformed to the image of his Son"</span>). The question has been put - Will this consummation be in this life or the next? The one seems to melt into the other; the idea of a complete Church and that of a new economy seem inseparable; as the coming of Christ will terminate the observance of the Lord's Supper, so it will terminate the ministries ordained by Christ for the completion of his Church. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.</body></html>
