They seem to correspond almost exactly to the first, third, and fifth beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount, in which the principle of love is wrought out in various forms (as in the other beatitudes the principle of righteousness): "Blessed are the poor in spirit;" "Blessed are the meek;" "Blessed are the merciful." The word "lowliness of mind" is used by St. Paul only in the Epistles of the Captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Philippians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>) and in the address to the Ephesian presbyters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>). It is, indeed, a word new coined in Christian terminology, and even the root from which it comes is mostly used by the heathen moralists in a bad sense (of meanness and slavishness), of which there is still a trace in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. "Meekness" is mostly "gentleness"--"the meek and quiet spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm" title="But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.">1Peter 3:4</a>)--the natural, though not the invariable, fruit of humility, winning souls by its very absence of bitter self-assertion, and so "inheriting the earth." "Longsuffering" is the manifestation of such meekness, with something of especial effort and struggle, in the bearing of injury.<p>(2, 3) <span class= "bld">Forbearing one another in love</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The word rendered "endeavouring" is, in the original, a word expressing "earnestness" of thought and exertion to secure a thing not lightly obtained. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-9.htm" title="Do your diligence to come shortly to me:">2Timothy 4:9-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm" title="Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:">2Peter 1:10</a>.) It shows that St. Paul here passes from the negative aspects of love, summed up in forbearance, to the more positive and energetic enthusiasm for unity and peace. Love is in both aspects, the "uniting bond" of peace. In the parallel passage of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm" title=" And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.">Colossians 3:14</a>, it is "put on over" all else, and is the uniting "bond of perfectness." In the celebrated thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4-7</a>) it is made to include "long-suffering" and "kindness," and all forms of humility and gentleness. But, if it be real, it must necessarily pass into active energy; if it is to win the final beatitude of "blessing to the peacemakers," it must "labour for peace," and "follow after the things which make for peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-7.htm" title="I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.">Psalm 120:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm" title="Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another.">Romans 14:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The unity of the Spirit</span> is certainly the unity given by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. This we cannot create, for it is the gift of God; but we can "keep" it: that is, cherish it, guard it, and make it effectual by love; and all experience proves that, if we would so keep it, we need the positive earnestness of exertion against evils without and within.<p>-2<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7-11</a> pass from the unity of the Church to the diversity of graces and offices in its members, all being gifts of the ascended Lord, and results of that universal mediation which fills all things.<p>(2) From this general description of the regeneration of the soul out of the death of sin, in the Lord Jesus Christ, St. Paul now passes on to deal with special moral duties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-25.htm" title="Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.">Ephesians 4:25-30</a>)--the casting out of falsehood, wrath, dishonesty, and impurity, which are the four typical sins forbidden in the four general Commandments of the Second Table--the Ninth, the Sixth, the Eighth, and the Seventh. But he treats all with a marked and striking peculiarity of treatment--in relation to the great principle of unity in Christ, rather than in relation to a man's own nature or his individual responsibility to God. In this treatment he shows the vivid practical application of the characteristic doctrine of this Epistle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - SOME POINTS OF A WORTHY WALK. <span class="cmt_word">With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love.</span> He begins his enumeration with passive graces - eminently those of Christ. Lowliness or humility may well be gendered by our remembering what we were when God's grace took hold of us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>). <span class="accented">Meek</span>ness is the natural expression of a lowly state of mind, opposed to boisterous self-assertion and rude striving with others; it genders a subdued manner and a peace-loving spirit that studies to give the soft answer that turneth away wrath. Long-suffering and loving forbearance are phases of the same state of mind - denoting the absence of that irascibility and proneness to take offence which flares up at every provocation or fancied neglect, and strives to maintain self-control on every occasion. It is from such qualities in God that our redemption has come; it is miserable to <span class="accented">accept</span> the redemption and not try to attain and exhibit its true spirit. Neglect of this verse has produced untold evil in the Christian Church <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Nothing is pressed more earnestly in the Scriptures, than to walk as becomes those called to Christ's kingdom and glory. By lowliness, understand humility, which is opposed to pride. By meekness, that excellent disposition of soul, which makes men unwilling to provoke, and not easily to be provoked or offended. We find much in ourselves for which we can hardly forgive ourselves; therefore we must not be surprised if we find in others that which we think it hard to forgive. There is one Christ in whom all believers hope, and one heaven they are all hoping for; therefore they should be of one heart. They had all one faith, as to its object, Author, nature, and power. They all believed the same as to the great truths of religion; they had all been admitted into the church by one baptism, with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as the sign of regeneration. In all believers God the Father dwells, as in his holy temple, by his Spirit and special grace.</body></html>
