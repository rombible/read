They who are ministers of His gifts are themselves gifts from Him to the Church.<p><span class= "bld">Some, apostles; and some, prophets . . .</span>--With this passage we must compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>, "God hath set some in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings," &c.; and, perhaps, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/12-6.htm" title="Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;">Romans 12:6-8</a>, "Having then gifts . . . whether prophecy . . . or ministry . . . or teaching . . . or exhortation . . .," although this last passage is lass formally apposite. In all three cases there is the same general idea, first of the one body, and then of the one Spirit, guiding and animating it through various ministries. The parallel between this passage and the passage in 1 Cor. is very close; for in the latter all that follows the words "after that" may be put aside, as describing, not special offices or ministries, but special gifts. We have, therefore, in both, "first apostles, secondly prophets." Then come, in the earlier Epistle, "teachers;" and this class, in our own later Epistle, is subdivided into "evangelists" and "pastors," both being teachers--the one in conversion of those still aliens from Christ, the other in edification of those already brought into His flock.<p><span class= "bld">Some, apostles.</span>--The name "apostles" is certainly used here in its technical and restricted sense, as applying to the Twelve, whom "the Apostle" of God Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>) named as His Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-13.htm" title="And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;">Luke 6:13</a>), and with whom St. Paul claims equality (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.">1Corinthians 15:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>) on the ground of his own special mission and revelation from the same Lord. It is, indeed, used in a wider sense; sometimes with words distinctly implying a derivation and human mission, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a>, "apostles (or, <span class= "ital">messengers</span>) of the churches;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25</a>, "Epaphroditus, your apostle (or, <span class= "ital">messenger</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span>" sometimes without such qualification, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.">2Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.">2Corinthians 12:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1Thessalonians 2:7</a>; and, perhaps, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>. But such use is rare, and cannot be applied to a passage like this, which is distinctive of a special and primary class. In direct charge from the Lord, universal scope of mission, special inspiration and power of miracle, which are "the signs of an apostle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2Corinthians 12:12</a>), the Apostles, properly so called, stood out in office absolutely unique and supreme. What was said of the first age of the Church is true of all ages--"of the rest durst no man join himself unto them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-13.htm" title="And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.">Acts 5:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Some, prophets.</span>--For the nature and function of prophecy in the Church, see the detailed treatment of the subject by St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 14. It is sufficient here to note (1) that from very early times the "prophets" are mentioned as a separate class (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm" title="And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.">Acts 21:10</a>), distinguished from teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>), and that, in this Epistle especially, they are spoken of, in connection with the Apostles, as receiving the revealed mystery of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>), and being (or, <span class= "ital">laying</span>) "the foundation of the Church;" (2) that their office, like the Apostolate, is clearly extraordinary, distinct from the ordinary and permanent teaching of the evangelists and pastors, and, probably, best described by the two phrases so constantly applied to the prophets of the Old Testament--"the word of the Lord came to me;" "the Spirit of the Lord was upon me." As all God's extraordinary gifts and workings are closely correlated with His ordinary laws of operation, so in this case the apostolic and prophetic offices gradually melt away into the regular functions of government and teaching, belonging in all times to the ministry of the Church.<p><span class= "bld">Some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.</span>--In these two phrases (corresponding to the simple word "teachers" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>) we find described the two-fold office of the regular ministry of the Church--first, to preach the gospel to the heathen or the unconverted, and next, to fulfil our Lord's pastoral charge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/21-15.htm" title="So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.">John 21:15-17</a>) of feeding and shepherding those who are already His sheep. It is clear that the same person may be invested with the two offices, as Timothy, when in pastoral charge at Ephesus, is bidden "to do the work of an evangelist" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>); and that in some degree the two offices must always be united, for the evangelist, like the apostle, is generally called upon to organise and "confirm the churches" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/14-22.htm" title="Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.">Acts 14:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>), and the pastor must always find men unconverted, to whom he must be an evangelist. But the two elements of duty will co-exist in different proportions in different persons. Some were then, and are now, especially called to be "evangelists"--that is, as is shown by the career of Philip, to whom the name is first given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>), to be, under the apostolic guidance, missionaries to the unconverted; others to be "pastors and teachers," feeding now with "pure milk of the word," now with "solid meat" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>), those already gathered into the fold, and exercising over them the pastoral authority solemnly committed by our Lord to His ministers. Yet both can discharge only under limitation the functions which in the Apostles were practically unlimited.<p>On the question whether this celebrated passage describes the regular orders or the functions, ordinary and extraordinary, of the ministry, we may fairly say that while no doubt the very genius of the passage points to the latter alternative, yet the ultimate appeal must be made to history. It is clear, from the nature of the case, that none could inherit the direct and universal commission from Christ held by the Apostles; it is certain historically that the supernatural gifts of prophecy and miracle passed away; it is hardly less indisputable that the two functions of evangelism and pastorate were always shared among the three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons after the close of the Apostolic age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gave some (to be) apostles.</span> Coming back to the diversity of gifts (ver. 7), He enumerates some of these, as Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">he</span>, emphatic) bestowed them. The organization of the Church is not a mere human arrangement; its officers are of Divine appointment. The first gift is, his apostles. It is not meant that he gave to some the gifts needed to constitute them apostles, though that is true; but that, having qualified some to be apostles, he gave them to the Church. An apostle had his commission direct from Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>); he possessed supernatural gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>); it was necessary for him to have seen the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>); his diocese was the whole world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>). The apostles were the constituent body of the Church - they had all necessary gifts for setting it up, and as all Christian history has testified, they were a marvelous gift of Christ to his Church. <span class="cmt_word">And some, prophets.</span> Next to the apostles in point of value, as gifts to the Church, having supernatural knowledge of God's will present and future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>). Prophets were indispensable before the New Testament was given as the Church's infallible guide to the will of God, but not apparently necessary after the will of God was fully recorded. <span class="cmt_word">And some, evangelists.</span> The nature of this office is known only from the meaning of the term and the work of those who bore the designation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>) - persons not attached to a particular congregation, but who went about preaching the glad tidings, and otherwise building up the Church, but without the full powers of apostles. <span class="cmt_word">And some, pastors and teachers.</span> The more ordinary settled ministers of congregations, called pastors, because they watched over the flock, trying to lead all in right ways; and teachers, because they communicated Divine knowledge. Some have thought that each expression denotes a separate office, but, coupled as they are together, it is better to regard them as indicating two functions of one office (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.</body></html>
