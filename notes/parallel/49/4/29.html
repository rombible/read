By the corrupt word, probably, here is meant especially the foul word, which is rotten in itself, and spreads rottenness in others.<p><span class= "bld">The use of edifying.</span>--This is a mistranslation, by inversion, of a difficult expression, "the building up of the need"--that is, the supplying by suggestion of good the peculiar "need" or defect of the hearer's spiritual state. Perhaps, as before, the word "good" may be taken for <span class= "ital">gracious</span> and full of sympathy, noting by the quick insight of love what each man's need is, and hastening to speak accordingly, so as to "give grace" or blessing to meet that peculiar need. The same use of the word "grace" is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2Corinthians 1:15</a> ("that ye might have a second benefit"). The same idea is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1Thessalonians 3:10</a>, "to perfect that which is lacking in your faith."<p>Here again we have a similar treatment of moral duty. The corrupt word is forbidden, not because it defiles the speaker's own soul, and is an offence in the pure eyes of God, but because it is a sin against others, pulling down instead of building them up, and aggravating, instead of supplying, their moral defects. Like the falsehood, and wrath, and dishonesty, forbidden above, it sins against the unity of all in God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth.</span> Not pagans only, but some of whom better things might be expected, need this charge. How revolting is the tendency in some circles to foul and blasphemous conversation; to profane and obscene jests, songs, and allusions: to feed as it were on moral garbage! From Christian mouths no such word should ever issue - it is simply abominable. <span class="cmt_word">But that which is good for improvement of the occasion, that it may give grace to them that hear.</span> Speaking should ever bear on improvement or edification, especially on turning passing things to good account. This should be the aim; it does not require speaking to be uniformly grave, but <span class="accented">to have an object</span>. It may be quite right to have an <span class="accented">enlivening</span> object, but among Christians it should always be such as befits their profession, and tends to help on the exalted objects at which they aim. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:29-32 Filthy words proceed from corruption in the speaker, and they corrupt the minds and manners of those who hear them: Christians should beware of all such discourse. It is the duty of Christians to seek, by the blessing of God, to bring persons to think seriously, and to encourage and warn believers by their conversation. Be ye kind one to another. This sets forth the principle of love in the heart, and the outward expression of it, in a humble, courteous behaviour. Mark how God's forgiveness causes us to forgive. God forgives us, though we had no cause to sin against him. We must forgive, as he has forgiven us. All lying, and corrupt communications, that stir up evil desires and lusts, grieve the Spirit of God. Corrupt passions of bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, evil-speaking, and malice, grieve the Holy Spirit. Provoke not the holy, blessed Spirit of God to withdraw his presence and his gracious influences. The body will be redeemed from the power of the grave at the resurrection day. Wherever that blessed Spirit dwells as a Sanctifier, he is the earnest of all the joys and glories of that redemption day; and we should be undone, should God take away his Holy Spirit from us.</body></html>
