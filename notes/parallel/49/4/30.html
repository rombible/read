The four cardinal sins forbidden are regarded as "grieving the Holy Spirit of God." In that expression, even more than in the cognate expressions of "quenching the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1Thessalonians 5:19</a>), and "resisting the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>), there is implied a personal relation to a Divine Person, capable of being "grieved" by our transgressions, partly as sins against His perfect holiness, partly as suicidal rejections of His unfailing love. In the description of this effect of sin we have the needful complement to the view hitherto taken of its effect, as marring our unity with men; for that unity is always in God, through the Holy Spirit working out in each soul the image of Christ. "There is one Body" only because "there is one Spirit." Sin vexes the one, but grieves the other.<p><span class= "bld">Whereby ye are sealed.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">in whom ye were sealed.</span> See the fuller expression of the same truth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>, and the Notes there. The reference to it is here emphatic. The "sealing unto the day of redemption" reminds us of the glorious consummation to which we are destined, and from which every sin is a falling off. The very thought of this perfection, with all its associations of purity and love, should shame us from sin.<p>This general exhortation seems fitly to close the warning against the series of typical sins, which is itself exhaustive of the general sins against men. In the passage which follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm" title="Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.">Ephesians 5:21</a>) St. Paul does not indeed traverse new ground, but dwells with special emphasis on some of these sins, which especially beset the society to which he wrote, viz.: (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>) bitterness, (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3-14</a>) impurity, (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-15.htm" title="See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,">Ephesians 5:15-21</a>) reckless excess.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God.</span> Very solemn and emphatic counsel. The name is given with unusual fullness, in order to show the magnitude of the sin - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "The Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God." By an anthropopathy the Spirit is represented as grieved by such treatment as would grieve <span class="accented">us - e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>. when his work is obstructed, when sin is trifled with, when Deity is treated carelessly, when place is given to the devil, when the spirit of the world is cherished. Those who act thus resemble the Sanballats and Tobiahs of the time of the restoration, who hindred the rebuilding of the temple and the restoration of order and prosperity. When the Holy Spirit would urge consecration, separation from the world, holy exercises, active service, our indolent and worldly hearts are liable to rebel and vex him. To grieve a parent heedlessly is a great sin; how much more to grieve the Spirit of God? <span class="cmt_word">In whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.</span> The Spirit being rather the Seal than the Sealer, who is the Father (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>), it is better to translate <span class="accented">in</span> whom than <span class="accented">by</span> whom; besides, this preserves the force of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, which, whether used of Christ or of the other persons of the Godhead, is so characteristic of the Epistle. To grieve the Spirit is to help to obliterate the seal, and thus weaken the evidence of our redemption. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:29-32 Filthy words proceed from corruption in the speaker, and they corrupt the minds and manners of those who hear them: Christians should beware of all such discourse. It is the duty of Christians to seek, by the blessing of God, to bring persons to think seriously, and to encourage and warn believers by their conversation. Be ye kind one to another. This sets forth the principle of love in the heart, and the outward expression of it, in a humble, courteous behaviour. Mark how God's forgiveness causes us to forgive. God forgives us, though we had no cause to sin against him. We must forgive, as he has forgiven us. All lying, and corrupt communications, that stir up evil desires and lusts, grieve the Spirit of God. Corrupt passions of bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, evil-speaking, and malice, grieve the Holy Spirit. Provoke not the holy, blessed Spirit of God to withdraw his presence and his gracious influences. The body will be redeemed from the power of the grave at the resurrection day. Wherever that blessed Spirit dwells as a Sanctifier, he is the earnest of all the joys and glories of that redemption day; and we should be undone, should God take away his Holy Spirit from us.</body></html>
