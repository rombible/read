To "put on the new man" is, therefore, to "put on the Lord Jesus Christ," by that divine process of which we have the beginning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>, the continuation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>, and the completion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-53.htm" title="For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.">1Corinthians 15:53-54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2Corinthians 5:3</a>. For He is "the new man," "the second Adam," "formed after God, in righteousness and holiness of the truth."<p><span class= "bld">Holiness</span> (used only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-75.htm" title="In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.">Luke 1:75</a>) is "purity" consecrated to God in His "Holy One" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm" title="Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 2:27</a>). It describes the "purity of heart" of which our Lord Himself speaks as a still higher grace, gifted with a higher reward, than even "hunger and thirst after righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-6.htm" title="Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.">Matthew 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>). "Righteousness" is goodness shown to others, to man and to God: "holiness" is goodness in itself, as it is in "the High and Holy One who inhabiteth eternity." Stress is laid upon it here in contrast with the lusts and uncleanness described above.<p><span class= "bld">Truth</span> is similarly opposed to the "deceit" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>. Christ is Himself "the Truth," as being the manifestation of "the fulness of the Godhead." As the corrupting and beguiling lusts belong to the spirit of Deceit, so righteousness and holiness to the Truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And put on the new man.</span> As the fruit of inward renewal, let there be outward renovation. A new object is clean, fresh, tidy; let your life have something of the same aspect - let your principles, aims, habits, be new, in the sense of being conformed to Christ, who is your life. <span class="cmt_word">Which after God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.</span> "After God," equivalent to "after the image of him that created him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>). Some think" the new man" equivalent to "Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>), constituted the Head of renewed humanity, as Adam of depraved. But this would not correspond with the exhortation to put off the old man, nor should we be exhorted to put on Christ <span class="accented">after</span> being exhorted to be renewed in the spirit of our minds. In what sense, then, has the "new man" been created? The idea presented itself to the apostle <span class="accented">in the abstract - there</span> has been a creation of a new man; but concretely, we have to conform to the Divine creation, in respect of righteousness and holiness; righteousness denoting personal uprightness and fidelity to all social duties; holiness, the state of the spirit toward God. The last words, "of truth," denote the relation of righteousness and holiness to the truth. The words are opposed to "of deceit" in ver. 22. Lust is bred of deceit, but righteousness and holiness of truth. They never deceive, never disappoint, are solid to the end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 The apostle charged the Ephesians in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus, that having professed the gospel, they should not be as the unconverted Gentiles, who walked in vain fancies and carnal affections. Do not men, on every side, walk in the vanity of their minds? Must not we then urge the distinction between real and nominal Christians? They were void of all saving knowledge; they sat in darkness, and loved it rather than light. They had a dislike and hatred to a life of holiness, which is not only the way of life God requires and approves, and by which we live to him, but which has some likeness to God himself in his purity, righteousness, truth, and goodness. The truth of Christ appears in its beauty and power, when it appears as in Jesus. The corrupt nature is called a man; like the human body, it is of divers parts, supporting and strengthening one another. Sinful desires are deceitful lusts; they promise men happiness, but render them more miserable; and bring them to destruction, if not subdued and mortified. These therefore must be put off, as an old garment, a filthy garment; they must be subdued and mortified. But it is not enough to shake off corrupt principles; we must have gracious ones. By the new man, is meant the new nature, the new creature, directed by a new principle, even regenerating grace, enabling a man to lead a new life of righteousness and holiness. This is created, or brought forth by God's almighty power.</body></html>
