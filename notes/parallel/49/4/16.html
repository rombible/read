Here the two words are applied to the union of the limbs of the body, as being "jointed," and so "brought into close contact." The latter word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">By that which every joint supplieth.</span>--A paraphrastic and inaccurate rendering. It should be, <span class= "ital">by every contact with the supply</span> (of nutriment) from the head. The word employed has commonly the meaning of "joint" (as in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>), and is so used by Greek physiologists; but its original sense is abstract--the "joining" or "touching"--and this appears the simplest here. The supply (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Philippians 1:19</a>, "the supply of the Spirit") is again almost a technical word for the abundant outflow of strength and nervous energy from the head. (The corresponding verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:11</a>.) Hence the phrase seems to stand in closer connection with the "maketh increase "below than the "compacted together" above. The body grows, in every part of its complex unity, through contact with the divine supply of grace through the head.<p><span class= "bld">According to the effectual working in the measure of every part.</span>--In these words is described the method, as in the preceding word the source, of the growth. The "effectiveness" of every part "in measure" (according, that is, to its right capacity and function) is the condition of corporate growth. Such effectiveness comes from direct contact with the central energy.<p><span class= "bld">Maketh increase of the body unto the edifying </span>(<span class= "ital">the building up</span>) <span class= "bld">of itself in love.</span>--Here, lastly, we have the function of the body itself. It is knit together by its divine organisation; it is sustained by the supply from the head; its several parts are kept in life by that supply; but it grows as a whole and builds itself up by the uniting and vivifying power of love, which is the "bond of perfectness." (Just so St. Paul says of the individual, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>, "Charity edifieth.") Truth is, no doubt, the basis of unity; but love is its vital power, at once keeping together all who are united, and drawing in those who are as yet separated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth.</span> The relation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> in this verse to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 15 is to be noted - growing up vitally <span class="accented">into</span> him, the body derives vital substance <span class="accented">from</span> him. Not, however, in a mere <span class="accented">individual</span> sense, but as an organization, the parts being adapted and articulated to one another (this process being continuous; see present participles, (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). In the Church there are babes in Christ, also young men and old men; some are clear in intellect, some strong in faith, some warm in love, some excel in passive virtues, some in active; but in a well-ordered Church these should be getting jointed together, and learning to work with and for one another, no one despising gifts which he has not but another has; in tiffs sense, there ought to be a spiritual communism, for all are one spiritual body. But spiritual communism does not involve social communism or even social equality, nor will social distinctions be obliterated in a pure Church, except so far as they hinder spiritual communion. <span class="cmt_word">According to the energy in the measure</span> (or, <span class="accented">proportion</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of each individual part.</span> This clause seems to be most naturally connected with what follows. In the fit framing of the body, channels as it were are laid for the propagation and working of the vital force throughout the body; this force is not alike, but of various amount in the different parts; some members have much of it, some little, but the measure of this vital three regulates the growth. <span class="cmt_word">Carries on the growth of the body.</span> The middle voice, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, indicates that it is a growth from within, while depending on the energy furnished by Christ. <span class="cmt_word">For building up of itself in love.</span> This is the end, <span class="accented">so far as the body itself is concerned</span>, though, of course, the completed spiritual body, like the completed natural body, has work to do outside itself. In a healthy Church there is a continual work of building up: construction, not destruction, is its proper business - promoting peace, purity, prayerfulness, trust, activity in the work of the Lord, but all in love, the absence of which makes winter instead of summer, declension instead of progress, death instead of life. In illustration of the various measure of grace, and yet its real efficiency in all the members of the Church, Eadie says, "No member or ordinance is superfluous. The widow's mite was commended by him who sat over against the treasury. Solomon built a temple. Joseph provided a tomb. Mary the mother gave birth to the child, and the other Marys wrapped the corpse in spices. Lydia entertained the apostle, and Phoebe carried an Epistle of old, the princes and heroes went to the field, and wise-hearted women did spin. While Joshua fought, Moses prayed. The snuffers and trays were as necessary as the magnificent lampstand.... The result is that the Church is built up, for love is the element of spiritual progress. That love fills the renewed nature." The Church has been defined as an institution that has truth for its nourishment, love for its atmosphere, and Christ for its Head. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.</body></html>
