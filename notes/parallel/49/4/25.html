Truth is the first condition of the mutual confidence which is the basis of all unity. Hence it is the first duty of that "membership one of another," which follows from our being "one body in Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm" title="So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.">Romans 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.htm" title="Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.">1Corinthians 12:27</a>). No doubt it is also the first duty to our own humanity, and to the God "who hateth a lie." But these views, though true in themselves, would not be relevant to St. Paul's great subject here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>. - RAGS OF THE OLD MAN AND ROBES OF THE NEW. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak every man truth with his neighbor.</span> Lying or falsehood is pre-eminently a heathen vice, as missionaries in India and other countries abundantly testify. It is an attribute of fallen humanity: "They go astray from the womb, speaking lies;" and one of the earliest vices that appear in children is deceit. Not only is it God's will and command that we speak the truth, but it is peculiarly incumbent on Christians as children of the light, as followers of him who is the Truth, as having renounced the devil, who is the father of lies. Another reason is added. <span class="cmt_word">For ye are members one of another.</span> Falsehood is always designed to mislead; but to deceive our own members is emphatically wicked. Says Chrysostom (quoted by Eddie), "Let not the eye lie to the foot, nor the foot to the eye. If there be a deep pit, and its mouth, covered with reeds, shall present to the eye the appearance of solid ground, will not the eye use the foot to ascertain whether it is hollow underneath or whether it is firm and resists? Will the foot tell a lie, and not the truth as it is? And what, again, if the eye were to spy a serpent or a wild beast, will it lie to the foot?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:25-28 Notice the particulars wherewith we should adorn our Christian profession. Take heed of every thing contrary to truth. No longer flatter or deceive others. God's people are children who will not lie, who dare not lie, who hate and abhor lying. Take heed of anger and ungoverned passions. If there is just occasion to express displeasure at what is wrong, and to reprove, see that it be without sin. We give place to the devil, when the first motions of sin are not grievous to our souls; when we consent to them; and when we repeat an evil deed. This teaches that as sin, if yielded unto, lets in the devil upon us, we are to resist it, keeping from all appearance of evil. Idleness makes thieves. Those who will not work, expose themselves to temptations to steal. Men ought to be industrious, that they may do some good, and that they may be kept from temptation. They must labour, not only that they may live honestly, but that they may have to give to the wants of others. What then must we think of those called Christians, who grow rich by fraud, oppression, and deceitful practices! Alms, to be accepted of God, must not be gained by unrighteousness and robbery, but by honesty and industry. God hates robbery for burnt-offerings.</body></html>
