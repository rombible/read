It opens with a striking contrast of the past and the present--the life of the heathen in its "vanity," with the two-fold result of blindness and callousness of soul; and the Christian life, which has in learning Christ found the secret of regeneration.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">This I say therefore.</span>--The phrase "This I say" seems to be used by St. Paul in returning (so to speak) from some lofty aspiration or profound reasoning, in which some might not be able to follow him, to a solid, practical ground, which all may tread. (See, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1Corinthians 15:50</a>.) Here he is not content to use this phrase simply, but he enforces it by the solemnity of the adjuration "I testify" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-26.htm" title="Why I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.">Acts 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm" title="For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.">Galatians 5:3</a>), which properly means, "I call God to witness the truth of what I say"--a phrase found in express terms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:">1Thessalonians 2:5</a>. Nor was even this enough, for he adds "in the Lord"--that is, in the name, authority, and spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. The whole form is therefore one of peculiar force and solemnity.<p><span class= "bld">The vanity of their mind.</span>--In these words St. Paul describes the fundamental condition of heathenism. The "mind," that is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>), the "inner man"--the spiritual intuition of invisible principles of truth and right, which is the true humanity--has become "subject to vanity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,">Romans 8:20</a>),--the vanity of which the Book of Ecclesiastes so often speaks. In losing the living conception of a living God, it has lost also the conception of the true object and perfection of human life; and so wanders on aimless, hopeless, reckless, as in a dream. With what absolute fidelity St. Paul describes the heathen world of his day, its history and its literature alike testify. Compare with the whole passage the picture drawn in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21-32</a>, "They became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened," &c. The difference is that in the latter passage the prominent idea is mainly of "judicial blindness," sent by God as a penalty on wilful apostasy from Him, whereas here St. Paul rather dwells on self-chosen blindness and hardness of heart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-24.</span> - CONSTRASTED PRINCIPLES OF GENTILE AND CHRISTIAN CHARACTER. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord.</span> There is no sign of the apostle, when he comes to the practical part of his Epistle, deeming it of less importance than the doctrinal. The formula is very expressive; the apostle sinks his personality, and brings forward Christ as the Exhorter<span class="cmt_word">. That ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk.</span> First, he indicates what they are <span class="accented">not</span> to be. "Be not conformed to this world." In four particulars they are to be different from Gentiles. The first of these is <span class="cmt_word">in the vanity of their mind</span>. The allusion is to their frivolous, empty aims in life, and their unfixed, unsettled impulses. The Gentiles were chasing shadows, blowing bubbles, doing anything to make time pass agreeably; not considering or knowing either what they were, or whence they came, or whither they were going. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 The apostle charged the Ephesians in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus, that having professed the gospel, they should not be as the unconverted Gentiles, who walked in vain fancies and carnal affections. Do not men, on every side, walk in the vanity of their minds? Must not we then urge the distinction between real and nominal Christians? They were void of all saving knowledge; they sat in darkness, and loved it rather than light. They had a dislike and hatred to a life of holiness, which is not only the way of life God requires and approves, and by which we live to him, but which has some likeness to God himself in his purity, righteousness, truth, and goodness. The truth of Christ appears in its beauty and power, when it appears as in Jesus. The corrupt nature is called a man; like the human body, it is of divers parts, supporting and strengthening one another. Sinful desires are deceitful lusts; they promise men happiness, but render them more miserable; and bring them to destruction, if not subdued and mortified. These therefore must be put off, as an old garment, a filthy garment; they must be subdued and mortified. But it is not enough to shake off corrupt principles; we must have gracious ones. By the new man, is meant the new nature, the new creature, directed by a new principle, even regenerating grace, enabling a man to lead a new life of righteousness and holiness. This is created, or brought forth by God's almighty power.</body></html>
