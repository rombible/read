The very change from the second person to the third person shows it to be a free quotation; and this is made far more evident by the remarkable variation from the text of the original, which runs, <span class= "ital">Thou receivedst gifts in man</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>probably, "among men;" and adds, "even the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them"--a clause which (from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.">Ephesians 4:29-31</a>) we may suppose to refer to the homage of the heathen to the Lord Jehovah. Now, it has been noted that the word "received" is used constantly for "receiving," or "fetching," for another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-9.htm" title="And he said to him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.">Genesis 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm" title="And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant. And they said, So do, as you have said.">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-13.htm" title="And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.">Genesis 27:13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al</span>.); and it appears that the Chaldee Targum actually has here, as a gloss: "Thou hast given gifts to the sons of men," interpreting the words, curiously enough, of Moses as a mediator between God and man. The psalm also was recognised as a Messianic psalm, foreshadowing the dwelling of "God with us" in the universal kingdom of the true Mediator. St. Paul accordingly uses it with a bold variation suiting his context. The key to this use is found in the truth enunciated of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>, that "being by the right hand of God exalted, and <span class= "ital">having received</span> of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, <span class= "ital">He hath shed forth this."</span> Our Lord, as the Head of humanity, receives only in order to give. From the means, therefore, the Apostle passes to the end.<p><span class= "bld">He led captivity captive.</span>--The modern use of these words as describing our Lord's triumph over the power of evil, hitherto triumphant over man, and so giving freedom by leading captive the power of captivity, although in itself profoundly true, is not supported by the original, in which it is simply used for "a body of captives." St. Paul's use of it here is probably best interpreted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>, where it is said of the "principalities and powers"--the powers of sin and death--that "He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross." (See Note on this passage.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high he led captivity captive, and received gifts for men.</span> The speaker is God, the author of Scripture, and the place is the sixty-eighth psalm. That psalm is a psalm of triumph, where the placing of the ark on Zion is celebrated as if it had been a great victory. As this quotation shows, the psalm in its deepest sense is Messianic, celebrating the victory of Christ. The substance rather than the words of the passage are given, for the second person ("thou hast ascended," etc.) is changed into the third; and whereas in the psalm it is said, "gave gifts <span class="accented">to</span> men," as modified by the apostle it is said, "received gifts for men." As in a literal triumph, the chiefs of the enemy's army are led captive, so the powers of darkness were led captive by Christ (captivity, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, denotes <span class="accented">prisoners</span>); and as on occasion of a triumph the spoils of the enemy are made over to the conqueror, who again gives them away among the soldiers and people, so gifts were given to Christ after his triumph to be given by him to his Church. We must not force the analogy too far: the point is simply this - as a conqueror at a triumph gets gifts to distribute, so Christ, on his resurrection and ascension, got the Holy Spirit to bestow on his Church (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.</body></html>
