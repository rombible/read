But this communion with God in Christ being "the life eternal," the Holy Ghost, by making it effectual alike to the Church and to the individual soul, is the "Lord and Giver of Life." Hence, His presence is spoken of as being to the body of Christ what the spirit is to the natural body--the uniting and vivifying power for all its members. Under the same idea we have (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:13</a>), as a description of the first entrance into the Church of Christ, "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body . . . and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."<p><span class= "bld">Even as ye are</span> (or rather, <span class= "ital">were</span>) <span class= "bld">called in one hope of your calling.</span>--The connection, though not at first obvious, is clear on consideration. Since the grace of the Holy Spirit is not only the "seal" of regeneration, but also the "earnest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>) of future perfection, the mention of the one Spirit suggests naturally the "hope of our calling" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the perfect unity of heaven). In this, in spite of all natural and spiritual inequalities, and in spite even of our divisions and strifes upon earth, all Christians are still actually one. Hence the communion of saints is perhaps most clearly realised in the times of high spiritual aspiration, and in the near presence of death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - WHEREIN UNITY CONSISTS - SEVEN PARTICULARS. There is one body (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>). The Church is an organic whole, of which believers are the members, and Christ the Head, supplying the vitalizing power: The real body, being constituted by vital union with Christ, is not synonymous with any single outward society. <span class="cmt_word">One Spirit</span>; viz. the Holy Spirit, who alone applies the redemption of Christ, and works in the members of the Church the graces of the new creation. <span class="cmt_word">As ye also were called in one hope of your calling.</span> This is one of the re-suits of the Spirit's work; when the Spirit called you he inspired you all with one hope, and this one hope was involved in the very essence of your calling (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, "Looking for the blessed hope, even the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ"). To all believers the Spirit imparted this one blessed hope. <span class="cmt_word">One Lord</span>; Jesus Christ, unique and beyond comparison: as Teacher, all hang on his words; as Master, all own his supreme authority; to his example all refer as the standard; his likeness all covet as the highest excellence (where Mary is worshipped, though nominally you have but one Lord, virtually you have two). <span class="cmt_word">One faith</span>; not objective in the sense of creed, but as denoting the one instrument of receiving salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>), the one belief in the one Savior by which we are justified, adopted, and in other ways blessed. <span class="cmt_word">One baptism</span>. One initiatory rite admitting into the visible Church - baptism in name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, symbolic of the washing of regeneration, the one way of entering the Church invisible. <span class="cmt_word">One God and Father of all.</span> We rise now to the fountain of Godhead, the one supreme Being with whom all have to do, the only Being who is or can be the Father of us all; who can be to us what is implied in the name "Father," who, so love and grace can satisfy our hearts. <span class="cmt_word">Who is over all</span>; the supreme and only Potentate, exercising undivided jurisdiction, "doing according to his will in the armies of heaven." etc. <span class="cmt_word">And through all</span>; pervading the whole universe, sustaining and ruling it, not dwelling apart from his works, but pervading them; not, however, in any pantheistical sense, but as a personal God, whose essence is separate from his works. <span class="cmt_word">And in all.</span> A closer and more abiding influence; he dwells in them, and walks in them, molding their inner being, and filling them with his own light and love. Some commentators of mark have tried to find a reference to each of the persons of the Godhead in the three prepositions <span class="accented">over</span>, <span class="accented">through</span>, and <span class="accented">by</span>, but this seems a strained view. The three persons, however, appear clearly in the seven elements of unity, but, as before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a>), in the reverse of the common order - first, the Spirit; second, the Son; and third, the Father. These seven elements constitute the true rarity of the Church. It is out of the question to identify the Church which is thus one, with any external organization like the Roman Catholic Church. How many millions have been connected with it who have notoriously been destitute of the one hope, the one Spirit, the one Father! It is of the invisible Church the apostle speaks, and his exhortation is, seeing that this blessed sevenfold unity is the unity wrought by the Holy Spirit, maintain that unity; maintain the manifestation of it; give no occasion to any one to say that there is no such unity - that the Holy Ghost is a Spirit of confusion and not a Spirit of order and unity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Nothing is pressed more earnestly in the Scriptures, than to walk as becomes those called to Christ's kingdom and glory. By lowliness, understand humility, which is opposed to pride. By meekness, that excellent disposition of soul, which makes men unwilling to provoke, and not easily to be provoked or offended. We find much in ourselves for which we can hardly forgive ourselves; therefore we must not be surprised if we find in others that which we think it hard to forgive. There is one Christ in whom all believers hope, and one heaven they are all hoping for; therefore they should be of one heart. They had all one faith, as to its object, Author, nature, and power. They all believed the same as to the great truths of religion; they had all been admitted into the church by one baptism, with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as the sign of regeneration. In all believers God the Father dwells, as in his holy temple, by his Spirit and special grace.</body></html>
