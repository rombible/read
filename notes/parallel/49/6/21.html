There is evidently an allusion to Tychicus' similar mission to Colossae; and we may, perhaps, also trace some indication of a generality of scope in this Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">Tychicus</span> is first mentioned with Trophimus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>, as being "of Asia," and accompanying St. Paul on his last journey from Corinth to Asia, although he is not, like Trophimus, actually named as with the Apostle at Jerusalem. It is highly probable that he was one of the "messengers of the churches" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18-23</a>, as sent to bear the alms to Jerusalem. We now find him again with St. Paul, and made by him the bearer of this Epistle and the Epistle to the Colossians. Lastly, he is alluded <span class= "ital">to</span> as still his companion in the interval between the first and second captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm" title="To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness to all men.">Titus 3:2</a>), and in the second captivity is despatched once more to Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm" title="And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.">2Timothy 4:12</a>). It is evident that he well deserved the title of a "faithful minister" to the Apostle; and we note (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2Timothy 4:11-12</a>) that the command to bring Mark, as being "profitable for ministration" is immediately connected with the remark, "Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus."<p><span class= "bld">A faithful minister.</span>--The word "minister" is <span class= "ital">diaconus;</span> but there is no reason to think that it is used technically to describe Tychicus as a deacon. In the Colossian Epistle the words "and fellowservant" are added, showing clearly that the word "minister" refers only to ministration to St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - MISSION OF TYCHICUS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do.</span> Having referred to his captivity, he thought it natural for the Ephesians to desire more information about him, how he did or fared in his captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord.</span> Nothing more is known of him than that (with Trophimus) he was a man of Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), who accompanied Paul when traveling from Macedonia to Asia, and was sent by him to various Churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>). The two qualities by which he is noted, lovableness and fidelity, have not only served to embalm his name, but show that he had much of Paul's own character. <span class="cmt_word">Shall make known to you all things.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 The gospel was a mystery till made known by Divine revelation; and it is the work of Christ's ministers to declare it. The best and most eminent ministers need the prayers of believers. Those particularly should be prayed for, who are exposed to great hardships and perils in their work. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun. And all grace and blessings come to the saints from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Grace, that is, the favour of God; and all good, spiritual and temporal, which is from it, is and shall be with all those who thus love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and with them only.</body></html>
