But it. is impossible not to notice the difference between the generality of the terms here used ("the brethren," and "all who love the Lord Jesus Christ") and the personal "you" of all the other Epistles--a difference which would be inexplicable if this Epistle were addressed to the well-known and loved Church of Ephesus alone.<p>Peace seems especially dwelt upon in the Epistles of the Captivity, of which the Epistle to Philippi contains (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>) the fullest description of the "peace of God which passeth all understanding." It is naturally connected here with love (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-15.htm" title=" And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.">Colossians 3:15-16</a>)--a "love with faith," "making perfect" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>) the faith which St. Paul takes for granted as being in them. For peace is first with God, in the thankful receiving of His mercy; from this naturally arises "love with faith" towards Him; and out of this, again, peace and love towards men, in the conviction that, "if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm" title="Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.">1John 4:11</a>). All these are gifts from "God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - CLOSING BENEDICTION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peace be to the brethren.</span> There is a double invocation of blessing - to the brethren, and to all that love the Lord. "The brethren" must mean the members of the Church addressed, with special reference to the amalgamation in one body of Jews and Gentiles, or to the one family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm">Ephesians 3:15</a>) in which they were brethren, Peace is the echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a>, and denotes the apostle's desire for the continuance among them of the peace with God to which they had been admitted, as well as the prevalence of peace in every sense of the word. <span class="cmt_word">And love with faith.</span> "Love" <span class="accented">in</span> the widest sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17, 19</a>) - the love of Christ to them, their love to Christ, and their love to one another; and love is coupled with faith, because faith is the companion of love, they are in the closest relation to each other. Faith in Christ receives him as he is offered, in all his love and goodness; it sees his loving face, and is changed into the same image. <span class="cmt_word">From God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 The gospel was a mystery till made known by Divine revelation; and it is the work of Christ's ministers to declare it. The best and most eminent ministers need the prayers of believers. Those particularly should be prayed for, who are exposed to great hardships and perils in their work. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun. And all grace and blessings come to the saints from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Grace, that is, the favour of God; and all good, spiritual and temporal, which is from it, is and shall be with all those who thus love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and with them only.</body></html>
