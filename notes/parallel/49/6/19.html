The "opening the mouth"--an expression always used of solemn and deliberate utterance--seems taken for granted. What the Apostle desires them to pray for is that "word may be given him"--"the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, by the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:8</a>), according to our Lord's promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-19.htm" title="But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.">Matthew 10:19-20</a>), "It shall be given you in the same hour what you shall speak; for it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you." Then he adds as a consequence of this--<span class= "ital">to make known in plainness of speech the mystery of the gospel.</span> For to make known a mystery in simplicity needs not only boldness to speak, but also the knowledge of the true word of God.<p><span class= "bld">The mystery of the gospel.</span>--The word "gospel" being used emphatically is, of course, the mystery of the new and universal grace of God to the Gentiles of which he speaks at large in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1-10</a>.

To open the mouth denotes an authoritative act of teaching (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-2.htm">Matthew 5:2</a>); on such occasions he especially desired <span class="accented">boldness</span>, not stormy vehemence, but earnestness, fearlessness in making known the destination of the gospel, once secret, now designed for all (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2</a>.). Boldness was needed because the message was so hateful to some and so contemptible to others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 The gospel was a mystery till made known by Divine revelation; and it is the work of Christ's ministers to declare it. The best and most eminent ministers need the prayers of believers. Those particularly should be prayed for, who are exposed to great hardships and perils in their work. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun. And all grace and blessings come to the saints from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Grace, that is, the favour of God; and all good, spiritual and temporal, which is from it, is and shall be with all those who thus love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and with them only.</body></html>
