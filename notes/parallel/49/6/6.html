The word "eyeservice" (used here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>) is peculiar to St. Paul, and to these passages; the word "menpleasers" is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but is used in the LXX.; and the antithesis of "pleasing men" and "pleasing God "is not unfrequent with St. Paul. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1Thessalonians 2:4</a>.) To a slave, looking on his master's authority as mere power imposed by the cruel laws of man, this "eyeservice" is found to be an all but irresistible temptation. It is only when he looks on himself as "the slave of Christ"--who Himself "took on Him the form of a slave" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Philippians 2:7</a>) in order to work out the will of God in a sinful world, and to redeem all men from bondage--that he can possibly serve from the heart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not in the spirit of eye-service, as men-pleasers; but as the bond-servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.</span> Exegetical of the last exhortation, with a negative and a positive clause, according to the apostle's frequent practice (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14, 15, 25, 28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18, 27, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>). Eye-service and men-pleasing have reference only to what will pass muster in the world; Christians must go deeper, as bound to Christ's service by the great claim of redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>), and remembering that "man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The will of God is our great standard, and our daily prayer is, "Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven." In heaven it is done "from the heart." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:5-9 The duty of servants is summed up in one word, obedience. The servants of old were generally slaves. The apostles were to teach servants and masters their duties, in doing which evils would be lessened, till slavery should be rooted out by the influence of Christianity. Servants are to reverence those over them. They are to be sincere; not pretending obedience when they mean to disobey, but serving faithfully. And they must serve their masters not only when their master's eye is upon them; but must be strict in the discharge of their duty, when he is absent and out of the way. Steady regard to the Lord Jesus Christ will make men faithful and sincere in every station, not grudgingly or by constraint, but from a principle of love to the masters and their concerns. This makes service easy to them, pleasing to their masters, and acceptable to the Lord Christ. God will reward even the meanest drudgery done from a sense of duty, and with a view to glorify him. Here is the duty of masters. Act after the same manner. Be just to servants, as you expect they should be to you; show the like good-will and concern for them, and be careful herein to approve yourselves to God. Be not tyrannical and overbearing. You have a Master to obey, and you and they are but fellow-servants in respect to Christ Jesus. If masters and servants would consider their duties to God, and the account they must shortly give to him, they would be more mindful of their duty to each other, and thus families would be more orderly and happy.</body></html>
