But it is still the first; the Decalogue being itself the introduction to the Law, in which similar promises are repeated again and again.<p>(2) (18) <span class= "bld">Praying always with all prayer and Supplication.</span>--In this verse the metaphor gives place to direct exhortation, unless, indeed, in the word "watch" there still lingers some reference to the soldier on guard. "Prayer" is the general word for "worship," appropriated to God alone; "supplication," used also towards man, is one element of such worship--the asking what we need from God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Philippians 4:6</a> we have first the general word "prayer," and then the two chief elements of worship, <span class= "ital">"</span>supplication with thanksgiving." It is by prayer that all the heavenly armour is put on.<p><span class= "bld">In the Spirit.</span>--That is, "in the Spirit of God" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>). Compare the relation of prayer to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26-27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And watching thereunto with all perseverance.</span>--These words in themselves obviously supply the other part of our Lord's command, "Watch and pray," naturally apposite to the consideration of the Christian warfare. "Perseverance" implies exertion, holding out against fatigue and difficulty. The corresponding verb is used in relation to all kinds of spiritual labour (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm" title="And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.">Acts 2:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-4.htm" title="But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-13.htm" title="Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.">Acts 8:13</a>); but especially in connection with prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-12.htm" title="Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;">Romans 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm" title=" Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;">Colossians 4:2</a>). Perhaps from this frequent connection St. Paul is induced to add to it "supplication," and this time "for all saints," so leading on to his usual request for the prayers of his brethren. For this he is willing to sacrifice some part of the perfect appropriateness of idea; since the whole picture hitherto has been of the fight, waged by each for himself (although side by side with others), in the combined power of watchfulness and prayer for God's help.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise).</span> The exhortation, based on natural morality (ver. 1), is here confirmed from the Decalogue. "Honor" is higher than obedience (ver. 1); it is the regard due to those who, by Divine appointment, are above us, and to whom our most respectful consideration is due. Father and mother, though not quite on a footing of equality in their relation to each other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>), are equal as objects of honor and obedience to their children. It is assumed here that they are Christians; where one was a Christian and not the ether, the duty would be modified. But in these succinct verses the apostle lays down general rules, and does not complicate his exhortations with exceptions. The latter part of the verse contains a special reason for the precept; it is the first commandment <span class="accented">with a promise attached</span>. But obviously the apostle meant more than this; for as in ver. I he had affirmed the duty to be one of natural religion, so here he means to add that it is also part of <span class="accented">the revealed will</span> of God - it is one of the commandments; but still further, it is the first commandment <span class="accented">with a promise</span>. It may, perhaps, be said that this is appealing, not to the higher, but to the lower part of our nature - to our selfishness, not our goodness; but it is not an appeal to one part of our nature to the exclusion of the rest; it is an appeal <span class="accented">to our whole nature</span>, for it is a part of our nature to expect that in the end virtue will be rewarded and vice punished. In the case of children it is difficult to look far forward; the rewards and the punishments, to be influential, must be within the ken of vision, as it were; therefore it is quite suitable that, in writing to them, the apostle should lay emphasis on a promise which had its special fulfillment in the life that now is. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-4 The great duty of children is, to obey their parents. That obedience includes inward reverence, as well as outward acts, and in every age prosperity has attended those distinguished for obedience to parents. The duty of parents. Be not impatient; use no unreasonable severities. Deal prudently and wisely with children; convince their judgements and work upon their reason. Bring them up well; under proper and compassionate correction; and in the knowledge of the duty God requires. Often is this duty neglected, even among professors of the gospel. Many set their children against religion; but this does not excuse the children's disobedience, though it may be awfully occasion it. God alone can change the heart, yet he gives his blessing to the good lessons and examples of parents, and answers their prayers. But those, whose chief anxiety is that their children should be rich and accomplished, whatever becomes of their souls, must not look for the blessing of God.</body></html>
