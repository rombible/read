It occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-4.htm" title="Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.">Mark 5:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-29.htm" title="(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)">Luke 8:29</a>, where it is distinguished from a "fetter" properly so called, as binding the feet, and therefore obviously signifies a "manacle" binding the hand. Both are included (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-29.htm" title="(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)">Luke 8:29</a>) in the general word "bonds." The allusion is undoubtedly to the custom of chaining the prisoner by the hand to the soldier who kept him. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-6.htm" title="And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.">Acts 12:6</a> we read that Peter "was sleeping between two soldiers," and therefore "bound with two manacles;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-33.htm" title="Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.">Acts 21:33</a> that a similar precaution was used on the first apprehension of St. Paul. Here the singular number is probably to be understood literally. St. Paul was free except for the one chain, which the soldier was responsible for holding, and perhaps did not always think it needful to hold. That chain he seems to speak of as the badge of his ambassadorial dignity. To ambassadors, indeed, it belongs to be safe from imprisonment; but it was his greater glory to wear the chain for Christ.<p><span class= "bld">That therein . . .</span>--This is simply an enforcement of the previous phrase, in "plainness of speech." The same word is used, and with the same signification of simplicity, as well as boldness, which (St. Paul here adds) alone befits his office.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For which I am an ambassador in chains.</span> Thereby not only physically helpless, but in danger of being subdued into tameness, the ordinary effect of captivity, and thus reduced to a spirit not befitting the bearer of a great message from the King of kings. <span class="cmt_word">That in it</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the matter of it, of the gospel - I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 The gospel was a mystery till made known by Divine revelation; and it is the work of Christ's ministers to declare it. The best and most eminent ministers need the prayers of believers. Those particularly should be prayed for, who are exposed to great hardships and perils in their work. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun. And all grace and blessings come to the saints from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Grace, that is, the favour of God; and all good, spiritual and temporal, which is from it, is and shall be with all those who thus love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and with them only.</body></html>
