What is "the preparation of the gospel of peace"? (1) It has seemed to many natural to illustrate this phrase by the celebrated passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm" title="How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace; that brings good tidings of good, that publishes salvation; that said to Zion, Your God reigns!">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm" title="And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!">Romans 10:15</a>), "How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace"; and to interpret, "shod in (or, <span class= "ital">for</span>) preparing the way of the gospel of peace." But this is inappropriate to the whole context; for each piece of armour is a quality, and not a function. (2) Again, the word rendered "preparation," is found nowhere else in the New Testament; in the LXX. we find it used in its most obvious sense of "preparedness" or "readiness" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-17.htm" title="LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble: you will prepare their heart, you will cause your ear to hear:">Psalm 10:17</a>, "preparedness of heart," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-3.htm" title="And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?">Nehemiah 2:3</a>); but this sense will not suit the passage, for "readiness of the gospel of peace" is hardly intelligible, and certainly is not a quality of the soul. (3) We come therefore, at last, to a derivative and improper sense, which, however, is most frequently used in the LXX., viz., "foundation" or "base," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-7.htm" title="But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:">Daniel 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-6.htm" title="The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and twelve.">Ezra 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-3.htm" title="And they set the altar on his bases; for fear was on them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon to the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.">Ezra 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-10.htm" title="Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?">Zechariah 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-14.htm" title="LORD, why cast you off my soul? why hide you your face from me?">Psalm 88:14</a>. The context certainly suggests that we should explain the word here by this last Hellenistic use, as signifying simply the "footing" or "basis." The <span class= "ital">calig?, </span>or sandals, of the Roman soldiers were heavy sandals studded with hobnails, to give a secure foothold to those who would stand firm. St. Paul identifies these with the firm "footing of the gospel of peace." Clearly the word "peace" is here emphatic. The gospel is looked upon as the declaration of "peace on earth, goodwill towards men." The firm stand on this message is the firm assurance of God's love. In this, and this alone, we stand. No doubt, this is in some sense faith, but faith of a wholly different character from the defensive faith of the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.</span> The metaphor becomes somewhat difficult to follow; the feet have to be shod or armed as with military sandals, and the sandal is the <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or preparedness of, or caused by, the gospel of peace. The idea seems to be that the mind is to be steadied, kept from fear and flutter, by means of the good news of peace - the good news that we are at peace with God; and "if God be for us, who can be against us?" The Roman sandal was furnished with nails that gripped the ground firmly, even when it was sloping or slippery; so the good news of peace keeps us upright and firm. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:10-18 Spiritual strength and courage are needed for our spiritual warfare and suffering. Those who would prove themselves to have true grace, must aim at all grace; and put on the whole armour of God, which he prepares and bestows. The Christian armour is made to be worn; and there is no putting off our armour till we have done our warfare, and finished our course. The combat is not against human enemies, nor against our own corrupt nature only; we have to do with an enemy who has a thousand ways of beguiling unstable souls. The devils assault us in the things that belong to our souls, and labour to deface the heavenly image in our hearts. We must resolve by God's grace, not to yield to Satan. Resist him, and he will flee. If we give way, he will get ground. If we distrust either our cause, or our Leader, or our armour, we give him advantage. The different parts of the armour of heavy-armed soldiers, who had to sustain the fiercest assaults of the enemy, are here described. There is none for the back; nothing to defend those who turn back in the Christian warfare. Truth, or sincerity, is the girdle. This girds on all the other pieces of our armour, and is first mentioned. There can be no religion without sincerity. The righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, is a breastplate against the arrows of Divine wrath. The righteousness of Christ implanted in us, fortifies the heart against the attacks of Satan. Resolution must be as greaves, or armour to our legs; and to stand their ground or to march forward in rugged paths, the feet must be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Motives to obedience, amidst trials, must be drawn from a clear knowledge of the gospel. Faith is all in all in an hour of temptation. Faith, as relying on unseen objects, receiving Christ and the benefits of redemption, and so deriving grace from him, is like a shield, a defence every way. The devil is the wicked one. Violent temptations, by which the soul is set on fire of hell, are darts Satan shoots at us. Also, hard thoughts of God, and as to ourselves. Faith applying the word of God and the grace of Christ, quenches the darts of temptation. Salvation must be our helmet. A good hope of salvation, a Scriptural expectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from being defiled by Satan. To the Christian armed for defense in battle, the apostle recommends only one weapon of attack; but it is enough, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armour. There are other duties of religion, and of our stations in the world, but we must keep up times of prayer. Though set and solemn prayer may not be seasonable when other duties are to be done, yet short pious prayers darted out, always are so. We must use holy thoughts in our ordinary course. A vain heart will be vain in prayer. We must pray with all kinds of prayer, public, private, and secret; social and solitary; solemn and sudden: with all the parts of prayer; confession of sin, petition for mercy, and thanksgiving for favours received. And we must do it by the grace of God the Holy Spirit, in dependence on, and according to, his teaching. We must preserve in particular requests, notwithstanding discouragements. We must pray, not for ourselves only, but for all saints. Our enemies are mighty, and we are without strength, but our Redeemer is almighty, and in the power of his mighty we may overcome. Wherefore we must stir up ourselves. Have not we, when God has called, often neglected to answer? Let us think upon these things, and continue our prayers with patience.</body></html>
