We are said not to put on, but to "take" (or rather, <span class= "ital">receive</span>)--a word specially appropriate to "salvation."<p><span class= "bld">The helmet of salvation.</span>--The word here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-30.htm" title="For my eyes have seen your salvation,">Luke 2:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-6.htm" title="And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.">Luke 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-28.htm" title="Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.">Acts 28:28</a>) rendered "salvation," is not the word commonly so rendered in the New Testament. It is, indeed, not "salvation" in the abstract, but a general expression for "that which tends to salvation." But it occurs in the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm" title="For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.">Isaiah 59:17</a>, which seems obviously referred to, "He put" a helmet of salvation upon his head." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1Thessalonians 5:8</a>, where the breastplate is "of faith and love," the helmet supplies the third member of the triad of Christian graces in "<span class= "ital">the hope</span> of salvation." Here the metaphor is probably somewhat different. The helmet guarding the head, the most noble and vital part, is "salvation" in the concrete--all that is of the Saviour, all that makes up our "state of salvation" by His atonement and grace--received in earnest now, hoped for in perfection hereafter.<p><span class= "bld">The sword of the</span> <span class= "bld">Spirit, which is the word of God.</span>--In this we pass to the one offensive weapon of the Christian, "the sword of the Spirit"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>given by the Holy Spirit--which, like the helmet, but unlike the rest of the defensive armour, does not become a part of himself, but is absolutely of God. The passage reminds us at once of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a> : "The word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword." But there (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1Corinthians 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm" title=" Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;">Colossians 1:25</a>; 2 Tim. 2:29) the original word is the larger and deeper word (<span class= "ital">Logos</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>signifying the truth of God in itself, and gradually leading up to the ultimate sense in which our Lord Himself is the "Word of God," revealing the Godhead to man. Accordingly the work of the Word there, is that of the "engrafted Word," "to divide asunder the soul and the spirit" within. Here, on the contrary, we have another expression (<span class= "ital">Rhema</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>signifying the Word as spoken; and St. Peter (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>) defines it exactly: "The word of the Lord endureth for ever; and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you." We cannot, of course, limit it to Holy Scripture, though we naturally remember that our Lord used the Scriptures as His only weapon in the Temptation. It is the gospel of Christ, however and wherever spoken, able to put to shame and to flight the powers of evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And take the helmet of salvation.</span> This is the head-covering (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-7.htm">Psalm 140:7</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a> we read, "putting on for an helmet the hope of salvation." The glorious truth that we are saved (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5, 8</a>) appropriated, rested on, rejoiced in, will protect even so vital a part as the head, will keep us from intellectual surrender and rationalistic doubt. <span class="cmt_word">And the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</span> The sword <span class="accented">supplied by</span> the Spirit, the Word being inspired by him, and employed by the Spirit; for he enlightens us to know it, applies it to us, and teaches us to use it both defensively and offensively. Our Lord in his conflict with Satan, and also with the scribes and Pharisees, has taught us how this weapon is to be used, and with what wonderful effect. Paul, too, reasoning from the Scriptures and proving from them "that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is the Christ," or (going back to the Old Testament) the author of the hundred and nineteenth psalm, showing us how the soul is to be fed, quickened, strengthened and comforted out of God's Law, indicates the manifold use of the sword, and shows how earnestly we should study and practice this sword exercise, for our own good and the good of others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:10-18 Spiritual strength and courage are needed for our spiritual warfare and suffering. Those who would prove themselves to have true grace, must aim at all grace; and put on the whole armour of God, which he prepares and bestows. The Christian armour is made to be worn; and there is no putting off our armour till we have done our warfare, and finished our course. The combat is not against human enemies, nor against our own corrupt nature only; we have to do with an enemy who has a thousand ways of beguiling unstable souls. The devils assault us in the things that belong to our souls, and labour to deface the heavenly image in our hearts. We must resolve by God's grace, not to yield to Satan. Resist him, and he will flee. If we give way, he will get ground. If we distrust either our cause, or our Leader, or our armour, we give him advantage. The different parts of the armour of heavy-armed soldiers, who had to sustain the fiercest assaults of the enemy, are here described. There is none for the back; nothing to defend those who turn back in the Christian warfare. Truth, or sincerity, is the girdle. This girds on all the other pieces of our armour, and is first mentioned. There can be no religion without sincerity. The righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, is a breastplate against the arrows of Divine wrath. The righteousness of Christ implanted in us, fortifies the heart against the attacks of Satan. Resolution must be as greaves, or armour to our legs; and to stand their ground or to march forward in rugged paths, the feet must be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Motives to obedience, amidst trials, must be drawn from a clear knowledge of the gospel. Faith is all in all in an hour of temptation. Faith, as relying on unseen objects, receiving Christ and the benefits of redemption, and so deriving grace from him, is like a shield, a defence every way. The devil is the wicked one. Violent temptations, by which the soul is set on fire of hell, are darts Satan shoots at us. Also, hard thoughts of God, and as to ourselves. Faith applying the word of God and the grace of Christ, quenches the darts of temptation. Salvation must be our helmet. A good hope of salvation, a Scriptural expectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from being defiled by Satan. To the Christian armed for defense in battle, the apostle recommends only one weapon of attack; but it is enough, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. It subdues and mortifies evil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answers unbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, well understood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or an objection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer must fasten all the other parts of our Christian armour. There are other duties of religion, and of our stations in the world, but we must keep up times of prayer. Though set and solemn prayer may not be seasonable when other duties are to be done, yet short pious prayers darted out, always are so. We must use holy thoughts in our ordinary course. A vain heart will be vain in prayer. We must pray with all kinds of prayer, public, private, and secret; social and solitary; solemn and sudden: with all the parts of prayer; confession of sin, petition for mercy, and thanksgiving for favours received. And we must do it by the grace of God the Holy Spirit, in dependence on, and according to, his teaching. We must preserve in particular requests, notwithstanding discouragements. We must pray, not for ourselves only, but for all saints. Our enemies are mighty, and we are without strength, but our Redeemer is almighty, and in the power of his mighty we may overcome. Wherefore we must stir up ourselves. Have not we, when God has called, often neglected to answer? Let us think upon these things, and continue our prayers with patience.</body></html>
