It denotes the exasperation produced by arbitrary and unsympathetic rule.<p><span class= "bld">Nurture and admonition of the Lord.</span>--In this phrase we have the two elements of education. "Nurture" is a word signifying generally "the treatment due to a child," but by usage appropriated to practical training, or teaching by discipline; while "admonition" is the "putting children in mind" by word of instruction. It may be noted that in accordance with the characteristic sternness of ancient education, both words have a tinge of severity in them. The "nurture" of this passage is the same as the "chastening" of the famous passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-4.htm" title="You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.">Hebrews 12:4-11</a>. (Compare the cognate verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-16.htm" title="I will therefore chastise him, and release him.">Luke 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.">1Corinthians 11:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1Timothy 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-19.htm" title="As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.">Revelation 3:19</a>.) The "admonition" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a> for rebuke, and, inasmuch as it implies warning, is distinguished from teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>. In this, as in other cases, Christianity gradually softened this stern authority of the father--so strikingly exemplified in the old Roman law--by the idea suggested in the addition of the phrase "of the Lord." The children belong not to the parent only, but to Christ, taken into His arms in baptism, and sealed as His little ones. Hence the "reverence," which Juvenal enforced in theory as due to children's natural purity, become realised in Christian practice, and gradually transformed all Christian education to greater gentleness, forbearance, and love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.</span> "Fathers" is inclusive of mothers, to whom the practical administration of the household and training of the children so much belong. The first counsel on the subject is negative, and probably has respect to a common pagan habit, against which Christians needed to be put on their guard. Irritation of children was common, through loss of temper and violence in reproving them, through capricious and unsteady treatment and unreasonable commands; but more especially (what is still so common) by the parents being violently angry when the children, inconsiderately, perhaps, disturbed or annoyed them, rather than when they deliberately did wrong. All this the apostle deprecates. <span class="cmt_word">But bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord.</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are not easily defined in this connection; the former is thought to denote the discipline of training, with its appropriate rewards and punishments; the latter, instruction. Both are to be "of the Lord," such as he inspires and approves. Instilling sound principles of life, training to good habits, cautioning and protecting against moral dangers, encouraging prayer, Bible-reading, church-going, sabbath-keeping; taking pains to let them have good associates, and especially dealing with them prayerfully and earnestly, in order that they may accept Christ as their Savior and follow him, - are among the matters included in this counsel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-4 The great duty of children is, to obey their parents. That obedience includes inward reverence, as well as outward acts, and in every age prosperity has attended those distinguished for obedience to parents. The duty of parents. Be not impatient; use no unreasonable severities. Deal prudently and wisely with children; convince their judgements and work upon their reason. Bring them up well; under proper and compassionate correction; and in the knowledge of the duty God requires. Often is this duty neglected, even among professors of the gospel. Many set their children against religion; but this does not excuse the children's disobedience, though it may be awfully occasion it. God alone can change the heart, yet he gives his blessing to the good lessons and examples of parents, and answers their prayers. But those, whose chief anxiety is that their children should be rich and accomplished, whatever becomes of their souls, must not look for the blessing of God.</body></html>
