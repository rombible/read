It is distinguished (as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>) from "covetousness," or <span class= "ital">greediness.</span> "Uncleanness" is a sin against our own body and soul (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-18.htm" title="Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is without the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.">1Corinthians 6:18</a>); "covetousness" (literally, <span class= "ital">the insatiable desire for more</span>) is a sin against our neighbour. At the same time, the constant connection of the two words suggests the truth which is conveyed by the union of the two kinds of "coveting" in the Tenth Commandment, viz., that the temper of selfish and unbridled concupiscence has a two-fold direction--to the covetousness of lust, and to the covetousness of avarice--the one perhaps especially a vice of youth, and the other of old age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-21.</span> - THE WALK SUITABLE TO THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. Another of the remarkable contrasts of this Epistle; the fumes of lust are doubly odious in contact with the sweet savor of Christ's offering. <span class="cmt_word">Fornication and all impurity, or covetousness.</span> The combination of covetousness with sins of the flesh, occurring several times in the apostle's writings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>), is rather unexpected. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, covetousness, means the desire of having more, which is peculiarly true of sensual sins; but it is not coupled with them by a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, but disjoined by an <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span>, indicating something of another class. In the mind of the apostle, sensuality was inseparable from greed, unnatural craving for more, dissatisfaction with what was enough; hence the neighborhood of the two vices. <span class="cmt_word">Let it not be even named among you, as becometh saints.</span> The practice of such sins was out of the question; but even speaking of them, as matters of ordinary conversation, was unsuitable for saints; the very conversation of Christians must be pure. The exhortation bears on Christians in their social relations; had the apostle been treating of the duty of the individual, he would have urged that such sins should never be admitted even to the thoughts or the imagination. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.</body></html>
