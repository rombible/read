There the idea is of teaching: "teaching and admonishing one another;" here, simply of a natural vent for emotion, especially of thanksgiving, although probably here also "to yourselves" means "to one another," and refers, perhaps, chiefly to public worship. The well-known passage in Pliny, "Carmen dicere inter se invicem," describes alternate, possibly antiphonal, singing of such sacred music. Of the various kinds of this music, the "psalms" and "hymns" are easily distinguished. The "psalm," as the word itself implies, is music with instrumental accompaniment, and can hardly fail to refer to the Old Testament psalms, familiar in Jewish worship, and as we know, used in the first instance we have of apostolic worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24</a>). On their frequent use see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1Corinthians 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a>. The "hymn" is purely vocal music, apparently of the whole company (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-30.htm" title="And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.">Matthew 26:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-25.htm" title="And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.">Acts 16:25</a>), more especially directed to praise of God, and probably designating the new utterances of the Christian Church itself. But the interpretation of the "spiritual song," or "ode," is more difficult. It is often considered as inclusive of the other two (as etymologically it might well be), but the genius of the passage appears to make it co-ordinate, and so distinct from them. From the use of the word "song," or "ode," as applied to lyric poetry, it may perhaps be conjectured that it describes more varied and elaborate music, sung by one person only--a spiritual utterance of one for the whole congregation. In a passage of Philo (2 p. 476)--quoted by Dr. Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>--on Jewish sacred music, we read, "He who stands up sings a hymn composed in praise of God, <span class= "ital">either having made a new one for himself, </span>or using an ancient one of the poets of days gone by." The Christian counterpart of this migh<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1Corinthians 14:26</a>, a passage dealing expressly with special spiritual gifts. "Each one of you has a psalm." Evidently it might be strictly a "hymn" or "psalm," though in common usage (as here) it would be distinguished from both.<p><span class= "bld">Singing and making melody in your heart.</span>--The word rendered "making melody" is the verb corresponding to the "psalm" above, as singing to the "song." This clause is not identical but co-ordinate with the last. That described audible and public melody; this, the secret utterance of music in the soul, whether accompanying the other or distinct from it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speaking to one another.</span> Literally, this would denote antiphonal singing, but this is rather an artificial idea for so simple times. It seems here to denote one person singing one hymn, then another another, and so on; and the meetings would seem to have been for social Christian enjoyment rather than for the public worship of God. In the Epistle to the Colossians it is, "Teaching and admonishing one another with psalms," and this has more of the idea of public worship; and if it be proper to express joyful feelings in the comparatively private social gatherings of Christians, it is proper to do the same in united public worship. <span class="cmt_word">In psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.</span> The precise meaning of these terms is not easily seen; "psalms" we should naturally apply to the Old Testament psalms, but the want of the article makes the meaning more general, equivalent to "songs with the character of the psalms;" hymns, songs celebrating the praises of the Divine Being, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; "spiritual songs" or odes of a more general cast, meditative, historical, hortatory, or didactic. But these must be "spiritual," such as the Holy Spirit would lead us to use and would use with us for our good. The two clauses correspond: "be filled with the Spirit;" "speaking in spiritual songs." Receive the Spirit - pour out the Spirit; let your songs be effusions sent forth from your hearts with the aroma of the Holy Spirit. Singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Lord Jesus. Some have argued that while <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> denotes singing, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> means striking the musical instrument. But <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is so frequently used in a more general sense, that it can hardly be restricted to this meaning here. The great thought is that this musical service must not be musical only, but a service of the heart, in rendering which the heart must be in a state of worship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-21 Another remedy against sin, is care, or caution, it being impossible else to maintain purity of heart and life. Time is a talent given us by God, and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to his design. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must double our diligence for the future. Of that time which thousands on a dying bed would gladly redeem at the price of the whole world, how little do men think, and to what trifles they daily sacrifice it! People are very apt to complain of bad times; it were well if that stirred them more to redeem time. Be not unwise. Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls, show the greatest folly. Drunkenness is a sin that never goes alone, but carries men into other evils; it is a sin very provoking to God. The drunkard holds out to his family and to the world the sad spectacle of a sinner hardened beyond what is common, and hastening to perdition. When afflicted or weary, let us not seek to raise our spirits by strong drink, which is hateful and hurtful, and only ends in making sorrows more felt. But by fervent prayer let us seek to be filled with the Spirit, and to avoid whatever may grieve our gracious Comforter. All God's people have reason to sing for joy. Though we are not always singing, we should be always giving thanks; we should never want disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it, through the whole course of our lives. Always, even in trials and afflictions, and for all things; being satisfied of their loving intent, and good tendency. God keeps believers from sinning against him, and engages them to submit one to another in all he has commanded, to promote his glory, and to fulfil their duties to each other.</body></html>
