There is a similar connection of idea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/15-12.htm" title="This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.">John 15:12-13</a>, "This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." The imitation of God is in free and natural beneficence; the imitation of Christ is in that power of showing mercy, which is bought by suffering and sacrifice. He not only "loved us," but "gave Himself for us."<p><span class= "bld">An offering and a sacrifice to God,--</span>The same words, "sacrifice and offering," are found in close connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>, which is a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7</a>. Comparing these with the Hebrew words which they represent, and looking also to the etymology of the Greek words themselves, we see that the word "offering" signifies simply a gift offered to God, and is applied especially, though not exclusively, to unbloody sacrifices; while the word "sacrifice" distinctly implies the shedding of blood. Each word, when used alone, has constantly a more general sense. Thus "offering" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-18.htm" title="Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.">Hebrews 10:18</a>, for the sacrifice on the cross; while "sacrifice," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?">Acts 7:42</a>, is made to translate the word commonly rendered as "offering." But when placed in juxtaposition they must be held distinctive; and hence we may conclude that our Lord made Himself "an offering" in the perfect obedience of His great humility, "coming to do God's will" (according to the prophetic anticipation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7-8</a>), and gave Himself a "sacrifice," when He completed that offering by shedding His blood on the cross. Both are said to be offered "for us," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on our behalf. We have, therefore, here a complete summary--all the more striking and characteristic because incidental--of the doctrine of the Atonement.<p><span class= "bld">For a sweet-smelling savour.</span>--The sense of this phrase is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Philippians 4:18</a> by the addition of the words "a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God." It is the translation of an expression, frequent in the Old Testament (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm" title="And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-18.htm" title="And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar: it is a burnt offering to the LORD: it is a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Exodus 29:18</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>signifying "a smell of acquiescence" or "satisfaction." It describes the atoning sacrifice as already accepted by God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And walk in love.</span> Taking up anew the exhortation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>. Let your ordinary life be spent in an atmosphere of love. Drink it in from heaven, as plants drink in the sunshine; radiate it forth from eyes and face; let hands and feet be active in the service; let looks, words, and acts all be steeped in it. <span class="cmt_word">Even as Christ also loved us.</span> The passing from the Father to the Son as our Example is not a new departure; for the Son reveals the Father, the Son's love is the counterpart of the Father's, made visible to us in the way most fitted to impress us. Though Christ's love, like his Father's, is eternal, the aorist is used, to denote that specific act of love which is immediately in view. <span class="cmt_word">And gave himself for us.</span> The Pauline phrase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>), simple, but very comprehensive: "himself" - all that he was as God, all that he became as Man, a complete self-surrender, a whole burnt offering. "For us," not merely on our behalf, but in our room (after verbs of giving, dying, etc.); this, indeed, being implied in the idea immediately following of a <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, which, alike to the Jewish and pagan mind, conveyed the idea of a life given in room of another. <span class="cmt_word">An offering and a sacrifice to God.</span> Offering and sacrifice are nearly synonymous, but the first probably includes the whole earthly career of Christ incarnate - his holy life, blessed example, gracious teaching, loving companionship, as well as his atoning death, which last is more precisely the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, sacrifice. The offering and sacrifice were presented to God, to satisfy his justice, fulfill the demands of his law, and glorify his holy and righteous government. <span class="cmt_word">For a sweet-smelling savor.</span> Allusion to Noah's sacrifice of every clean beast and of every fowl - " the Lord smelled a sweet savor;" that is, the whole transaction, not the offering merely, but the spirit in which it was offered likewise, was grateful to God. The whole work of Christ, and the beautiful spirit in which he offered himself, were grateful to the Father, and procure saving blessings for all who by faith make the offering their own. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1,2 Because God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you, therefore be ye followers of God, imitators of God. Resemble him especially in his love and pardoning goodness, as becomes those beloved by their heavenly Father. In Christ's sacrifice his love triumphs, and we are to consider it fully.</body></html>
