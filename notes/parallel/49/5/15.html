The idea, therefore, is not of looking round watchfully against dangers, but of "seeing," that is, being careful, "how we walk strictly;" of finding out the clear line of right, and then keeping to it strictly, so as not "to run uncertainly." In the corresponding passage in the Colossian Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-5.htm" title=" Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.">Colossians 4:5</a>) a similar admonition has especial reference "to those without," and bids us have a resolute unity of aim, a distinct religious profession, amidst all the bewildering temptations of the world. Here it is more general; it bids men not to trust wholly to general rightness of heart, in which "the spirit is willing," but to be watchful over themselves, and to be a law to themselves, "because the flesh is weak."<p><span class= "bld">Not as</span> <span class= "bld">fools, but as wise.</span>--This still further explains the "strictness," for "wisdom" is the practical knowledge of the true end and purpose of life. (See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a>.) He who has it not, whatever his intellectual and spiritual gifts, is "unwise."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take heed then how ye walk strictly.</span> The construction is somewhat peculiar, combining two ideas - see that you walk strictly, but consider well the kind of strictness. Do not walk loosely, without fixed principles of action; but make sure that your rules are of the true kind. Many are strict who are not wisely strict; they have rules, but not good rules. <span class="cmt_word">Not as unwise, but as wise.</span> This rendering brings out the force of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x1f76;</span>: "fools" (A.V.) is rather strong, for it is not utter folly that is reproved, but easy-mindedness, want of earnest consideration in a matter so infinitely vital, so as to know what is truly best. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-21 Another remedy against sin, is care, or caution, it being impossible else to maintain purity of heart and life. Time is a talent given us by God, and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to his design. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must double our diligence for the future. Of that time which thousands on a dying bed would gladly redeem at the price of the whole world, how little do men think, and to what trifles they daily sacrifice it! People are very apt to complain of bad times; it were well if that stirred them more to redeem time. Be not unwise. Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls, show the greatest folly. Drunkenness is a sin that never goes alone, but carries men into other evils; it is a sin very provoking to God. The drunkard holds out to his family and to the world the sad spectacle of a sinner hardened beyond what is common, and hastening to perdition. When afflicted or weary, let us not seek to raise our spirits by strong drink, which is hateful and hurtful, and only ends in making sorrows more felt. But by fervent prayer let us seek to be filled with the Spirit, and to avoid whatever may grieve our gracious Comforter. All God's people have reason to sing for joy. Though we are not always singing, we should be always giving thanks; we should never want disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it, through the whole course of our lives. Always, even in trials and afflictions, and for all things; being satisfied of their loving intent, and good tendency. God keeps believers from sinning against him, and engages them to submit one to another in all he has commanded, to promote his glory, and to fulfil their duties to each other.</body></html>
