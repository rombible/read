Here, however, all is of Christ. He, as Paranymph, comes down to seek and to save His Bride; He, as Bridegroom, receives her in His heavenly home.<p><span class= "bld">A glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle . . .</span>--Properly, (<span class= "ital">that He might present</span>)<span class= "ital"> the Church as glorious, not having a spot </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a stain on its purity), <span class= "ital">or a wrinkle </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a defect in its beauty and freshness of life); <span class= "ital">but that it may be holy</span> (not merely consecrated to holiness) <span class= "ital">and without blemish</span> (as He is without blemish). On these last words see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>. They are most commonly sacrificial, corresponding (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>) to the sacrificial use of the word "present." Here, however, they are seen clearly to have reference to the nuptial metaphor by what goes before.<p>In all this we have a picture which properly belongs to the Church in glory, and which is fully drawn out under the same metaphor as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9-10</a>; for only in it can the description be fully realised. In capacity and promise it belongs to the whole Church militant; in reality, but in imperfection, to the Church invisible on earth; in absolute perfection to the Church triumphant in heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he might present to himself the Church glorious.</span> The ultimate end, to which ver. 26 is introductory. Christ both gives and takes the bride; he presents her to himself - the day of his espousals being in the state of glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), and all the training of this life being designed to fit her for that condition. She becomes glorious at last through assimilation to himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</span> The idea is that of a body perfectly free from blemish, typical of a soul perfectly delivered from sin - of a character perfected in all grace and goodness. <span class="cmt_word">But that it should be holy and without blemish.</span> The same truth expressed in positive form, which in the preceding clause is expressed in the negative. Nothing could more clearly denote perfection of character - the full development of the character with whatever of variety may arise from differences in natural gifts and constitution, or convey a more glorious idea of the destiny of redeemed humanity. To be, as it were, the bride of Christ is a high destiny in point of <span class="accented">condition</span>; but it would be miserable if character did not tally with condition; this agreement, however, is secured, for the Church is to be holy and without blemish. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.</body></html>
