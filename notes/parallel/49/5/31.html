His bones" as parenthetical, and refer back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28-29</a>. In exactly the same way our Lord quotes the same verse of Genesis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>) to show the indissoluble character of the marriage tie. Here the similarity of connection with that of the original passage is even stronger. Because a man's wife is as his own body, "for this cause shall a man," &c. To connect these words with those going before is indeed possible, but somewhat too mystical even for this passage.<p><span class= "bld">Shall a man leave his father . . .</span>--The relation of parentage is one of common flesh and blood, and stands at the head of those natural relations which we do not make, but into which we are born. The relation of marriage is the most sacred of all the ties into which we are not born, and which we do make for ourselves, in accordance with a true or supposed harmony of nature. It becomes, says Holy Scripture, a relation, not of common flesh and blood, but of "one flesh." Itself originally voluntary, it supersedes all natural ties. Our Lord therefore adds, "They are no more twain, but one flesh. What God hath joined together let not man put asunder" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-6.htm" title="Why they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.">Matthew 19:6</a>). Hence it strikingly represents that unity with Christ--voluntarily initiated by Him, voluntarily accepted by us--which yet so supersedes all natural ties that it is said to oblige a man to "hate his father and mother . . . and his own life also" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm" title="If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall come to be one flesh.</span> Quoted in substance from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. It seems to be introduced simply to show the closeness of the relation between man and wife; it is such as in a sense to supersede that between parent and child. The apostle (as appears from the next verse) has in view, at the same time, the parallel truth - the closeness of the relation between Christ and the Church; it too in a sense supersedes the relations of nature (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.</body></html>
