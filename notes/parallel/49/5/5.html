It runs thus: <span class= "ital">For this ye know, knowing</span> . . . But, as it uses two different words, in the former clause properly "ye know" and the latter "learning to know," the sense seems to be: "For this ye know, learning it afresh so as to know it better." Whatever else is doubtful, this is certain; yet it admits of an ever growing certainty.<p><span class= "bld">Covetous man, who is an idolater.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>, "Covetousness, which is idolatry." Whatever becomes the chief object of our desire, so as to claim our chief fear and love, is, of course, an idol; for "ye cannot serve God and mammon." Perhaps in this metaphorical idolatry, as in the literal, there are two distinct stages, passing, however, by invisible gradations into each other--first, the resting on some visible blessing of God, as the one thing in which and for which we serve Him, and so by degrees losing Him in His own gifts; next, the absolute forgetfulness of Him, and the setting up, as is inevitable, of some other object of worship to fill the vacant throne.<p><span class= "bld">Hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and </span>[of] <span class= "bld">God.</span>--The phrase "the kingdom of Christ and God," though probably it does not in strict technicality declare the identity of "Christ" and "God," yet implies that the "kingdom of the Christ" is, as a matter of course, "the kingdom of God," for "the Christ" is by prophetic definition "Emmanuel," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"God with us." The unworthy Christian has indeed "an inheritance" in it, to his own awful responsibility; but in the true spiritual sense he is one "who hath not," "from whom shall be taken that which he hath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this ye know well</span>; an appeal to their own consciences, made confidently, as beyond all doubt. <span class="cmt_word">That no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom.</span> Covetousness, the twin-brother sin of uncleanness, is denounced as idolatry. It is worshipping the creature more than the Creator, depending on vast stores of earthly substance in place of the favor and blessing of God. It must receive the doom of the idolater; instead of inheriting the kingdom, he must die the death. The doom in this verse is not future, but present - not <span class="accented">shall have</span>, but <span class="accented">hath</span>, inheritance, etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11, 18</a>). The lust of greed overreaches itself; it loses all that is truly worth having; it may have this and that - lands, houses, and goods - but it has not one scrap in the kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Of Christ and God.</span> The two are united in the closest way, as equals, implying the divinity of Christ and his oneness with the Father in the administration of the kingdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.</body></html>
