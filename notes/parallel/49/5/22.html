St. Paul passes from warning against special sins to consider the three great relations of life, first considered as "subjections," and so illustrating the general precept of submission in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm" title="Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.">Ephesians 5:21</a>, but ultimately viewed in their reciprocity of mutual obligations and rights. First, accordingly, he dwells on the relation of marriage, declaring it to be hallowed as a type of the unity of Christ with His Church, and hence drawing the inference of the duty of free obedience in the wife, and of self-sacrificing love in the husband. This passage may be held to contain the complete and normal doctrine of the New Testament on this great question, written at a time when Christianity had already begun to exalt and purify the nuptial tie; and it is instructive to compare it with 1 Corinthians 7, written for "the present distress," glancing not obscurely at marriage with unbelievers, and adapted to the condition of a proverbially profligate society, as yet scarcely raised above the low heathen ideas of marriage.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.</span>--The same exhortation is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm" title=" Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm" title="To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1-6</a>; and besides these formal exhortations there is distinct and emphatic declaration of the "subjection of women" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-34.htm" title="Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.">1Corinthians 14:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.">1Timothy 2:11-12</a>. Probably the sense of that fundamental equality in Christ, in which (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>) "there is neither bond nor free, there is <span class= "ital">neither male nor female," </span>while it was rightly accepted as showing that there is no spiritual inferiority in woman--such as Oriental theory asserted, and even Greek and corrupt Roman practice implied--was perverted to the denial of the greater natural weakness of woman, from which subordination comes, and to the foolish and reckless disregard of all social conventions. St. Paul, as usual, brings out the simple truth of principle, sanctioning whatever is fundamental and natural in woman's subordination, and leaving the artificial enactments of law or custom to grow by degrees into accordance with it. The principle of subordination is permanent; the special regulations of it in the world or in the Church must vary as circumstances change.<p><span class= "bld">As unto the Lord.</span>--These words are explained by the next verse. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm" title=" Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.">Colossians 3:18</a> we have the less emphatic phrase, "as it is fitting in the Lord.<span class= "ital">"</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span>-<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>. - EXHORTATION TO RELATIVE DUTIES. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</span> Though Christiani<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.</body></html>
