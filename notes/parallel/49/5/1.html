There the forgiveness of "God in Christ" is set forth in one pregnant phrase. Here the two parts of this idea are divided; and there is put before us, first, the free universal love of God as our Father, and next, the self-sacrificing love of Christ, as the Son of God and man.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Followers of God.</span>--The phrase is unique and very striking; literally, <span class= "ital">imitators of God</span>: and the word "therefore" implies that this imitation of God must be chiefly in His essential attribute of love. It is instructive to observe that our Lord's startling command, "Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm" title="Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.">Matthew 5:48</a>), is explained both by the context and the parallel passage in St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-36.htm" title="Be you therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.">Luke 6:36</a>) to mean, "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father in heaven is merciful." See in Hooker's <span class= "ital">Ecc. Pol., </span>i. 5, a striking passage on the imitation of God as the law of all moral progress in man. In this idea, indeed, lies the essential and distinctive principle of a religious morality as such.<p><span class= "bld">As dear children.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">as children beloved</span> of Him. The knowledge of the love of God to us is the first source, as of our love to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-19.htm" title="We love him, because he first loved us.">1John 4:19</a>), so also of our love to men as brethren under His fatherhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm" title="Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.">1John 4:11</a>). As being His "children," and therefore partakers of the divine nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm" title="Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.">2Peter 1:4</a>), we can imitate Him; as His "beloved children" we imitate Him most naturally in love, and especially in that form of love which we call "mercy," and which, as being ourselves sinners, we especially crave and receive from Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye therefore imitators of God, as children beloved.</span> These words are closely connected with the preceding. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a> he had urged the example of God in one very momentous matter; he now urges it in a more general sense and on another ground. We ought to forgive men because God has forgiven us - all admit that; but moreover, we ought to imitate our Father in his forgiveness and in his loving spirit, be-because beloved children should always imitate, and will always strive to imitate, what is good in a beloved father. Forgiving love is one of the great glories of our Father; it has been made peculiarly attractive in our eyes, because it has been exercised by him towards us; every consideration, therefore, ought to induce us to show the same spirit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1,2 Because God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you, therefore be ye followers of God, imitators of God. Resemble him especially in his love and pardoning goodness, as becomes those beloved by their heavenly Father. In Christ's sacrifice his love triumphs, and we are to consider it fully.</body></html>
