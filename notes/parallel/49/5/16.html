The meaning of this phrase (used also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-5.htm" title=" Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.">Colossians 4:5</a>) is clearly illustrated by its use (although in a bad sense) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-8.htm" title="The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing is gone from me.">Daniel 2:8</a>, "I know that you would gain the time"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>catch the opportunity to escape from difficulty. To "redeem" is "to buy up for oneself"--not having essentially the idea of ransom or redemption, which attaches to the use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>, only from the nature of the context. As applied to opportunity, it carries with it the idea, first of making sacrifice for it, then quickness in seizing it, and sagacity in using it to the utmost, whether by silence or by speech, by facing or avoiding danger, by yielding to a crisis (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm" title="Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;">Romans 12:11</a>) or conquering it. The reason given that "the days are evil" must be taken in the widest sense, of all that induces temptation to swerve out of the "strictness" of the right way. The general lesson is that which is drawn by our Lord in the parable of the Unjust Steward--to apply the wisdom of the buyers and sellers of the world to the work of "the children of light."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil</span>; or, <span class="accented">buying up for yourselves the opportunity</span>, the idea being that of a merchant who, knowing the value of an article and the good use to which he can put it, buys it up. The opportunity is the opportunity of spreading the light and acting according to it; and the reason assigned, "because the days are evil," indicates that, owing to the prevalence of evil, there is much need for the light over which the Christian has control. It may be hinted likewise that the prevalence of evil is apt to cool the love and diminish the zeal of the Christian; hence the need for special eagerness of spirit in the matter - he must greedily watch for his opportunity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:15-21 Another remedy against sin, is care, or caution, it being impossible else to maintain purity of heart and life. Time is a talent given us by God, and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to his design. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must double our diligence for the future. Of that time which thousands on a dying bed would gladly redeem at the price of the whole world, how little do men think, and to what trifles they daily sacrifice it! People are very apt to complain of bad times; it were well if that stirred them more to redeem time. Be not unwise. Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls, show the greatest folly. Drunkenness is a sin that never goes alone, but carries men into other evils; it is a sin very provoking to God. The drunkard holds out to his family and to the world the sad spectacle of a sinner hardened beyond what is common, and hastening to perdition. When afflicted or weary, let us not seek to raise our spirits by strong drink, which is hateful and hurtful, and only ends in making sorrows more felt. But by fervent prayer let us seek to be filled with the Spirit, and to avoid whatever may grieve our gracious Comforter. All God's people have reason to sing for joy. Though we are not always singing, we should be always giving thanks; we should never want disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it, through the whole course of our lives. Always, even in trials and afflictions, and for all things; being satisfied of their loving intent, and good tendency. God keeps believers from sinning against him, and engages them to submit one to another in all he has commanded, to promote his glory, and to fulfil their duties to each other.</body></html>
