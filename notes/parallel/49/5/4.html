But the connection with the words following, and the distinction from those going before, appear to show that St. Paul here uses it for "filthy talking." He is passing from impurity of the inward soul to impurity in outward expression. Of such foul speaking he appears to distinguish two forms. There is, first of all, "foolish talking," or the talk of "the fool," in the worst sense in which that word is used in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-17.htm" title="You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?">Matthew 23:17</a>), as implying something worse than mere emptiness or blindness--describing the condition of the soul which has "lost its savour" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-13.htm" title="You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.">Matthew 5:13</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>has ceased to distinguish what is right or wrong, wise or foolish, noble or base. There is then "jesting," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>properly, the more polished "versatility," which will find occasion for wit or levity in anything, however sacred, fearing nothing so much as to be dull, and mistaking all seriousness and reserve for dulness. It is notable that in classical Greek the word is sometimes used in a good sense, as a mean between "churlishness" and "obsequiousness," but yet hovers on the border of that condemnation which Christian gravity here pronounces unhesitatingly. The former kind of foul talking is coarse and brutal; the latter refined and deadly. Of both kinds Greek and Roman literature furnish specimens only too many and too striking.<p><span class= "bld">Which are not convenient.</span>--That is, "which are out of character" in a Christian--a milder repetition (perhaps suggested by the ambiguous meaning of "jesting" noted above) of the indignant declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>, that it "becomes not saints that these foul things should be even named among them." They pollute the Christian mind and tongue even in condemning them.<p><span class= "bld">But rather giving of</span> <span class= "bld">thanks.</span>--The opposition is striking. "The foolish talking and jesting" aim at mirth and play of mind; St. Paul will not austerely condemn, such light-heartedness, but he finds a wholesome and spiritual vent for it in the habitual expression of thankfulness to God, which proceeds from a natural and childlike cheerfulness. Exactly in the same spirit below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18-20</a>) he contrasts the excitement of drunkenness with the being "filled with the Spirit . . . giving thanks always for all things."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And filthiness</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, implying that such things are disgraceful, ugly, revolting, the opposite of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, fair, comely, attractive. <span class="cmt_word">And foolish talking or jesting, which are not becoming.</span> This would be well understood in sensual, frivolous Ephesus; a light, bantering, jesting kind of talk, seasoned with <span class="accented">double entendres</span> and obscene allusions, very pernicious in its moral effect. There is no reason to suppose that the apostle meant to condemn all play of humor, which is a Divine gift, and which in moderation has its own useful place as a means of refreshing and invigorating the spirit; it was the jesting associated with ribaldry that drew his reproof. <span class="cmt_word">But rather giving of thanks.</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is somewhat similar in sound to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, jesting: the reason for putting the one in opposition to the other is not very apparent; the meaning seems to be that, in place of giving vent to lively feelings in frivolous talk and jesting, it is better for Christians to do so by pouring out their hearts in thanksgivings to God for all his goodness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.</body></html>
