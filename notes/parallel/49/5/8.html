(1) Christ is the "true Light," the "Sun of Righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-5.htm" title="As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.">John 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm" title="I am come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.">John 12:46</a>). His servants are sometimes mere secondary lights (or "candles") (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-33.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, puts it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.">Luke 11:33-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-36.htm" title="If your whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle does give you light.">Luke 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>), kindled from His rays; sometimes, like the moon or planets, they are said, as reflecting His light, or as having His light in them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come on you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.">John 12:35</a>), to be actually "the light of the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm" title="You are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.">Matthew 5:14</a>), which, however, shines as a mere reflected light, so that "men glorify" not it, but "the Father which is in heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>). They thus become light, but only "in the Lord:" that is, as being made one with Him. (2) So, on the other hand, they who walk in darkness are said to be themselves darkness--new sources, so to speak, of the darkness which hates and quenches light, both to themselves and to others. "The light" which is in them "becomes darkness;" "and how great is that darkness!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-23.htm" title="But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that darkness!">Matthew 6:23</a>.) As there is a natural delight in giving light, so the reprobate state is distinguished by a horrible pleasure in spreading the cloud of delusion, sin, or unbelief, by which to hide God from man.<p><span class= "bld">Walk as children of light.</span>--So our Lord teaches, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become children of light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-36.htm" title="While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm" title="You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.">1Thessalonians 5:5</a>). "Children of light" are they who not only love the light, but also manifest the likeness of the one true Light, "the Father of Lights" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>), being His children in Jesus Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord.</span> Another expressive "but." To make the contrast more emphatic, it is not said, "ye were in darkness, but are now in light;" but, "ye were darkness itself, and are now light itself," and this last is explained by the usual formula, "in the Lord." There was a celebrated Ephesian philosopher, Alexander, who was called "The Light;" but not from that source had the light come. The idea of <span class="accented">light-giving</span> is also involved in their being light. "Arise, shine, for thy light is come." <span class="cmt_word">Walk as children of light.</span> Another expressive image, denoting close connection with light, as if they were actually born of it; hence their lives should be full of it. The figure connecting darkness with sin and light with purity, common to all languages, underlies the exhortation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.</body></html>
