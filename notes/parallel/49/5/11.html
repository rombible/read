So the word is used, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.">Philippians 4:14</a>, of "communicating with my affliction;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm" title="And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.">Revelation 18:4</a>, of "being partakers with the sins" of Babylon. It is through such weak or cowardly indulgence, more than the actual love of evil, that sin is suffered to prevail. Hence St. Paul adds, "rather reprove them." Our Lord Himself has declared in all such cases, "He that is not with Me is against Me."<p><span class= "bld">The unfruitful works of darkness.</span>--St. Paul has a similar antithesis in the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-19.htm" title="I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.">Romans 6:19-22</a>). They who are in sin "yield their members servants to iniquity unto iniquity." Iniquity has no result but iniquity; and hence he goes on to ask, "What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed?" This weary fruitlessness is at once the sign and the penalty of sin, so that men have fancied it to be one chief element of the suffering of the lost. But they who are in Christ "yield their members servants to righteousness unto holiness." "They have," he says, "their fruit unto holiness" now, and "in the end the everlasting life," which is everlasting holiness. Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20-22</a>, we have "the works of the flesh," but "the fruit of the Spirit." Rarely, indeed, does Scripture speak of "evil fruit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-17.htm" title="Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.">Matthew 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-33.htm" title="Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.">Matthew 12:33</a>). Generally, "to be unfruitful" is an all-sufficient condemnation. "Every branch that beareth not fruit he taketh away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-2.htm" title="Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every branch that bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit.">John 15:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Rather reprove them.</span>--In the word "reprove," whether in its application to the witness of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>), or to the witness of men (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1Corinthians 14:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-20.htm" title="Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.">1Timothy 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/1-9.htm" title="Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the disputers.">Titus 1:9-13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>), there is described a double function--to "convince," if it may be, the sinner in himself; to "convict" him, if the other function fails, before men and angels. Both these functions St. Paul urges here. It is not enough to "have no fellowship with them." To this tacit reproof open reproof in word and deed is to be added; only in such reproof it should be remembered that it would be disgraceful "even to speak" in detail of the actual "things done in secret."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.</span> The point of this exhortation is in the adjective "unfruitful." The works of darkness are unfruitful; they produce no goodness, give rise to no satisfaction, to no moral results that are "a joy forever;" or, if fruit they have, it is shame, remorse, despair. Contrast this with the renovating, satisfying, joy-producing, fruits of righteousness. <span class="cmt_word">But rather even reprove them.</span> Do not be content with a passive attitude towards them, but take the aggressive and expose their wickedness, whether in public or in the domestic circle. A testimony has to be lifted up against ways that are so shameful and that bring down the wrath of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.</body></html>
