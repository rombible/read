He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28</a>), <span class= "ital">his own body.</span> There are two parts of the natural care for our own bodies; first, "to nourish" (properly, <span class= "ital">to rear them up from childhood, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm" title="And, you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.">Ephesians 6:4</a>), and then "to cherish" (literally, <span class= "ital">to keep them warm</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>to provide all they need for health, and comfort, and life. In all that corresponds to both, the husband is to show love to the wife, not only as a self, but as a weaker self, for whom he is bound to think and to act. It may be noted in passing that the very comparison accords with the Christian idea of the body as a part of the true self, redeemed to be a temple of God; and is utterly incongruous with the Gnostic conceptions (already beginning at Colossae, probably not unknown in other Asiatic churches) of all matter as the source of evil, and of the body as that for which the spirit should not deign to care.<p>(29, 30) <span class= "bld">Even as the Lord the church: for we . . .</span>--Again St. Paul escapes from the type to rest on the Antitype (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a>). The idea of the natural rearing and cherishing the body suggests the thought of the tender care of Christ, in which He "rears up" His Church from weak infancy to full maturity in heaven, and all the while "cherishes it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1Thessalonians 2:7</a>, spoken of His servants) as a nurse cherisheth her children," "carrying it in His bosom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>), comforting and cheering its childlike weakness. Hence he goes back again to speak with great and special emphasis of our unity with Him.<p><span class= "bld">Of his flesh, and of his bones.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">made out of His flesh and bones</span>--parts, that is, of His glorified body, having "flesh and bones" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm" title="Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.">Luke 24:39</a>). The expression is unique, suggested, of course, by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>, "This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh," but designed to bring out in a startling emphasis the true meaning of the familiar phrase, "the members of His body." We are grafted into Him. What we grow to be is, so to speak, the product of His divine substance, proceeding from the indwelling life which gradually forms the organised limbs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the Church.</span> To hate one's wife is as irrational as to hate one's own flesh, and as, on the other hand, men constantly nourish and cherish their flesh, protecting it from hurt, seeking to heal it when hurt, and generally to promote its welfare and comfort, so ought husbands to act towards their wives. In this aspect of the case, too, the sharp eye of the apostle finds an analogy between the relation of the wife to the husband and that of the Church to Christ, expanded in the next verso. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.</body></html>
