There the type and earnest of the working of God's mighty power are placed in the resurrection, the ascension, the glorification of Christ Himself in His human nature. Here what is there implied is worked out--(1) All Christians are declared to be quickened (or, <span class= "ital">risen again</span>) to spiritual life with Christ, according to His promise, "Because I live, ye shall live also" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm" title="Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.">John 14:19</a>). (See the exact parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>.) But there is a promise even beyond this: "I am the life: whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2</a>). Hence, even more emphatically, and in full accordance with this latter promise, we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>, "Christ who is our life;" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10-11</a>, "The life of Jesus is made manifest in us." What this "life eternal" is He Himself declares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>)--"to know the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent." (2) Next, this partaking of the life of Christ is brought out in two striking forms--as a partaking, not only of His resurrection (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.">1Corinthians 15:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Philippians 3:11</a>), but also (in a phase of thought peculiar to these Epistles) of His ascension "to the heavenly places." This is "in Christ Jesus," in virtue of a personal and individual union with Christ. It implies blessings, both present and future, or rather one blessing, of which we have the earnest now and the fulness hereafter--for the resurrection and ascension of Christ are even now the perfection and glorification of humanity in Him. (3) So far as we are really and vitally His members, such perfection and glorification are ours now, by His intercession (that is, His continued mediation for us in heaven) and by His indwelling in us by the Spirit on earth. The proof of partaking His resurrection is "newness of life," "death unto sin, and new birth unto righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5-11</a>), which is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a> expressly connected with the entrance upon unity with Christ in baptism. The proof of having "our life hid in Christ at the right hand of God," is "the setting our affection on things above" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>), by which "in heart and mind we thither ascend, and with Him continually dwell." (4) These proofs are seen only in measure here. Through the change which we call death, we pass at once to a still higher stage of life, by fuller union with Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:">2Corinthians 5:6-8</a>), and at the great day we shall have both in perfection--perfect newness of life in "likeness to Him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1John 3:2</a>), and perfect glorification in Him in that communion with God which is heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>). The one thing which St. Paul does not attribute to us is that which is His alone--the place "at the right hand of the Father."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even when we were dead in our sins.</span> Repeated from ver. 1, in order to set in its true light the declaration that follows of what God did for us to make more emphatic the free and sovereign mercy of God. Though sin is the abominable thing which he hates, loathsome to him in the last degree, he did not turn from us when we were immersed in it; nor did he wait till we began to move towards him: he began to influence us even when we were dead. Made us alive together with Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Made us alive with the life which is in Christ and which flows from Christ.</span> A parallel is run between the way in which God's power operated on the <span class="accented">body</span> of Christ, and the way in which it operates on the <span class="accented">souls</span> of believers in him in respect of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the quickening; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the raising up from the grave; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the seating of them in heavenly places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Father, having "given to the Son to have life in himself," and "the Son quickening whom he will" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-21.htm">John 6:21, 26</a>), by God's decree we were first quickened by him, made partakers of Christ's life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, etc.). All the life we had lost was restored - the life forfeited by transgression, the life of a calm and well-ordered heart, the sublime life of fellowship with God. <span class="cmt_word">By grace have ye been saved.</span> This is a parenthetical clause, more fully dwelt on in ver. 8, thrown in here abruptly by the apostle in the fullness of his heart, to throw light on this great wonder - that Christ should impart his own life to souls dead in sin. Grace in opposition to human merit is at the root of the whole arrangement; free, undeserved mercy. It is not anything that God is bound to by the necessity of his nature. It is the result of his will, not of his nature. Had it not been for his good pleasure, salvation had never been. "Saved" is the past participle (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), denoting, not the act of being saved, but the fact of having been saved. Salvation in a real sense is a present possession. When we are one with Christ we are justified freely by God's grace, our trespasses are all forgiven. The spirit of new moral life has been given to us; we are made alive to God. But while salvation is a present attainment in a real sense, its full realization is future, for that includes perfect holiness, and also the glorification of the body. In this sense salvation is to come (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Sin is the death of the soul. A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.</body></html>
