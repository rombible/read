The declaration of the nullity of circumcision as a religious distinction is often repeated, yet takes various forms. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>, it is contrasted with the practical reality of obedience to God's commandments; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>, with the inner reality of "faith working by love "; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>, with the divine gift of the "new creation"; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>, with the spiritual unity of all in Christ. (Comp. also the whole argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm" title="For circumcision truly profits, if you keep the law: but if you be a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.">Romans 2:25</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm" title="And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.">Romans 4:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In the flesh made by hands.</span>--St. Paul, however, not content with this, suggests by the addition of these last words a contrast between the false or carnal, and the true or spiritual circumcision, attributing the former to the unbelieving Jews, the latter to all Christians. This contrast is expressly announced in the other Epistles of this period. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2-3</a>, we read, "Beware of the concision; for we are the circumcision." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>, still more distinctly, in significant connection with the appointed means of entrance into the Christian covenant, and significant contrast with the effete Jewish ordinance, "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision not made with hands . . . in the circumcision of Christ; buried with Him in baptism, in which also ye are risen with Him." In that true circumcision lies the distinction between the Church, which is the spiritual Israel, and the heathen world without.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-22.</span> - CONTRAST BETWEEN PAST AND THE PRESENT. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh.</span> The practical tenor of the apostle's teaching is indicated by his "wherefores." He is always gathering up his views into some lesson. They are to "remember" the change between the past and the present - what they were by nature, and what they had become by grace. This is most useful to all, even though the contrast between the two be not so vivid as in the case of Paul and the Ephesians. The contrast is indicated in various particulars, both of outward condition and of inward privilege and character. First, the old condition. They were "Gentiles in respect of the flesh" - not bearing <span class="accented">on their bodies</span> the mark of the Israel of God, therefore not marked out for blessing, not apparently near it. <span class="cmt_word">Who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision in the flesh made by hands.</span> Nicknamed, as it were, Uncircumcision by those who in a fleshly or mechanical, but not always in the true spiritual sense (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), were called Circumcision; they had a name which denoted the very opposite of that given to God's people - another illustration of their apparent distance from blessing; they revolved round the sun, as it were, not in the nearer orbits of planets warmed, brightened, and beautified by the solar beams, but in the outermost ring of all - like the cold, dark orbit of Uranus or Neptune, which the sunbeams hardly reach to lighten or to warm. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-13 Christ and his covenant are the foundation of all the Christian's hopes. A sad and terrible description is here; but who is able to remove himself out of it? Would that this were not a true description of many baptized in the name of Christ. Who can, without trembling, reflect upon the misery of a person, separated for ever from the people of God, cut off from the body of Christ, fallen from the covenant of promise, having no hope, no Saviour, and without any God but a God of vengeance, to all eternity? To have no part in Christ! What true Christian can hear this without horror? Salvation is far from the wicked; but God is a help at hand to his people; and this is by the sufferings and death of Christ.</body></html>
