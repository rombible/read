The idea of richness in grace, glory, mercy, is especially frequent in this Epistle. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For his great</span> <span class= "bld">love.</span>--Again, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>, stress is laid on the love of God, before all else, as the one moving cause of salvation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm" title="But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.">Romans 5:8</a>, "God commendeth His love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God, being rich in mercy.</span> The preceding verses convey the idea of a rushing towards inevitable ruin - towards some frightful cataract, when all help from man is hopeless. Man's extremity becomes God's opportunity. The "but" is very emphatic, and wonderfully reverses the picture. The sovereignty of God is very apparent, on its gracious side. It interposes to rescue those who would otherwise plunge into irretrievable ruin. We have here the filling up of that Divine saying, "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thine help." The genesis of salvation is declared to be in two of God's attributes, of which the first is mercy, or compassion. God has a tender, yearning feeling towards men brought to misery by their own sins. And this feeling is not shallow or spare - he is rich in mercy. It is an exuberant, full-flowing feeling in God ("Thy mercy ... is in the heavens," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>), and may therefore be appealed to trustfully. <span class="cmt_word">For his great love wherewith he loved us.</span> The other attribute from which the plan of salvation sprang is God's love. Love is more than compassion. Compassion may be confined to the breast, but love goes forth in active beneficence. It makes common cause with its object. It cannot rest till its object is lint right. Two expressions are used intensifying this Divine love: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> his great love; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> love with which he loved us; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the verb of love governing the noun of love makes the idea rich and strong. This view of the exuberance of the Divine attributes from which salvation has its rise is in harmony with the whole character of the Epistle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Sin is the death of the soul. A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.</body></html>
