The words "hath He quickened" (or, properly, <span class= "ital">did He quicken</span>) are supplied here from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>--rightly, as expressing the true sense and tending to greater clearness, but perhaps not necessarily.<p><span class= "bld">Trespasses and sins.</span>--These two words, more often used separately, are here brought together, to form a climax. The word rendered "trespass" signifies a "swerving aside and falling"; the word rendered "sins" is generally used by St. Paul in the singular to denote "sin" in the abstract, and signifies an entire "missing of the mark" of life. Hence, even in the plural, it denotes universal and positive principles of evil doing, while "trespass" rather points to failure in visible and special acts of those not necessarily out of the right way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - SPIRITUAL HISTORY OF THE EPHESIANS. This passage corresponds to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. It is a history of creation, and we note the same great stages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Chaos (vers. 1-3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The dawn - the Spirit of God moving on the face of the waters (ver. 4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The work of creation - in successive stages (vers. 4-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">You also, who were dead in your trespasses and your sins.</span> The apostle returns from his digression, in which he had shown the marvelous working of the Divine power on Christ, to show the working of the same power on the Ephesian converts themselves. The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1f00;&#x3c2;</span> is not governed by any verb going before; it manifestly depends on the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 5, but it is separated from it by a new digression (vers. 2, 3), on which the apostle immediately starts. While the same quickening power of God was exerted on Christ and on the Ephesians, it was exerted to very different effects: in the case of Christ, raising him literally from the dead and exalting him to heavenly glory; in the case of the Ephesians, raising them from spiritual death and exalting them to high spiritual privileges. We may observe the change from the second to the first person, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, in this chapter as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1.htm">Ephesians 1</a>. Second person (vers. 1, 8, 11); first (vers. 3, 10, 14); and the two streams brought together (ver. 18). The chapter closes beautifully with an emblem of the Church as the one temple of which <span class="accented">all</span> believers are parts. The <span class="accented">death</span> ascribed to the Ephesians in their natural state is evidently <span class="accented">spiritual</span> death, and "trespasses and sins," being in the dative (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), seems to indicate the cause of death - "dead through your trespasses and your sins" (R.V.); "dead <span class="accented">of</span> your trespasses," etc., is suggested by Alford. It is not easy to assign a different meaning to the two nouns here; some suggest <span class="accented">acts</span> of transgression for the one, and sinful tendencies or principles for the other, but this distinction cannot be carried out in all other passages. The killing effect of sin is indicated. As sins of sensuality kill truthfulness, industry, integrity, and all virtue, so sin generally, affecting as it does our whole nature, kills, or does not suffer to live, the affections and movements of the spiritual life. A state of "death" implies previous life - the <span class="accented">race</span> lived before; it implies also a state of insensibility, of utter powerlessness and helplessness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Sin is the death of the soul. A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.</body></html>
