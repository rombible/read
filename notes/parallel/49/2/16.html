On the reconciliation of man to God, see the great passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18-21</a>. But it should be noted that in the original the word used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20-21</a> (and nowhere else) is a compound signifying not simply to "conciliate," but properly to "reconcile,"--that is to reunite those who were originally united, but afterwards separated by the sin of man. This brings out the profound idea, which so especially characterises these Epistles, of a primeval unity of all created being in Christ, marred and broken by sin, and restored by His manifestation in human flesh. Note that the passage in the Colossians (on which see Notes) has a far wider scope than this passage--"having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things to Himself; by Him (I say), whether they be things on earth or things in heaven." On the other hand, this passage characteristically still lays stress on the idea "in one body"--that is, as throughout, His mystical body, the Church--although probably the phrase is suggested here by the thought of the natural body of the Lord offered on the cross, which is clearly referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>. There is a similar connection of thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1Corinthians 10:16-17</a>, "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we are all one bread, and one body."<p><span class= "bld">By the cross, having slain the enmity thereby.</span>--In this verse (in accordance with the context) "the enmity," which by His death He "slew," is the barrier between God and man, created by sin, but brought out by the Law, as hard and rigid law, "in ordinances" of which St. Paul does not hesitate to say that "sin took occasion by it," and "by it slew" man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-11.htm" title="For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.">Romans 7:11</a>). This is illustrated by the cognate, though different, metaphor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>, where it is said of Christ that He "blotted out the handwriting of ordinances which was against us, which was contrary unto us, and took it out of the way, <span class= "ital">nailing it to His cross."</span> Compare also, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19-20</a>, the connection of spiritual "death to the Law" with our partaking of our Lord's crucifixion: "I, through the Law, am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God. <span class= "ital">I am crucified with Christ, </span>nevertheless I live. . . . by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and <span class= "ital">gave Himself for me."</span> By His death Christ has both redeemed us from sin, and also "redeemed (properly, <span class= "ital">bought</span>) us from the curse of the Law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross.</span> Exegetical of preceding statements, and making emphatic the fact of reconciliation to God on <span class="accented">the same footing and by the same means</span>; both were to be reconciled <span class="accented">in</span>, <span class="accented">one body</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>) and <span class="accented">by the cross</span>. No preference was to be given to the Jew facilitating his union to Christ: the Gentile was to be taken into Christ's body as readily as the Jew. In reference to the sense in which reconciliation was effected by the cross of Jesus, some say it was only as the cross demonstrated to men the love of God and his willingness to bless them; while others maintain very strongly that it was as providing a satisfaction to God's justice for their guilt, and thus enabling him to receive and bless the sinner. Not only the analogy of other passages of Scripture as well as of this Epistle justifies the latter view, but preeminently the words, "by the cross." If Christ had only to <span class="accented">proclaim</span> God's friendship toward sinners, why should he have suffered on the cross? The cross as a mere pulpit is hideous; as an altar it is glorious. The love of God is ill revealed, if it subjected Jesus to unnecessary agony. The love of both Father and Son is indeed commended, if the agony was voluntarily borne by the Son, and permitted by the Father, as being indispensable for the pardon of the sinner. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;</span> denotes the whole process of reconciliation (see Eadie). <span class="cmt_word">Having slain the enmity thereby</span> (or, <span class="accented">thereon</span>). "The enmity" is the same as at the beginning of ver. 15 - the enmity of man to God. The destruction of this enmity is one of the effects of the cross, though not the only effect; it is necessary to root out the enmity of the carnal mind. That this is the meaning here seems plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, "If, <span class="accented">when we were enemies</span>, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son." The apostle there makes no allusion to the enmity of Jew and Gentile to each other, but to this wider fact - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. If any words can denote the result of a propitiatory sacrifice, it is surely "reconciled to God by the death of his Son." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 Jesus Christ made peace by the sacrifice of himself; in every sense Christ was their Peace, the author, centre, and substance of their being at peace with God, and of their union with the Jewish believers in one church. Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit gives a heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve God acceptably.</body></html>
