In the original the order is emphatic: "Through Him we have the access, both of us in one Spirit, to the Father." The greater idea of access to God is still prominent; but the lesser idea of union with each other in that access is still traceable as an undertone. "Access" is properly "the introduction" (used also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>), a technical word of presentation to a royal presence. So says Chrysostom, "We came not of ourselves, but He brought us in." The corresponding verb is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>, "Christ also suffered for sins--the just for the unjust--that He might <span class= "ital">bring us to God."</span> It will be noted that we have here one of the implicit declarations of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, so frequent in this Epistle. The unity of the whole Church, as united "to the Father," "through the Son," and "in the Spirit," is here summed up in one sentence, but with as much perfection and clearness as even when it is unfolded in the great passage below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>). The ultimate source of all doctrine on the subject is necessarily in the words of the Lord Himself. (See John 14-17, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20-21</a>.) For these are the "heavenly things"; and "no man hath ascended into heaven but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man who is in heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12-13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For through him both of us have our access by one Spirit unto the Father.</span> Further illustration of identity of position of Jews and Gentiles, and of the work of Christ in bringing it about. Subject of this verse, access to the Father; predicate, this access effected through Christ by the one Spirit. Our having access to the Father is assumed as a matter of spiritual experience; the converted Ephesians knew that in their prayers and other exercises they did really stand before God, and felt as children to a Father. How came this to pass? "Through him." Sinful men have not this privilege by nature; "Your iniquities have <span class="accented">separated</span> between you and your God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). They need a Mediator; Jesus is that Mediator; and through him, both Jews and Gentiles enjoy the privilege. But right of access is not enough; in approaching God and holding fellowship with him there must be some congeniality of soul, a fellow-feeling between God and the worshipper; this is effected through the same Spirit. Some render "in the same spirit, or disposition of mind." This is true, but not all the truth; for the question arises - How do we get this suitable disposition? And the answer is - It is wrought by the Holy Spirit. As the state of the soul in true intercourse with God is substantially the same in all, so it is brought by the same Holy Spirit. In fact, this verse is one of the characteristic texts of Ephesians, in which Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are brought together. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 Jesus Christ made peace by the sacrifice of himself; in every sense Christ was their Peace, the author, centre, and substance of their being at peace with God, and of their union with the Jewish believers in one church. Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit gives a heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve God acceptably.</body></html>
