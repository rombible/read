But we note that at that very time He repeated the salutation "Peace be unto you," with the expressive addition, "As my Father hath sent Me, even so send I you," and with the charge, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost," for the future mission "to remit or retain sins." In the same connection we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, being yet present with you.">John 14:25-28</a>, the promise of the Comforter, and the words "Peace I leave with you; My peace I give unto you. . . . I go away and come again to you." Hence we cannot limit His "coming" to the appearance after the Resurrection. At all times through the witness of the Holy Spirit, whether with or without the preaching of His servants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-27.htm" title="And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.">John 15:27</a>), He "stands at the door and knocks" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>) with the message of peace. For since the "peacemakers" are "called the children of God," He, the Son of God, must be emphatically the Peacemaker.<p><span class= "bld">To you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</span>--As the enmity was the enmity with God, so the peace is peace with God; but still the Apostle, having the idea of reunion between Jew and Gentile present to his mind, cannot refrain from bringing out clearly the call of both to one peace, and therefore to unity with one another. The passage is a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-19.htm" title="I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the LORD; and I will heal him.">Isaiah 57:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And having come, he preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to these that were nigh.</span> The coming denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> is subsequent to the transactions of the cross. It cannot denote what Christ did personally, but what he did by sending his Spirit to the apostles and other early preachers. It was only after the cross and after the resurrection that peace could be proclaimed on the footing of faith in a Savior who had died and was alive. And only in the sense of having sent his preachers and given them his Spirit could Jesus be said to have preached to the Ephesians. The repetition of the word "peace" in the R.V. is expressive; if the subject had been merely peace between the two classes of men, we should not have had the repetition; the repetition denotes peace between each of the two classes and a third party, viz. God. It is remarkable that the Gentiles, "those that were far off," are mentioned here before the Jews, "those that were nigh." In point of chronology, the Jews came first; but the order is here transposed, probably to emphasize the offer of the gospel to the Gentiles, and to show that spiritually they were as near as the Jews. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 Jesus Christ made peace by the sacrifice of himself; in every sense Christ was their Peace, the author, centre, and substance of their being at peace with God, and of their union with the Jewish believers in one church. Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit gives a heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve God acceptably.</body></html>
