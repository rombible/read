The latter word is used literally in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.">Acts 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-29.htm" title="Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.">Acts 7:29</a> (there rendered "sojourner"), and often in the LXX. version; perhaps metaphorically in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>. Such a sojourner, though in some sense less an absolute alien than the mere "stranger," was one on whom by daily contrast the sense of being an alien, excluded from power and privilege, was more forcibly impressed.<p><span class= "bld">Fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.</span>--In sense this double expression preserves the double idea running through the whole chapter. The phrase "fellowcitizens of the saints" is applied to the Gentiles, as now united with the Israel of God in one "commonwealth." (See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>.) "Members of the household of God" refers rather to the union with God, restored by the blood of Jesus Christ. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>.) As to the metaphor, the word "stranger"--that is, <span class= "ital">alien</span>--seems to be opposed to "fellowcitizen"<span class= "ital">;</span> the word "foreigner"--that is, <span class= "ital">half-alien</span>--to members of the household: for the resident aliens stood opposed to the "houses," the families or clans, of the citizens--the unit in ancient law being always the family, and not the individual. The Gentiles were now brought into a "household," and that household the household of God Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So then ye are no more strangers and foreigners.</span> "Sojourners" is nearer <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> than "foreigners;" it denotes persons dwelling in a place, but without citizen rights and privileges; but as such persons are usually foreigners, it is immaterial which term is used. <span class="cmt_word">But ye are fellow-citizens with the saints.</span> The saints are the chosen ones of all time (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>, "But ye are come unto Mount Zion," etc.). "Their names are engraven on the same civic roll with all whom ' the Lord shall count when be reckoneth up the people." It is as if they who had dwelt in the waste and howling wilderness, scattered defenseless and in melancholy isolation, had been transplanted, not only into Palestine, but had been appointed to domiciles on Mount Zion, and were located in the metropolis, not to admire its architecture, or gaze upon its battlements, or envy the tribes who had come up to worship in the city which is compact together; but to claim its municipal immunities, experience its protection, obey its laws, live and love in its happy society, and hold communion with its glorious Founder and Guardian" (Eadie). <span class="cmt_word">And (members) of the household of God.</span> A nearer relation to God and a higher privilege is denoted here. You are not guests or occasional visitors, but permanent dwellers in the house and members of the family. Compare the Queen of Sheba's words to Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-8.htm">1 Kings 10:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-22 The church is compared to a city, and every converted sinner is free of it. It is also compared to a house, and every converted sinner is one of the family; a servant, and a child in God's house. The church is also compared to a building, founded on the doctrine of Christ; delivered by the prophets of the Old Testament, and the apostles of the New. God dwells in all believers now; they become the temple of God through the working of the blessed Spirit. Let us then ask if our hopes are fixed on Christ, according to the doctrine of his word? Have we devoted ourselves as holy temples to God through him? Are we habitations of God by the Spirit, are we spiritually-minded, and do we bring forth the fruits of the Spirit? Let us take heed not to grieve the holy Comforter. Let us desire his gracious presence, and his influences upon our hearts. Let us seek to discharge the duties allotted to us, to the glory of God.</body></html>
