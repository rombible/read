The words the "enmity in His flesh" may be in apposition to the "wall of partition" in the previous verse; or, as in our version, to "the law of commandments." The general sense, however, is but little affected in either case.<p><span class= "bld">Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances.</span>--In this difficult passage it will be well first to examine the particular expressions. (1) The word rendered "to abolish" is the word often used by St. Paul for "to supersede by something better than itself"--translated "to make void," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>; to "bring to nought," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-28.htm" title="And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are:">1Corinthians 1:28</a>, and (in the passive) "to fail," "to vanish away," "to be done away," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1Corinthians 13:8-10</a>. Now, of the relation of Christ to the Law, St. Paul says, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>, "Do we make void the Law? God forbid! Yea, we establish the Law." The Law, therefore, is abolished as a law "in ordinances"--that is, "in the letter"--and is established in the spirit. (2) "The law of commandments in ordinances." The word here rendered "ordinance" (<span class= "ital">dogma</span>) properly means "a decree." It is used only in this sense in the New Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm" title="Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-23.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.">Hebrews 11:23</a>); and it signifies expressly a law imposed and accepted, not for its intrinsic righteousness, but on authority; or, as Butler expresses it (<span class= "ital">Anal., </span>Part ii., Ephesians 1), not a "moral," but "a positive law." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a> (the parallel passage) the word is connected with a "handwriting" that is a legal "bond"; and the Colossians are reproved for subjecting themselves to "ordinances, which are but a shadow of things to come"; while "the body," the true substance, "is Christ." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20-21</a>.) (3) Hence the whole expression describes explicitly what St. Paul always implies in his proper and distinctive use of the word "law." It signifies the will of God, as expressed in formal commandments, and enforced by penalties on disobedience. The general idea, therefore, of the passage is simply that which is so often brought out in the earlier Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-1.htm" title="Know you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?">Romans 7:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-1.htm" title="There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15-21</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but which (as the Colossian Epistle more plainly shows) now needed to be enforced under a somewhat different form--viz., that Christ, "the end of the law," has superseded it by the free covenant of the Spirit; and that He has done this for us "in His flesh," especially by His death and resurrection. (4) But in what sense is this Law called "the enmity," which (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>) was "slain" on the Cross? Probably in the double sense, which runs through the passage: first, as "an enmity," a cause of separation and hostility, between the Gentiles and those Jews whom they called "the enemies of the human race"; next, as "an enmity" a cause of alienation and condemnation, between man and God--"the commandment which was ordained to life, being found to be unto death" through the rebellion and sin of man. The former sense seems to be the leading sense here, where the idea is of "making both one"; the latter in the next verse, which speaks of "reconciling both to God," all the partitions are broken down, that all alike may have "access to the Father." Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>, "You, who were enemies in your mind, He hath reconciled;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>, "Having confidence to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He hath consecrated to us, <span class= "ital">through the veil, that is to say His flesh."</span><p><span class= "bld">For to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace.</span>--In this clause and the following verse the two senses, hitherto united, are now distinguished from each other. Here we have the former sense simply. In the new man "there is neither Jew nor Gentile," but "Christ is all and in all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>). This phrase, "the new man" (on which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>), is peculiar to these Epistles; corresponding, however, to the "new creature" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>; and the "newness of life" and "spirit" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>. Christ Himself is the "second man, the Lord from Heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-47.htm" title="The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.">1Corinthians 15:47</a>). "As we have borne the image of the first man, of the earth, earthy," and so "in Adam die," we now "bear the image of the heavenly," and not only "shall be made alive," but already "have our life hid with Christ in God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>). He is at once "the seed of the woman" and the "seed of Abraham"; in Him, therefore, Jew and Gentile meet in a common humanity. Just in proportion to spirituality or newness of life is the sense of unity, which makes all brethren. Hence the new creation "makes peace"--here probably peace between Jew and Gentile, rather than peace with God, which belongs to the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - (<span class="cmt_word">To wit, the enmity</span>.) It is a moot point whether <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is to be taken as governed by <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 14, or by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the end of this verse. Both A.V. and R.V. adopt the latter; but the former is more textual and natural. Another question is - What enmity? Some say between Jews and Gentiles; others, between both and God. The latter seems right; where "the enmity" is so emphatically referred to, it must be the great or fundamental enmity, and the whole tenor of the passage is to the effect that in the removal of the enmity of the sinner to God, the abolition of the enmity between Jew and Gentile was provided for. <span class="cmt_word">In his flesh.</span> These words are not to be connected with the enmity, for then they would require <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> before them, but with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 14) or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 15). In his flesh, crucified, broken, for our sins, Christ virtually broke down the enmity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Having abolished the law of commandments in ordinances.</span> Some think that "in ordinances" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, doctrines) denotes the means by which the Law was abolished - by means of doctrines, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the doctrines of Christianity. But New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is not equal to "doctrine." "In ordinances" limits the law of commandments. The law abolished or superseded by Christ was the law of positive requirements embodied in things decreed, evidently the ceremonial law of the Jews; certainly not the moral law (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>). By removing this, Jesus removed that which had become the occasion of bitter feelings between Jew and Gentile; the Jew looking down proudly on the Gentile, and the Gentile despising what he deemed the fantastic rites of the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">That he might create the two in himself into one new man.</span> The idea of a corporate body comes here into view. Christ's object was not merely to restore individuals, but to rear <span class="accented">a Church</span>, composed of many units incorporated into one body. This idea is prominent in the rest of the Epistle. Hence the strong word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, create; not only is every believer a new creation, but the corporate organization into which they are built is also a creation. The two are made "one new man;" the Gentile is not turned into a Jew, nor the Jew into a Gentile, but both into one new man, thus removing all grounds of jealousy. This transformation is "in himself;" in vital union to Christ they are formed into one body. No Church connection of man with man is the true connection, unless it is founded on a mutual connection with Christ. <span class="cmt_word">So making peace</span>; that is, between Jew and Gentile. The peacemaking with God, as we have seen, is referred to in the first words of the verse; this at the end is the subordinate peacemaking, the result of the other. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 Jesus Christ made peace by the sacrifice of himself; in every sense Christ was their Peace, the author, centre, and substance of their being at peace with God, and of their union with the Jewish believers in one church. Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit gives a heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve God acceptably.</body></html>
