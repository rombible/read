Generally the best MSS. omit the article in the original. But the sense seems to demand the rendering of the text, unless, indeed, we adopt the only other possible rendering, "in whom every act of building"--that is, every addition to the building--"is bonded to the rest, and grows," &c. The clause agrees substantially, and almost verbally with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>--"From whom the whole body, fitly joined (<span class= "ital">framed</span>) together and compacted . . . maketh increase of the body unto the edifying (<span class= "ital">building up</span>) of itself." In this latter passage the leading idea is of the<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whom all the building.</span> Not even the figure of a building can keep the apostle from his favorite idea of vital fellowship with Christ as the soul of all Christianity - "in whom." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> is rendered in R.V. "each several building." But surely the want of the article does not make imperative a rendering which is out of keeping with the apostle's object, viz. to illustrate the organic unity of believers, Jewish and Gentile, as one great body (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>, "There is one body"). If there had been many several or separate buildings in the apostle's view, why not a Jewish building and a Gentile building? Or how could the separate buildings have their lines directed by the one chief Cornerstone? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span> is not "every house of Israel," but "all the house of Israel." <span class="cmt_word">Fitly framed together.</span> There is a jointing and joining of the various parts to each other, forming a symmetrical, compact, well-ordered building. The Church has many members in one body, and all members have not the same office. It is a co-operative body, each aiding in his own way and with his own talent. The Church is not a collection of loose stones and timbers; its members are in vital union with Christ, and ought to be in living and loving and considerate fellowship with each other. <span class="cmt_word">Groweth into a holy temple in the Lord.</span> Increase is an essential property of the Church; wherever there is life there is growth. But the growth of the Church is not mere increase of members or size; the growth is <span class="accented">towards</span> a temple, of which the character is holy, and it is in the Lord. The world-famed temple of Diana at Ephesus may have been in the apostle's mind - its symmetry, its glory, the relation of each several part to the rest and to the whole, as a suitable external emblem of the spiritual body which is being built up in Christ; but the Christian Church is a <span class="accented">holy</span> temple, dedicated to God, purified by his Spirit, entirely foreign to those defilements which disgraced the temple of Diana. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span> at the beginning of the verse is followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span> at the end, as if the union of the Church to Christ could not be too often brought out. In him we are born into it; in him we grow in it; in him the whole temple grows towards the final consummation, when the <span class="accented">topstone</span> shall be brought out with shouts of "Grace, grace unto it." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-22 The church is compared to a city, and every converted sinner is free of it. It is also compared to a house, and every converted sinner is one of the family; a servant, and a child in God's house. The church is also compared to a building, founded on the doctrine of Christ; delivered by the prophets of the Old Testament, and the apostles of the New. God dwells in all believers now; they become the temple of God through the working of the blessed Spirit. Let us then ask if our hopes are fixed on Christ, according to the doctrine of his word? Have we devoted ourselves as holy temples to God through him? Are we habitations of God by the Spirit, are we spiritually-minded, and do we bring forth the fruits of the Spirit? Let us take heed not to grieve the holy Comforter. Let us desire his gracious presence, and his influences upon our hearts. Let us seek to discharge the duties allotted to us, to the glory of God.</body></html>
