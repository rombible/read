Which was given me according to the working of his power. This denotes the manner of the gift; the gift itself, apostleship to the Gentiles, would have been little had it not been accompanied with Divine power. Spiritual office without spiritual power is miserable; but in Paul's case there was the power as well as the office; not merely the power of working miracles, as some have held, but besides this, the power of spiritual insight into the meaning of Scripture - power of exposition, power of demonstration, power of persuasion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>, etc.). Paul gratefully acknowledged that all the power of his ministry was God's, not his own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6, 7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 For having preached the doctrine of truth, the apostle was a prisoner, but a prisoner of Jesus Christ; the object of special protection and care, while thus suffering for him. All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.</body></html>
