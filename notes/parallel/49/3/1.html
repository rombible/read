The first (carrying on what is implied in the contrast drawn out in Ephesians 2) is the absolute newness of this dispensation to the Gentiles--a mystery hidden from the beginning in God, but now at last revealed. The second, an emphatic claim for St. Paul himself, "less than the least" although he is, of a special apostleship to the Gentiles, proclaiming this mystery by word and deed.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">For this cause . . .</span>--After much discussion of the construction of this verse, there seems little doubt that the nominative, "I, Paul," must be carried on beyond the digression upon the mystery of the gospel, and his part in ministering it, which follows. The only question which can well be raised is whether the resumption takes place at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>, "I desire that ye faint not;" or at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm" title="For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,">Ephesians 3:14</a>, "I bow my knees;" and this seems decided for the latter alternative, both by the emphatic repetition of "for this cause," and by the far greater weight and finality of the latter sentence.<p><span class= "bld">The prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>--The phrase (repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm" title="Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.">Philemon 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm" title="Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;">2Timothy 1:8</a>) is dwelt upon with an emphasis, explained by St. Paul's conviction that "his bonds" tended to "the furtherance of the gospel"--not merely by exciting a sympathy which might open the heart to his words, but even more (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Philippians 1:13-14</a>) by showing the victorious power of God's word and grace--which "is not bound"--to triumph over captivity and the danger of death. The expression itself is notable. When St. Paul calls himself the "prisoner of Jesus Christ," he represents our Lord's own will, as ordaining his captivity for His own transcendent purposes of good, making him an "ambassador in chains" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>), and these "the bonds of the gospel." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm" title="Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:">Philemon 1:13</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>, "For the hope of Israel I am bound in this chain.") Hence in this passage St. Paul seems to speak of his captivity as a special proof of the reality of his mission, and a new step in its progress; and appeals to it accordingly, just as in the final salutation of the Colossian Epistle, "Remember my bonds." The whole idea is a striking instance of the spiritual alchemy of faith, turning all things to good--not unlike the magnificent passage (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.">2Corinthians 11:23-30</a>) of his "glorying in his infirmities."<p><span class= "bld">For you Gentiles.</span>--This was literally true of the origin of his captivity, proceeding as it did from the jealousy of the Jews, excited by the free admission of the Gentiles to the Church; but the reference is not to be limited to this. St. Paul regards the captivity as only one incident in a mission sending him entirely to the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm" title="For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>). From these words the digression of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2-13</a> starts, bringing out the reality and greatness of that mission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - DIGRESSION ON THE ADMISSION OF THE GENTILES TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause.</span> The reference is not merely to the last statement or illustration, but to the whole view of the purpose of God toward the Gentiles unfolded in Ephesians it. The apodosis does not come in till ver. 14, at the beginning of which this conjunctive clause is repeated. <span class="cmt_word">I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles.</span> He introduces himself in order to make known the feelings which were roused in <span class="accented">his</span> soul towards them by the consideration of the privileges just enlarged on - especially to acquaint them with the <span class="accented">prayers</span> he offered for them (see vers. 14-19), and apparently with the indirect object of getting them to offer similar prayers for themselves. To justify this introduction of himself, he delicately introduces the fact of his being a prisoner on their behalf. What had brought him to Rome, what had made him appeal to Caesar, was his preaching the gospel <span class="accented">to the Gentiles</span>; indeed, the immediate occasion of his arrest at Jerusalem was the suspicion that he had taken Trophimus, an Ephesian, one of themselves, into the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>). By this allusion to the condition into which his regard for them had brought him, be conciliates sympathetic consideration of what is to follow. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 For having preached the doctrine of truth, the apostle was a prisoner, but a prisoner of Jesus Christ; the object of special protection and care, while thus suffering for him. All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.</body></html>
