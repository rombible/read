It is (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>) "Christ in you, the hope of glory." The indwelling of Christ (as here the construction of the original plainly shows) is not a consequence of the gift of the Spirit; it is identical with it, for the office of the Holy Spirit is to implant and work out in us the likeness of Christ. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16-20</a>, in immediate connection with the promise of the Comforter, we read: "I will not leave you orphaned; I will come to you." "Ye shall know that . . . ye are in me and I in you." Hence the life in the Spirit is described as "To me to live is Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a>); "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>). Faith is simply the condition of that indwelling of Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>), the opening of the door to Him that He may enter in.<p>The prayer is here complete, all that follows being but consequent from it. In accordance with the universal law of revelation, all is <span class= "ital">from</span> the Father, all is <span class= "ital">through</span> the Son vouchsafing to tabernacle in our humanity, all is <span class= "ital">by</span> the Spirit effecting that indwelling of Christ in each individual soul.<p><span class= "bld">That ye, being rooted and grounded in love.</span>--The phrase "ye, being," &c., stands in the original before the word "that," as a kind of link between the previous clause and this, which seems to describe the consequence of the indwelling of Christ--viz., first love, next comprehension, and finally growth into the fulness of God.<p>The expression "rooted and grounded" (<span class= "ital">i.e., founded</span>) contains the same mixture of metaphor as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm" title="For we are laborers together with God: you are God's husbandry, you are God's building.">1Corinthians 3:9</a>, of the tree and the building--a mixture so natural as to pass into common usage. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm" title=" Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.">Colossians 2:7</a>, "rooted and being built up in Him.") The idea implied in "rooted" is of the striking down deeper and spreading wider into the soil; in "founded" of the firm basis on which ultimately we rest. "In love:" Love is not itself the root or foundation (for this is Jesus Christ Himself), but the condition under which growth takes place. Generally that growth is upward, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a> : "Knowledge puffeth up, but love buildeth up;" or, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>, where the body is said "to build itself up in love." Here that growth is downward, deeper and deeper into the communion with God in Christ, as "faith is made perfect (or, <span class= "ital">efficient</span>) by love." As in relation to man, so also to God, love is at once the recognition of an existing unity between spirit and spirit, and a means--probably the only means--of making that unity energetic and deepening it continually. Hence love is the first consequence of the indwelling of Christ in the soul; and by it the soul becomes rooted and grounded in the unity, given by that indwelling, with man and God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</span> Reversing the usual order, the prayer begins (ver. 16) by asking the blessing of the Third Person of the Godhead; now we have a cluster of petitions connected with the Second Person. The first of these is for the indwelling of Christ in their hearts, as opposed to mere occasional visits or influences from Christ; the instrument by which this blessing is attained being their faith. Christ exercising a constant power within them, both in the active and passive movements of the heart, giving the sense of pardon and acceptance, molding the will, sweetening the emotions, enlightening and confirming the conscience, purifying the whole springs and principles of action. This to be secured by their faith, opening the door, receiving Christ in all his fullness, resting and living on him, believing his promises, and longing for his appearing the second time. <span class="cmt_word">In order that ye, having been rooted and grounded in love.</span> Two images are combined to make the idea emphatic - that of a tree and that of a building; denoting what is both the starting-point and the support of the Christian's life, viz. love. In what sense? The love of Christ is specified afterwards (ver. 19), but this may be as a pre-eminent branch of that manifold love which bears on the Christian life - the love of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the love of the brethren to one another; and the reciprocal love evoked from the believer by the reception of this love. Evidently it is implied that the Christian life can begin and flourish only in such an atmosphere of love; as warm sunshine is needed to start and advance the life of a plant, so love is needed to start and carry on the life of the soul. Experience of Divine love is a great quickening and propelling power. "One glance of God, a touch of his love, will free and enlarge the heart, so that it can deny all and part with all and make an entire renunciation of all to follow him" (Archbishop Leighton). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-19 The apostle seems to be more anxious lest the believers should be discouraged and faint upon his tribulations, than for what he himself had to bear. He asks for spiritual blessings, which are the best blessings. Strength from the Spirit of God in the inner man; strength in the soul; the strength of faith, to serve God, and to do our duty. If the law of Christ is written in our hearts, and the love of Christ is shed abroad there, then Christ dwells there. Where his Spirit dwells, there he dwells. We should desire that good affections may be fixed in us. And how desirable to have a fixed sense of the love of God in Christ to our souls! How powerfully the apostle speaks of the love of Christ! The breadth shows its extent to all nations and ranks; the length, that it continues from everlasting to everlasting; the depth, its saving those who are sunk into the depths of sin and misery; the height, its raising them up to heavenly happiness and glory. Those who receive grace for grace from Christ's fulness, may be said to be filled with the fulness of God. Should not this satisfy man? Must he needs fill himself with a thousand trifles, fancying thereby to complete his happiness?</body></html>
