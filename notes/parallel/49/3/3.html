By revelation, not by the wisdom of man (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1Corinthians 2:7-16</a>): for "God hath revealed them to us by His Spirit." By direct revelation to St. Paul himself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>, "not of man or by man, but by revelation of Jesus Christ," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>, "according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery." (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2Corinthians 12:17</a>.) This revelation we may refer especially to the time when, after his conversion, he was "in a trance while praying in the Temple," and "saw Christ Himself," saying unto him, "Depart, for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As I wrote afore in few words.</span>--The reference is to the brief notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10-14</a>, and to the further explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>. Hence, in English, the idea would be more clearly expressed by "I have written above." St. Paul refers them back to these passages as embodying his "understanding," or conception, of the mystery thus revealed especially to him. The reference is one of those parenthetical remarks, which, to those remembering how St. Paul's Epistles were dictated, almost irresistibly suggest insertion on the reading over of the Epistle.<p>-3<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-20.htm" title="Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,">Ephesians 3:20-21</a> sum up the whole in a doxology to God the Father through Christ Jesus. It may be compared with the other more solemn doxologies in the New Testament: as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-15.htm" title="For some are already turned aside after Satan.">1Timothy 5:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jude/1-24.htm" title="Now to him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,">Jude 1:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>. Each has its distinctive character. Here the prevailing idea of the preceding chapters is the wonder and the mystery of God's fore-ordaining love, overflowing in the riches of His grace to those who are made one with Him and with each other in Christ Jesus. Hence, God is here described as He "who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think," and to do all "by His power dwelling" and working in us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How that, by revelation, was made known unto me the mystery.</span> The mystery, as is explained afterwards (ver. 6), was not the gospel itself, but its destination to the Gentiles as much as to the Jews; although, as appears afterwards, this fullness of blessing is really the great glory of the gospel. Mystery, that which is known only to the initiated, does not denote here a thing obscure in its own nature, but only something that had been concealed from view. It was only the initiated that now knew that God designed the gospel for Gentile and Jew alike. Paul had been initiated "by revelation" - not by his own reflecting power, not by his study of Scripture, not by communication from ether men, but by a special communication from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As I wrote before in few words.</span> Where? In another Epistle? No; but in the earlier part of this Epistle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>, etc.). If it be said the allusions in these places to the topic in question are rather vague and general, the apostle virtually admits it - he wrote of it "in few words;" but, as it is a great and glorious truth, he returns to it to amplify it and place it in a brighter light. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 For having preached the doctrine of truth, the apostle was a prisoner, but a prisoner of Jesus Christ; the object of special protection and care, while thus suffering for him. All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.</body></html>
