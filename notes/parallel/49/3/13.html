(See this idea more fully worked out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-12.htm" title="But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;">Philippians 1:12-29</a>.) "To faint" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;">2Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm" title="And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.">Galatians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="But you, brothers, be not weary in well doing.">2Thessalonians 3:13</a>) is "to play the coward," as "thinking it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/4-12.htm" title="Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:">1Peter 4:12-13</a>) a strange thing" that trouble should fall on him or them. It might well seem strange, when for four years at least, at Caesarea and Rome, the marvellous activity of St. Paul's Apostolic career was apparently cut short.<p><span class= "bld">At my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</span>--There is a peculiar beauty in the thought suggested by the words "which is your glory." The suffering, triumphantly borne and actually turned to the furtherance of the gospel, is certainly a "glory," in the proof which it gives of the power of the truth and the grace of Christ. But the more obvious idea would have been to comfort the Ephesians by the declaration that St. Paul's tribulations were to himself a cause, not of pain, but of joy and glory--as is, in fact, done in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>, and in the celebrated passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.">2Corinthians 11:23-31</a>. Here, however, instead of so doing, St. Paul pursues the same line of thought as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised.">1Corinthians 4:10</a>--there half ironically, here seriously--that, while the suffering falls on himself, the glory passes to the Church, for which he suffers, and in which he is content to sink himself. Hence he bids the Ephesians find encouragement and glory for themselves,<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore I beg that ye faint not at my tribulations for you.</span> A very delicate and touching request, that they would not be too much distressed by what he was suffering for them (comp. Epaphroditus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-26.htm">Philippians 2:26</a>). Paul knew that the sympathy was so strong that what was suffered by him was endured sympathetically by them. Two expressions denote that the sufferings were great: "My tribulations for you" - a word expressing intense and protracted suffering; "that <span class="accented">ye faint not</span>," or that ye do not lose heart, as if the power of evil had got the upper hand. <span class="cmt_word">Which is your glory.</span> That is, the character or capacity of the apostle of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, in which I suffer tribulation, is one of such exalted dignity as to reflect glory on you. Take that view of my sufferings; I suffer because I hold so glorious an office, and the glory of that office is reflected on you. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-19 The apostle seems to be more anxious lest the believers should be discouraged and faint upon his tribulations, than for what he himself had to bear. He asks for spiritual blessings, which are the best blessings. Strength from the Spirit of God in the inner man; strength in the soul; the strength of faith, to serve God, and to do our duty. If the law of Christ is written in our hearts, and the love of Christ is shed abroad there, then Christ dwells there. Where his Spirit dwells, there he dwells. We should desire that good affections may be fixed in us. And how desirable to have a fixed sense of the love of God in Christ to our souls! How powerfully the apostle speaks of the love of Christ! The breadth shows its extent to all nations and ranks; the length, that it continues from everlasting to everlasting; the depth, its saving those who are sunk into the depths of sin and misery; the height, its raising them up to heavenly happiness and glory. Those who receive grace for grace from Christ's fulness, may be said to be filled with the fulness of God. Should not this satisfy man? Must he needs fill himself with a thousand trifles, fancying thereby to complete his happiness?</body></html>
