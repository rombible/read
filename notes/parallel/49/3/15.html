The translation is tempting, yielding a grand sense, and one thoroughly accordant with the treatment of the earthly relationship below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-1.htm" title="Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.">Ephesians 6:1-4</a>). But the usage of the word is clearly against it; and we must render it <span class= "ital">every family</span>--that is, every body of rational beings in earth or heaven united under one common fatherhood, and bearing the name (as in a family or clan) of the common ancestor. Such bodies are certainly the first germs or units of human society; what their heavenly counterparts may be, who can tell? The Apostle looks upon the fathers whose names they delight to bear as the imperfect representatives of God, and upon the family itself, with its head, as the type in miniature of the whole society of spiritual beings united in sonship to the Father in heaven. Hence he declares that it is ultimately from Him that every family derives the name of <span class= "ital">patria, </span>and by that very name bears witness to the Divine Fatherhood, on which he desires here to lay especial stress.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named.</span> So A.V., but R.V. has "every family," holding, doubtless, that the want of the article - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f21;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> - requires this sense. But as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-13.htm">Luke 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>.36; 7:22, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; so here, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> without the article may denote the totality of the thing; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> corresponding <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>. And this seems more in accord with the scope of the passage, for here the apostle is not distributing into groups, but gathering into one. But what is the precise import of the statement, and for what reason is it introduced? The apostle recognizes all saints, whether in heaven or on earth, as forming one family, and as the whole family derives its name from God, so God may ha expected and appealed to to make full and corresponding provision for the wants of its various sections. The implied appeal is not to the fact that the family is God's family, but to the fact, less important in itself but really including the other, that it is named after him. Among men, one would be held emphatically bound to take an interest in those who are not only his relations but bear his very name. Now, that part of the family which is housed in heaven is gloriously provided for; the apostle proceeds to intercede for the portion still on earth. As the whole family is named after the same Father, is conspicuous before the eyes of all as God's, so it may well be expected that the more needy, feeble, exposed, and tempted part of the family will be treated in every way worthy of its Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Let saints on earth unite to sing<br />With those to glory gone;<br />For all the servants of our King,<br />In earth and heaven, are one.<br />"One family we dwell in him,<br />One Church above, beneath;<br />Though now divided by the stream,<br />The narrow stream, of death."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-19 The apostle seems to be more anxious lest the believers should be discouraged and faint upon his tribulations, than for what he himself had to bear. He asks for spiritual blessings, which are the best blessings. Strength from the Spirit of God in the inner man; strength in the soul; the strength of faith, to serve God, and to do our duty. If the law of Christ is written in our hearts, and the love of Christ is shed abroad there, then Christ dwells there. Where his Spirit dwells, there he dwells. We should desire that good affections may be fixed in us. And how desirable to have a fixed sense of the love of God in Christ to our souls! How powerfully the apostle speaks of the love of Christ! The breadth shows its extent to all nations and ranks; the length, that it continues from everlasting to everlasting; the depth, its saving those who are sunk into the depths of sin and misery; the height, its raising them up to heavenly happiness and glory. Those who receive grace for grace from Christ's fulness, may be said to be filled with the fulness of God. Should not this satisfy man? Must he needs fill himself with a thousand trifles, fancying thereby to complete his happiness?</body></html>
