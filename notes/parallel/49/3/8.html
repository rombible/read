Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.">1Corinthians 15:9-10</a>, the feeling that he is "the least of the Apostles, not meet to be called an Apostle," rises out of the contemplation of the special manifestation of the risen Lord to him as "one born out of due time;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.">2Corinthians 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.">2Corinthians 12:9-11</a>, "boasting" has been forced upon him, and so, having been compelled to dwell on the special work done by him, and the special revelations vouchsafed to him, he immediately adds, "though I am nothing;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12-16</a>, as also here, it is the greatness of his message of universal salvation which reminds him that he was "a persecutor and injurious," "the chief of sinners," and "less than the least of all saints." Elation in the sense of privilege--"the glorying in that which we have received," so emphatically rebuked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="For who makes you to differ from another? and what have you that you did not receive? now if you did receive it, why do you glory, as if you had not received it?">1Corinthians 4:7</a>--is the temptation of the first superficial enthusiasm; deep sense of weakness and unworthiness, the result of second and deeper thought, contrasting the heavenly treasure with the earthen vessels which contain it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7</a>). Possibly there is a "third thought," deeper still, belonging to the times of highest spiritual aspiration, which loses all idea of self, even of weakness and unworthiness, in the thought of "the strength made perfect in weakness," and the consciousness (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-12.htm" title="I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.">Philippians 4:12-13</a>) that "we can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth us." See this last brought out in peculiar fulness and freedom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.">2Corinthians 5:13</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-10.htm" title="As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.">2Corinthians 6:10</a>; a passage almost unique in its disclosure of spiritual experience.<p><span class= "bld">The unsearchable riches of Christ.</span>--The word "unsearchable" properly carries with it the metaphor (latent in our word "investigate") of tracking the footsteps, but not tracking them completely to their source or issue--thus gaining an evidence of a living power, but "not knowing whence it cometh or whither it goeth." In this proper sense it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a>, "How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!" (as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-9.htm" title="Which does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:">Job 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-10.htm" title="Which does great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.">Job 9:10</a>). Here it is used in a slightly different sense--applied to that "wealth" or fulness of Christ on which this Epistle lays such especial stress, as a wealth of truth which we can see in part but cannot wholly measure, and a wealth of grace which we can enjoy but cannot exhaust.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints</span>; not only of apostles and prophets, but even of all believers - a profound expression of humility, founded not only on his persecuting career, but on his consciousness of sin, of inborn rebellion against God's Law, of fountains of unlawful desire in his flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13-15</a>), making him feel himself to be, in heart and essence, the chief of sinners. The sense of sin is not usually in proportion to the acts of outward transgression, but to the insight into the springs of evil in one's heart, and the true nature of sin as direct antagonism to the holy God. <span class="cmt_word">Was this grace given.</span> The third time in this chapter that he speaks of his office as a fruit of grace, showing that, notwithstanding his being a prisoner on account of it, and all the perils it involved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24-27</a>), he was overwhelmed with God's unmerited goodness in conferring it on him. It was substantially the post of a foreign missionary, with hardly one human comfort! <span class="cmt_word">To preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> evangelize, to proclaim good tidings. The force of the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;</span> is not given in "preach," but the idea is amply conveyed by the words that follow. The balance of authority for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "to the Gentiles," and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "among the Gentiles," is about equal; the meaning really the same. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, heathen, was almost an offensive name; yet with that name the apostle associates the highest blessings of God. <span class="accented">The unsearchable riches of Christ</span>; two attractive words, <span class="accented">riches</span> and <span class="accented">unsearchable</span>, conveying the idea of the things that are most precious being infinitely abundant. Usually precious things are rare; their very rarity increases their price; but here that which is most precious is also boundless - riches of compassion and love, of merit, of sanctifying, comforting, and transforming power, all without limit, and capable of satisfying every want, craving, and yearning of the heart, now and evermore. The thought of his having such riches to offer to all made him regard his office as most glorious, raised him far above the point of view from which the world would despise it, and filled him with adoring gratitude to God for having conferred it on him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-12 Those whom God advances to honourable employments, he makes low in their own eyes; and where God gives grace to be humble, there he gives all other needful grace. How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ! Though many are not enriched with these riches; yet how great a favour to have them preached among us, and to have an offer of them! And if we are not enriched with them it is our own fault. The first creation, when God made all things out of nothing, and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures by converting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. His riches are as unsearchable and as sure as ever, yet while angels adore the wisdom of God in the redemption of his church, the ignorance of self-wise and carnal men deems the whole to be foolishness.</body></html>
