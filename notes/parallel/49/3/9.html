The phrase used in the original is at once stronger and weaker than our version of it. It is stronger, for the word is, properly, <span class= "ital">to enlighten</span> or illuminate--the same word used above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>), "the eyes of your heart being enlightened." Strictly, Christ alone is the Light of the world, "which enlightens every man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-2.htm" title="And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.">John 8:2</a>); but, as reflecting Him, He declared His servants to be the "light of the world." Yet it is weaker, for while we can enlighten, it is our daily sorrow that we cannot "make men see." Even He wept over Jerusalem because His light was, by wilful blindness, "hidden from their eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>). To "open the eyes, and turn men from darkness to light," although (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>) attributed in general terms to the servants of God, because naturally following on their ministry, is properly the work of the Holy Spirit, even in relation to the words of our Lord Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The fellowship of the mystery.</span>--Both MS. authority and internal evidence point here to "the <span class= "ital">dispensation</span> of the mystery" as the true reading. Probably here the reference is not to the commission of the mystery to the Apostle (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a>), but (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>) to the law or order which God Himself has ordained for the manifestation of the truth, both to men and angels.<p><span class= "bld">Who created all things by Jesus Christ.</span>--The words "by Jesus Christ" should be omitted, probably having crept in from a gloss, and not belonging to the original. The description of God as "He who created all things," material and spiritual, is here emphatic--designed to call attention to the dispensation of the gospel as existing in the primeval purpose of the Divine Mind (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1Corinthians 1:7</a>), hidden from the beginning of the world (properly, <span class= "ital">from the ages</span>) till the time of its revelation was come. The New Testament constantly dwells on this view of the Mediation of Christ, as belonging in some form to the relation of humanity to God in itself, and not merely to that relation as affected by the Fall; but nowhere with greater emphasis than in the profound and universal teaching of these Epistles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery.</span> Another branch of his office, and another fruit of God's grace in conferring it. He was not only to benefit man, but also to vindicate God. For "fellowship of the mystery" (A.V.), the R.V. has "dispensation of the mystery," founded on the preference of the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, for which there is a great preponderance of authority over <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. It was the apostle's function to show how this mystery had been dispensed - concealed for a long time and at last revealed. <span class="cmt_word">Which from the beginning of the ages hath been hid in God.</span> The counsel itself was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, before the foundation of the world; the concealment of it <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, from the beginning of the ages, when there were intelligent beings capable of understanding it - whether angels or men. Whatever the angels may have known of the Divine plans, this feature of them was not known till revealed to the New Testament Church. <span class="cmt_word">Who created all things.</span> The reason for adding this particular designation of God is not obvious; probably it is to indicate the relation of the matter in hand to the mightiest works of God. This is no trifling matter; it connects itself with God's grandest operations; it has supremely glorious bearings. It might be supposed to have relations only to one race and to one period of time; but it has relations to "all things;" it is an integral element in God's plan. The words, by <span class="cmt_word">Jesus Christ</span> (A.V.), are not found in a great preponderance of textual authorities. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-12 Those whom God advances to honourable employments, he makes low in their own eyes; and where God gives grace to be humble, there he gives all other needful grace. How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ! Though many are not enriched with these riches; yet how great a favour to have them preached among us, and to have an offer of them! And if we are not enriched with them it is our own fault. The first creation, when God made all things out of nothing, and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures by converting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. His riches are as unsearchable and as sure as ever, yet while angels adore the wisdom of God in the redemption of his church, the ignorance of self-wise and carnal men deems the whole to be foolishness.</body></html>
