Hence, in all cases, it leads back to the idea of Predestination, that is, of the conception of the divine purpose in the mind of God, before its realisation in actual fact. On the doctrine of predestination see Romans 9. It will suffice to note that here (1) its source is placed in God's love; (2) its meritorious cause is the mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ; (3) its result is adoption, so that He is (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>) "the firstborn of many brethren," who are conformed to His image, and redeemed by Him from bondage to sonship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>). (It is clear that the adoption here is not the final adoption of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; but the present adoption into the Christian covenant, there called "the firstfruits of the Spirit;") (4) it is in itself the expression of "the good pleasure of His will" on which all ultimately depends; and (5) its final purpose is to show forth God's glory in the gift of His grace. In a few words the whole doctrine is summed up, with that absolute completeness, so eminently characteristic of this Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">According to the good pleasure of his will.</span>--In our version, "good pleasure," there is an ambiguity, reproducing the ambiguity of the original. The word used may signify (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-26.htm" title="Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in your sight.">Matthew 11:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm" title="In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in your sight.">Luke 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm" title="For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.">Philippians 2:13</a>) simply God's free will, to which this or that "seemeth good," or (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-14.htm" title="And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.">Luke 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-1.htm" title="Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.">Romans 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Philippians 1:15</a>) "His good will towards us." Even the old Greek interpreters were divided upon it, and either sense will suit this passage. But the close parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:">Ephesians 1:11</a>, "according to the counsel (<span class= "ital">deliberate purpose</span>) of His will," turns the balance in favour of the former rendering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having predestinated</span> (or, <span class="accented">foreordained</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>us to adoption through Jesus Christ unto himself.</span> The same idea is denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in this verse and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in ver. 3, but while in <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> the idea of selection out from among others is prominent, in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> the special phase of thought is that of the <span class="accented">time</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span>, before - before the foundation of the world. Both denote the exercise of Divine sovereignty. In ver. 4 we have the <span class="accented">ultimate</span> purpose of God's decree the entire sanctification of the elect; here, in ver. 5, we find one of the intermediate steps of the process - adoption. The apostle's reason for speaking of adoption in this place, and of justification afterwards, is that be bad just referred to the restoration of <span class="accented">a relation of lore</span> between us and God as connected with our ultimate complete sanctification; thus it was natural for him to bring in our <span class="accented">adoption</span> as the preordained act in which this loving relation is formed. Our obedience is not the forced obedience of servants, but the loving obedience of sons. Adoption implies more than sentiment - a real legal relation to God as his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). The adoption is "by Jesus Christ:" "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>). And it is <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, unto or into himself - denoting a movement towards God which terminates in union to Him. <span class="cmt_word">According to the good pleasure of his will.</span> The spring or motive to the selection is solely in God, not in man. It is an act of sovereignty. It has been disputed whether "the good pleasure of his will" is equivalent to <span class="accented">benevolentia</span> or to <span class="accented">bene placitum</span>. Parallel passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a> lead us to prefer the latter. The idea of kindness is not excluded, but it is not what is affirmed. Kindness is always involved in the Divine will; but the point here is simply that it pleased God to choose and ordain the Ephesian believers to the privilege of adoption through Jesus Christ. This is presented as a ground of praise, a reason for their blessing God. The Divine sovereignty is not presented in Scripture to <span class="accented">seekers</span>, but <span class="accented">to finders</span>. It is apt to embarrass those that seek; and accordingly the aspect of God's character presented to them is his good will to men, his free offer of mercy: "Look unto me, and be ye saved;" "Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out." But it is a ground of thanksgiving to those who <span class="accented">hare accepted</span> the offer; they see that before the foundation of the world God chose them in Christ. What an interest he must have had in them, and how thoroughly they may rely on his finishing the work he has begun! Divine sovereignty, human responsibility, and the free and universal offer of mercy are all found in Scripture, and, though we are unable to harmonize them by our logic, ought all to have a place in our minds. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:3-8 Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which we cannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. The believer's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divine mercy.</body></html>
