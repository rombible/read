In St. Peter's First Epistle, on the other hand, addressed to those "scattered" through many churches, we have an opening exactly similar to the opening of this Epistle. There is, indeed, here a thanksgiving below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15-22</a>), but it is entirely general, belonging to the whole Church.<p><span class= "bld">The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>--On this phrase (used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm" title="That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>) see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm" title="That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 15:6</a>. It is, however, to be noted here, that in the Vatican MS. the words "and Father" are omitted, and that the phrase "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ" occurs below in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Blessed be . . . who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings.</span>--The frequent phrase "Blessed be God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.

We can "bless" God only in thanksgiving of heart and voice, with which He deigns to be pleased, as He "rejoices over the works of His hands." God blesses us in real and life-giving "spiritual blessing," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>blessing of the gift of the Spirit, for which we can return nothing except thanksgiving. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/116-12.htm" title="What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits toward me?">Psalm 116:12-13</a>, the natural question of the thoughtful soul--"What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits towards me?"--is answered simply by the words, "I will receive the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the Lord."<p><span class= "bld">Who hath blessed us . . . in heavenly-places.</span>--It should be, <span class= "ital">who blessed us</span> (once for all), in the election and predestination spoken of in the next verse. If this be noted, the sense of the phrase "in heavenly places" becomes far clearer. It has been doubted whether we ought to supply the word "places" or "things" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12</a>) in rendering this phrase, which is peculiar to this Epistle, and used in it no less than five times. In three out of the other four places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>) the local sense is manifest; in the fourth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>) and in this it might be doubtful. But (1) it is altogether unlikely that so unique a phrase would be used in two different senses; (2) the original word for "heavenly" has most properly and most usually a local meaning; (3) the transference of the thoughts to heaven above suits especially the whole tone of this Epistle and the parallel Epistle to the Colossians; and (4) the local sense agrees best with the context here, for the Apostle is speaking of the election "before the foundation of the world" as made by the foreknowledge of God in heaven, where Christ is "in the beginning with God."<p>It has been noticed here that we have one of those implicit references to the Holy Trinity--the blessing from God the Father, in Christ, and by the Spirit--with which St. Paul's Epistles abound.<p><span class= "bld">In Christ</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in the unity with Christ, which is "the life eternal," ordained for us in the foreknowledge of God, and viewed as already existing. (See the whole of John 17, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21-23</a>.)<p>(3) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15-23</a>, this introductory chapter ends in a prayer for the enlightenment of the readers of this Epistle, that they may understand all the fulness of the blessings of the gospel. In accordance with the heavenward direction of the thought of the whole Epistle, these blessings are viewed in their future completeness of glory and power, of which the present exaltation of the risen Lord to the right hand of God, as the Lord of all creatures, and the Head of the Church His body, is the earnest and assurance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-14.</span> - THANKSGIVING FOR THEIR DIVINE ORDINATION TO THE BLESSINGS OF GRACE. In this glorious anthem, in which the apostle, tracing all to the Divine Fountain, enumerates the glorious privileges of the Church, and blesses God for them, he first (ver. 3) states summarily the ground of thanksgiving, expanding it with glowing fullness in vers. 4-14. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every blessing of the Spirit, in heavenly places in Christ.</span> Here we have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Author of our blessings; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> their nature and sphere; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Medium through whom we have them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The Author is "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." Jesus called God his God and his Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>) in virtue of the state of subjection to him in which, as the Son of man, he had voluntarily placed himself. In this aspect and relation to Christ, God is here thanked because he hath blessed us in him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1fc4;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f76;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span>: not merely spiritual as opposed to material, but as <span class="accented">applied by the Holy Spirit</span>, the office of the Third Person being to bring Divine things into actual contact with human souls - to apply to us the blessings purchased by Christ; which blessings are <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> heavenly places. They belong to the heavenly kingdom; they are therefore the highest we can attain to. The expression occurs three times, and with the same meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;</span>. The Medium or Mediator through whom they come is Christ; they are not fruits of the mere natural bounty of God, but of his redeeming bounty - fruits of the mediatorial work of Jesus Christ. Thus, in this summary, we recognize what is eminently characteristic of this Epistle - the doctrine of the Trinity, and the function of each Person in the work of redemption. No other writing of the New Testament is so pervaded with the doctrine of the Trinity. The three great topics of the Epistle will be found to be considered in relation to the three Persons of the Trinity. Thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Origin and foundation of the Church, referred to the eternal counsel and good pleasure of the <span class="accented">Father</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The actual birth or existence of the Church with all its privileges, to the atoning grace and merit of the <span class="accented">Son</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The transformation of the Church, the realization of its end or purpose, in its final holiness and glory, to the sanctifying grace of the <span class="accented">Holy Spirit</span>. This throws light on the expression, "every blessing;" it includes <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> all that the Father can bestow; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> all that the Son can provide; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> all that the Spirit can apply. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The resources of all the three Persons thus conspire to bless the Church. In the verses that follow, the First Person is prominent in vers. 4-6; the second is introduced in vers. 6-12; and the third in vers. 13, 14. But all through the First Person is the great directing Power. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:3-8 Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which we cannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. The believer's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divine mercy.</body></html>
