They are not, however, decisive, for we have a similar expression to Philemon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-5.htm" title="Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;">Philemon 1:5</a>), St. Paul's own convert.<p>We may note a distinction between "faith in the Lord Jesus" and "faith towards the Lord Jesus" (like "the love towards the saints"). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 1:13</a> ("faith and love in Christ Jesus"). "Faith in Christ" is a faith which, centred in Christ, nevertheless rests through Him on the Father; recognising a "life hid with him in God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>) and a sonship of God in Christ Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>). The connection of the two clauses here shows that such a faith abounds (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> overflows) unto love, first necessarily to God, so being made perfect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>), but next towards all His children. For "this commandment we have from Him, that he who loveth God, love his brother also" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-21.htm" title="And this commandment have we from him, That he who loves God love his brother also.">1John 4:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-23.</span> - PRAYER FOR THEIR SPIRITUAL GROWTH. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore I also, having heard of the faith among you in the Lord Jesus, and your love which extends to all the saints.</span> The "wherefore" has reference to their present standing in grace, described in the verses preceding: since ye have heard, believed, been sealed, and thereby shown to be in the right line, I apply myself towards promoting your progress, towards advancing you to the higher stages of the Christian life. Special mention is made of their faith and love, as cardinal Christian graces, to which elsewhere the apostle adds hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>). The literal expression, "<span class="accented">faith</span> among you" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>), indicates that it was a marked social feature, but perhaps not universal; while their love was not mere general amiability, but a love that embraced the saints as such, having a special complacency in them, and being directed to them all. If it be asked - Could this knowledge of the condition of his correspondents have been derived from <span class="accented">hearsay</span> ("having heard") if the letter was addressed to the Ephesians, among whom Paul had lived so long, and whose condition he must have known by personal intercourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>)? we reply that, though he derived his first acquaintance from personal intercourse, it was some years since he had been at Ephesus, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> refers to what he had heard in the interval (see Introduction). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in his Son the Lord Jesus; but requires us to draw them out and fetch them in by prayer. Even the best Christians need to be prayed for: and while we hear of the welfare of Christian friends, we should pray for them. Even true believers greatly want heavenly wisdom. Are not the best of us unwilling to come under God's yoke, though there is no other way to find rest for the soul? Do we not for a little pleasure often part with our peace? And if we dispute less, and prayed more with and for each other, we should daily see more and more what is the hope of our calling, and the riches of the Divine glory in this inheritance. It is desirable to feel the mighty power of Divine grace, beginning and carrying on the work of faith in our souls. But it is difficult to bring a soul to believe fully in Christ, and to venture its all, and the hope of eternal life, upon his righteousness. Nothing less than Almighty power will work this in us. Here is signified that it is Christ the Saviour, who supplies all the necessities of those who trust in him, and gives them all blessings in the richest abundance. And by being partakers of Christ himself, we come to be filled with the fulness of grace and glory in him. How then do those forget themselves who seek for righteousness out of him! This teaches us to come to Christ. And did we know what we are called to, and what we might find in him, surely we should come and be suitors to him. When feeling our weakness and the power of our enemies, we most perceive the greatness of that mighty power which effects the conversion of the believer, and is engaged to perfect his salvation. Surely this will constrain us by love to live to our Redeemer's glory.</body></html>
