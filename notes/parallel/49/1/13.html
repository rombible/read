It is far better to refer the whole to the one verb, "ye were sealed." The irregularity of construction (arising from the addition to "hearing" of its proper accessory of "faith," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm" title="So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.">Romans 10:17</a>) will surprise no one who studies St. Paul's Epistles, and especially these Epistles of his Captivity, remembering that they were dictated, and in all probability read over again to the Apostle for addition or correction.<p><span class= "bld">After that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.</span>--There is a contrast hero between the Jewish believers, looking on in hope and gladly embracing its fulfilment, and the Gentiles, who had no such hope, and who therefore waited "for the word of the truth" (the full truth, not veiled in type or symbol), the glad tidings of a present salvation. The greater emphasis laid on the latter process seems intended to impress on the Gentiles a sense of the simpler and fuller means by which they were led to Christ.<p><span class= "bld">After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.--</span>The order is to be noted, and compared with the experience of the Day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>). First, the light of the gospel shines before men; next, by faith they open their eyes to see it; then they are sealed by a special gift of the Holy Spirit. Such faith is, of course, the gift of God by the Spirit; but our Lord teaches us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8-13</a>) to distinguish between the pleading of the Holy Spirit with "the world" "to convince of sin, because they believe not in Christ," and the special gift of His presence in the Church and the believing soul "to guide unto all the truth." This fuller presence is the seal of the new covenant.<p><span class= "bld">Ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.</span>--This word "sealed" is found in exactly the same connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2Corinthians 1:22</a>. The original idea of this sealing (which, it should be observed, is not of documents, but of men) is best seen in the "sealing of the servants of God in their foreheads," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3-8</a>. In that passage, and in the passage of Ezekiel which it recalls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 9:4</a>), the sealing is simply an outward badge, to be at once a pledge and means of safety amidst the destruction coming on the earth. In like sense, circumcision appears to be called "a seal" of previously existing righteousness of faith, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>; and the conversion of the Corinthians "a seal" of St. Paul's apostleship, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.">1Corinthians 9:2</a>. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm" title="He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.">John 3:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm" title="When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.">Romans 15:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2Timothy 2:19</a>.) But the word is used in a deeper sense whenever it is connected with the gift of the Holy Spirit. Then it corresponds to the "circumcision not made with hands" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>); it has the character of a sacrament, and is not a mere badge, but a true means of grace. In this connection we read first of our Lord, "Him God the Father sealed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>), with a clear reference to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at His baptism (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm" title="The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.">John 10:33</a>); next of His people (as here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2Corinthians 1:22</a>) as being, like Himself, baptised with the Holy Ghost. In this passage the very title given to the Spirit is significant. He is called (in the curious order of the original) "the Spirit of the Promise, the Holy One." "The promise" is clearly the promise in the Old Testament (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28-32</a>) of the outpouring of the Spirit on all God's people in "the latter days." The emphatic position of the epithet "Holy One" seems to point to the effect of His indwelling in the actual sanctification of the soul thus sealed. From this passage was probably derived the ecclesiastical application of the name "seal" to the sacrament of baptism, which is undoubtedly made the seal of conversion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whom are ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the good news of your salvation.</span> A.V. has "in whom ye also trusted," or hoped, supplying a verb from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>. 13, but without the prefix. This seems hardly natural, because the prefix <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> is characteristic and emphatic in ver. 12. It is a much less strain to supply simply <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;</span>, the important point being that you are now in him - in Christ. This expression, "in Christ," is one of the hinges of the Epistle; it occurs times almost without number, denoting the intimate vital union through faith between Christ and his people, as of the members to the head, in virtue of which they not only get the benefit of his atonement, but share his vital influences, live by faith on the Son of God. Having heard and received the truth as it is in Jesus, the glad tidings of salvation through a crucified Jesus, they became one with him, just as freely as did the believing Jews, and to the same blessed effects. More than that - <span class="cmt_word">in whom also having believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise</span>; thus receiving a new ground for thankfulness, a new proof of the riches of the grace of God. Many explain this seal of baptism, which undoubtedly seals Christ and all his blessings <span class="accented">to believers</span>. But though the seal of the Holy Spirit may have been given in and with baptism, it is not identical with baptism. The impression of it is partly within believers and partly without. Within, it is the felt result of the working of the Holy Spirit - the feeling of satisfaction and delight in the work and person of Christ, of love, confidence, and joy flowing out toward God, and the desire and endeavor in all things to be conformed to his will. Without, it is the fruit of the Spirit, the new man, created in righteousness and holiness after the image of Christ. Within, the Spirit bears witness with their spirits; without, the transformed life corroborates the inward witness, and gives it to the world. The first is never complete without the second, nor the second without the first. The spiritual history of believers is thus presented: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> hearing the truth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> believing; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> being sealed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Spirit is called the Spirit of the promise, because he is often promised in the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-1.htm">Joel 3:1</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God in all that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of his glory.</body></html>
