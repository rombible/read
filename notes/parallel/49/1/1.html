It may be contrasted, on the one hand, with the more formal enunciation of his commission, addressed to the Roman Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1-5</a>), and the indignant and emphatic abruptness of the opening of the Galatian Epistle--"an apostle not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>). On the other hand, to the Thessalonian churches, in the Epistles written shortly after their conversion, he uses no description of himself whatever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:">2Thessalonians 1:1</a>); in the Epistles to the Philippians and to Titus he is simply "the servant of Jesus Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>): to Philemon (for special reasons) "the prisoner of Jesus Christ." The phrase in the text stands midway between the emphasis of the one class of Epistles and the more familiar simplicity of the other.<p><span class= "bld">To the saints. . . . and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.</span>--Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-2.htm" title=" To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Colossians 1:2</a> ("the saints and faithful brethren") the same persons are described by both epithets. They are "saints," as "called" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm" title="To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1Corinthians 1:2</a>) into "the communion of saints" by the grace of God; they are "faithful," as by their own act believing in Christ and holding fast that faith. The two epithets are correlative to each other. Without the call and the grace of God, men cannot believe; without the energy of faith they cannot be, in effect as well as in opportunity, "saints." Both epithets belong in capacity and profession to all members of the Church militant; and St. Paul applies them accordingly to the whole body of any church which he addresses, without hesitation or distinction. In living reality they belong only to the "Invisible Church" of the present, which shall form the "Church triumphant" of the hereafter. It has been noted that the use of the word "saints," as the regular and ordinary name of Christians, is more especially traceable in the later Epistles of St. Paul. So in his speech before Agrippa he says, "Many of the saints did I shut up in prison" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-10.htm" title="And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.">Acts 27:10</a>). The phrase, "in Christ Jesus," belongs to both the words "saints" and "faithful;" but it is here more closely connected with the latter.<p><span class= "bld">Which are at Ephesus.</span>--On these words, omitted in the oldest MSS., see the <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus</span>. Paul's one but all-sufficient claim on the Ephesians is his relation to Christ: he is Christ's apostle, not only as sent forth by him, but also as belonging to him; elsewhere his servant or bondman. He makes no claim to their attention on the ground of his great experience in the gospel, his profound study of it, or even his gifts, but rests simply on his being Christ's apostle; thus recognizing Christ as the only Head of the Church, and source of authority therein. <span class="cmt_word">By the will of God.</span> The First Person of the Trinity, the Fountain of Godhead, has not only devised the whole scheme of mercy, but has likewise planned the subordinate arrangements by which it is carried out; thus it was by his will that Paul held the office of an apostle of Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>). His authority and his dignity as an apostle are thus the highest that can be: "He that heareth you, heareth me." <span class="cmt_word">To the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus.</span> This designation is expanded in the verses that immediately follow. "Saints" means set apart for God, and, as the result thereof, persons pure and holy; "faithful" is equivalent to "Believers;" while "in Christ Jesus" denotes the Source of their life, the element in which they lived, the Vine into which they were grafted. Such persons were the heart and nucleus of the Church, though others might belong to it. In the fervor of his salutations here and elsewhere, Paul seems to see only the genuine spiritual members of the Church; though afterwards he may indicate that all are not such (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm">Philippians 3:15</a>). With regard to the clause, "that are at Ephesus," see Introduction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1,2. All Christians must be saints; if they come not under that character on earth, they will never be saints in glory. Those are not saints, who are not faithful, believing in Christ, and true to the profession they make of relation to their Lord. By grace, understand the free and undeserved love and favour of God, and those graces of the Spirit which come from it; by peace, all other blessings, spiritual and temporal, the fruits of the former. No peace without grace. No peace, nor grace, but from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ; and the best saints need fresh supplies of the graces of the Spirit, and desire to grow.</body></html>
