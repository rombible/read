We note (1) that the word "dispensation" is usually applied to the action of the servants of God, as "dispensers of His mysteries." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-17.htm" title="For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me.">1Corinthians 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm" title=" Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;">Colossians 1:25</a>.)

Next (2) that the word "fulness," or <span class= "ital">completeness, </span>frequently used by St. Paul, is only found in connection with time in this passage, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a> ("when the fulness of time was come"). There, however, the reference is to a point of time, marking the completion of the preparation for our Lord's coming; here, apparently, to a series of "seasons," "which the Father hath put in His own power" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>) for the completion of the acts of the Mediatorial kingdom described in the words following. (Comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-3.htm" title="And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O you hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky; but can you not discern the signs of the times?">Matthew 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.">Luke 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.">1Thessalonians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm" title="Which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;">1Timothy 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-3.htm" title="But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;">Titus 1:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That he might gather together in one all things in Christ.</span>--In these words St. Paul strikes the great keynote of the whole Epistle, the UNITY OF ALL IN CHRIST. The expression "to gather together in one" is the same which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a> (where all commandments are said to be "briefly comprehended," or <span class= "ital">summed up, </span>"in the one saying, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"). Here, however, there is the additional idea that this gathering up is "for Himself." The full meaning of this expression is "to gather again under one head" things which had been originally one, but had since been separated. The best comment upon the truth here briefly summed up is found in the full exposition of the Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16-20</a>), "In Him were all things created, that are in heaven and that are in earth . . . all things were created by Him and for Him . . . and in Him all things consist. It pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell, and . . . by Him to reconcile all things to Himself . . . whether things on earth or things in heaven." In Christ, as the Word of God in the beginning, all created things are considered as gathered up, through Him actually made, and in Him continuing to exist. This unity, broken by sin, under the effect of which "all creation groans" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-22.htm" title="For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.">Romans 8:22</a>), is restored in the Incarnation and Atonement of the Son of God. By this, therefore, all things are again summed up in Him, and again made one in Him with the Father. In both passages St. Paul uses expressions which extend beyond humanity itself--"things in heaven and things in earth," "things visible and things invisible," "thrones and principalities and powers." In both he immediately proceeds from the grand outline of this wider unity, to draw out in detail the nearer, and to us more comprehensible, unity of all mankind in Christ. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>.) So also writes St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>), passing from the thought that "all things were made by Him," first to the declaration, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men," and next to the power given to those who believed on Him to become sons of God. The lesser part of this truth, setting forth the unity of all mankind in the Second Adam, forms the basis of the argument of 1 Corinthians 15, that "in Christ all shall be made alive," in the course of which the existence of the Mediatorial kingdom of Christ is described, and its continuance till the final triumph, when it "shall be delivered up to God, even the Father," "that God may be all in all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1Corinthians 15:28</a>). In virtue of it, those who are His are partakers of His death and resurrection, His ascension, even His judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?">1Corinthians 6:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1-3</a>).<p>(10, 11) <span class= "bld">Even in him: in whom also we have obtained an inheritance.</span>--We have here (in the repetition, "even in Him") an emphatic transition to the truth most closely concerning the Apostle and his readers. The word "we" is not here emphatic, and the statement might be a general statement applicable to all Christians; but the succeeding verse seems to limit it to the original Jewish believers--the true Israel, who (like the whole of Israel in ancient days) have become "a people of inheritance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm" title="But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as you are this day.">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-29.htm" title="Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your stretched out arm.">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-9.htm" title="For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>), so succeeding to the privileges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm" title="What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7</a>) which their brethren in blindness rejected. Possibly this suggests the peculiar word here (and here only) used, meaning either "we were made partakers of a lot" in God's kingdom (to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>, "who has made us meet for a part of the lot of the saints," closely corresponds), or "we were made His lot or inheritance;" which perhaps suits the Greek better, certainly accords better with the Old Testament idea, and gives a more emphatic sense. A third possible sense is "were chosen by lot." This is adopted by the Vulgate, supported by the only use of the word in the Septuagint (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-41.htm" title="Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.">1Samuel 14:41</a>), and explained by Chrysostom and Augustine as signifying the freedom of election without human merit, while by the succeeding words it is shown not to be really by chance, but by God's secret will. But this seems quite foreign to the genius of the passage.<p><span class= "bld">Being predestinated . . . that we should be to the praise of his glory.</span>--This is an application of the general truth before declared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-5.htm" title="Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,">Ephesians 1:5-6</a>) that the source of election is God's predestination, and the object of it the manifestation of His glory.<p><span class= "bld">After the counsel of his own will.</span>--The expression evidently denotes not only the deliberate exercise of God's will by "determinate counsel and foreknowledge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>), but also the guidance of that will by wisdom to the fulfilment of the Law Eternal of God's righteous dispensation. Hooker, in a well-known passage (<span class= "ital">Eccl. Pol.</span> i. 2), quotes it as excluding the notion of an arbitrary will of God, "They err, who think that of God's will there is no reason except His will."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With a view to the dispensation of the fullness of the times</span> (or, <span class="accented">seasons</span>) (vers. 9 and 10 are one sentence, which should not be broken up). This seems to denote the times of the gospel generally; not, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, the particular time of Christ's advent; the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or economy, of the gospel being that during which, in its successive periods, all God's schemes are to ripen or come to maturity, and be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">To gather together under one head all things in Christ.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is a word of some difficulty. It is true it is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>: therefore some have thought that it does not include the idea of <span class="accented">headship</span>; but the relation of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> is as close that this can hardly be. The word expresses the Divine purpose - what God <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b7;</span> was to restore in Christ a lost unity, to bring together disunited elements, viz. <span class="cmt_word">all things, whether they be things in heaven or things on earth.</span> There is no hint here of a universal restoration. Such a notion would be in fiat contradiction to the doctrine of Divine election, which dominates the whole passage. God's purpose is to form a united kingdom, consisting of the unfallen and the restored - the unfallen in heaven, and the restored on earth, and to gather this whole body together under Christ as its Head (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm">Ephesians 3:15</a>). We cannot say that this purpose has been fully effected as yet; but things are moving towards it, and one day it will be wholly realized. "He that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God in all that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of his glory.</body></html>
