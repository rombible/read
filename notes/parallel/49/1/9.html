The word "mystery" properly signifies a thing which (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>) "was hid from all ages, but is now made manifest." So our Lord evidently uses it (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm" title="And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all these things are done in parables:">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm" title="And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.">Luke 8:10</a>). For the rest, except in four passages of the Apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-5.htm" title="And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.">Revelation 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:7</a>), it is used by St. Paul alone, and by him no less than twenty-one times, of which ten belong to this Epistle and the parallel Epistle to the Colossians--always in connection with such words as "knowledge," "declaration," "dispensation." The ordinary sense of the word "mystery"--a thing of which we know that it is, though how it is we know not--is not implied in the original meaning of the word; but it is a natural derivative from it. Reason can apprehend, when revealed, that which it cannot discover; but seldom or never can it comprehend it perfectly. In this verse the mystery is declared to be accordant to the good pleasure of God's will, which (it is added) "He purposed <span class= "ital">in Himself."</span> In this seems to be implied that (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>) though in some sense we can know it, yet in its fulness "it passeth knowledge."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having made known unto us the mystery of his will</span>. The wide extent of God's grace was a <span class="accented">mystery</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hidden counsel, before Christ came and died, but it is now made known. In this, and not in the modern sense of mystery, the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used by Paul. The thing hidden and now revealed was not the gospel, but God's purpose with reference to its limits or sphere (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself.</span> The whole phraseology denotes that, in this transaction, God was not influenced by any external considerations; the whole reason for it sprang from within. The threefold expression brings this out: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to his good pleasure (see ver. 5); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he purposed, or formed a purpose; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in himself, without foreign aid, "For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counselor?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God in all that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of his glory.</body></html>
