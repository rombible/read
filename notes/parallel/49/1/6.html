So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18-19</a>, to the request, "Show me Thy glory," the answer is, "I will make my <span class= "ital">goodness</span> to pass before thee . . . and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-5.htm" title="And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.">Exodus 34:5-7</a>.) He is pleased to consider His glory best realised in the spectacle of souls redeemed and regenerate by His grace, and to decree that it should be thus realised for our sakes. "Wherefore would He have us praise and glorify Him? It is that our love to Him may be kindled more fervently. He desires not our service, nor our praise, nor anything else except our salvation" (Chrysostom's <span class= "ital">First Homily</span> on the Ephesians).<p><span class= "bld">Wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</span>--The verb here rendered "made us accepted," is the same verb used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-28.htm" title="And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.">Luke 1:28</a> (and nowhere else in the New Testament), where we translate "highly favoured." Etymologically it means to "bestow grace upon;" the tense here is the past tense, not the perfect Hence the meaning is (in connection with the previous clause), "His grace, which He bestowed upon us in the Beloved"--in virtue of our unity with "His beloved Son, in whom He is well pleased" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>). This special title is given to our Lord to mark a connection with the "love" declared in the last verse to be the source of God's predestination. It is a love to all mankind, as in God's foreknowledge already made one with His beloved Son. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.">John 17:25</a>, "Thou hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me . . . for Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world.")<p>(2 <span class= "ital">b.</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7-10</a> form the second section of this Introduction to the Epistle, linked to the former by the words, "in the Beloved." From the declaration in the former section of the source of salvation in God's love, it leads us on to the mystery of the Mediation of Jesus Christ, in Whom all Being is gathered up for redemption.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the praise of the glory of his grace</span>; with a view to praise being given to the glory of his grace. The purpose of grace <span class="accented">quoad</span> man, is to make him perfectly holy; <span class="accented">quoad</span> God, is to give to the universe a right conception of his grace, and draw forth corresponding tributes of praise. It is to show that Divine grace is not a limp, shallow attribute, but one of glorious riches, deserving infinite praise. The idea of the richness, fullness, abundance, of God's grace is prominent throughout the Epistle. God desires to draw attention, not only to this attribute, but to the boundlessness of it - thus to draw the love and confidence of his creatures to himself and inspire them with the desire to imitate him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21-35</a>). Wherein he abounded toward us in the Beloved. Two slight difficulties are found here - one in the text, the other in the interpretation. After <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, some copies read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;</span>, others <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. A.V. follows the former; R.V. the latter. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> usually means to bestow grace; sometimes, to make gracious or beautiful. The former is more in accordance with New Testament usage (Alford) and with the tenor of the passage. The glory of the grace of which God desires to create a true impression is not an abstraction, not a glory hidden away in stone inaccessible region, but a revealed glory, a communicated glory; it is revealed in the grace wherein he abounded to us, or which he freely bestowed on us, in the Beloved. The grace bestowed on believers exemplifies the glorious quality of the attribute - its glorious riches. The connection of God with Christ in the bestowal of this grace, and of believers in the reception of it, is again noted by the remarkable term, "in the Beloved." That the Father's relation to Christ was one of infinite love is a fact never to be lost sight cf. His having constituted the Beloved One the Kinsman and Mediator of sinners shows the riches of the glory of his grace. "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he hot, with him also freely give us all things?" Our union to the Beloved, our participating in all the blessings of his purchase, our becoming heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, further illustrates the glorious riches of his grace. "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:3-8 Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which we cannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance.
