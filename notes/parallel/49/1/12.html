But the meaning of the phrase "who first hoped" (or, more properly, <span class= "ital">who have hoped beforehand</span>) is less obvious. Our version seems to interpret it simply of "believing before" the Gentiles, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of being the "first believers;" and this interpretation may be defended by the analogy of certain cases in which the same prefix signifying "beforehand" has this sense (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.">Acts 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;">Romans 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-10.htm" title="Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;">Romans 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1Corinthians 11:21</a>). But the more general analogy strongly supports the other interpretation, "who have hoped in the Christ before He came"--that is, who, taught by prophecy, entering into that vision of a great future which pervades the older Covenant, looked forward "to the hope of Israel," and "waited for the consolation of Israel;" and who accordingly in due time became, on the Day of Pentecost, the firstfruits of His salvation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ.</span> The "we" which hitherto has been applied to the whole Church, Jewish and Gentile, begins to have a more limited reference, and to contrast with "you" in ver. 13. The first "we" in this verse embraces all, as in the preceding part of the chapter; the second (omitted in the A.V.) is conditioned by the words following, and is applicable to the Jewish Christians, who, through the promises given to the fathers, had seen Christ's day afar off, and had thus hoped in him. This special reference to <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> is followed immediately by a reference to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God in all that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of his glory.</body></html>
