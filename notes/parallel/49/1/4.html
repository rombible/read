This passage stands alone in St. Paul's Epistles in its use of this word "chosen" in connection with God's eternal purpose, "before the foundation of the world"--a phrase only applied elsewhere to the eternal communion of the Son with the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>), and to the foreordaining of His sacrifice in the divine counsels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>). The word "chosen" itself is used by our Lord of His choice of the Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16-19</a>); but in one case with the significant addition, "one of you is a devil," showing that the election was not final. It is similarly used in the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-2.htm" title="Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen:">Acts 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm" title="And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,">Acts 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-25.htm" title="It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,">Acts 15:25</a>) of His choice or the choice of the Apostles; and once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-7.htm" title="Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.">Acts 13:7</a>) of the national election of Israel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1Corinthians 1:27-28</a> (the only other place where it is used by St. Paul), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">James 2:5</a> it refers to choice of men by God's calling in this world. Clearly in all these cases it is applied to the election of men to privilege by an act of God's mercy here. In this passage, on the contrary, the whole reference is to the election "in Christ," by the foreknowledge of God, of those who should hereafter be made His members. From this examination of Scriptural usage it is clear that the visible election to privilege is constantly and invariably urged upon men; the election in God's eternal counsels only dwelt upon in passages which (like this or Romans 9, 11) have to ascend in thought to the fountain-head of all being in God's mysterious will. It will be observed that even here it clearly refers to all members of the Church, without distinction.<p><span class= "bld">That we should be holy and without blame before him.</span>--In these words we have the object of the divine election declared, and the co-operation of the elect implied, by the inseparable connection of holiness with election. There is an instructive parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a> :--"He hath reconciled you in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable, and unreprovable in His sight." The word "without blame," or "unblamable," is properly <span class= "ital">without blemish;</span> and the word "unreprovable" more nearly corresponds to our idea of one <span class= "ital">unblamable</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>one against whom no charge can be brought. Here God is said to have "chosen" us, in the other passage to have "presented" us (comp. the sacrificial use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>), in Christ, to be "holy and without blemish." It seems clear that the words refer not to justification in Christ, but to sanctification in Him. They express the positive and negative aspects of holiness; the positive in the spirit of purity, the negative in the absence of spot or blemish. The key to their interpretation is to be found in the idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>, "whom He did foreknow, He did predestinate to be <span class= "ital">conformed to the image of His Son."</span> The word "without blame" is applied to our Lord (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>) as a lamb "without blemish." To Him alone it applies perfectly; to us, in proportion to that conformity to His image. The words "before Him" refer us to God's unerring judgment as contrasted with the judgment of men, and even our own judgment on ourselves. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-3.htm" title="But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.">1Corinthians 4:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1John 3:20-21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In love.</span>--If these words are connected with the previous verse, they must be taken with "He hath chosen us," in spite of the awkwardness of the dislocation of order. But it is best to connect them with the verse following, "Having predestinated us in love."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he chose us out</span>, or <span class="accented">selected us</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) <span class="accented">for himself</span> (middle voice). The Father chose the heirs of salvation, selected those who were to be quickened from the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>) and saved, they chose them <span class="accented">in Christ - in</span> connection with his work and office as Mediator, giving them to him to be re-decreed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11, 12</a>); not after man was created, nor after man had fallen, but "before the foundation of the world." We are here face to face with a profound mystery. Before even the world was founded, mankind presented themselves to God as lost; the work of redemption was planned and its details arranged from all eternity. Before such a mystery it becomes us to put the shoes from off our feet, and bow reverently before him whose "judgments are unsearchable and his ways past finding out." <span class="cmt_word">That we should be holy and without blame before him in love.</span> This is obviously the design of God's electing act; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x31;&#x46;&#x43;&#x30;&#x3b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> cannot denote the ground, but the purpose, of the choice. God did not choose some because he foresaw their holiness, but in order that they might become "holy and without blame." These two terms denote the positive and negative sides of purity: holy - possessed of all the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>); without blame, or blemish - marked by no stain or imperfection (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>). The terms do not denote justification, but a condition of sanctification which implies justification already bestowed, but goes beyond it; our justification is a step towards our complete final sanctification. This renewal being "before him," must be such as to bear the scrutiny of his eye; therefore not external or superficial merely, but reaching to the very heart and center of our nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The expression further denotes how it is of the very nature and glory of the new life to be spent in God's presence, our souls flourishing in the precious sunshine which ever beams out there from. For, when thus renewed, we do not fly from his presence like Adam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>), but delight in it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>). Fear is changed to love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>); the loving relation between us and God is restored. It has been much disputed whether the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> ought to be construed with the fourth verse or with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the fifth. The weight of authority seems in favor of the latter; but we prefer the construction which is given both in the Authorized and the Revised Version, first, because if <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> qualified <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, it would come more naturally after it; and second, because the scope of the passage, the train of the apostle's thought, seems to require us to keep <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> in ver. 4. We never could come to be holy and without blemish before God unless the loving relations between us were restored (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>, "Rooted and grounded in love"). The spirit of love, trust, admiration, directed to God helps our complete sanctification - changes us into the same image (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:3-8 Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which we cannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. The believer's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divine mercy.</body></html>
