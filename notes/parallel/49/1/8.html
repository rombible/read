Of these two gifts, wisdom is clearly the higher gift, signifying (as in the Old Testament) the knowledge of the true end of life, which can only come from some knowledge of the "wisdom of God," that is, the divine purpose of His dispensation. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>.) Such knowledge is revealed to us through the "mind of Christ," who is Himself the true wisdom or "Word of God." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1Corinthians 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm" title="For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.">1Corinthians 2:16</a>.) Hence wisdom is spoken of in connection with various other gifts, which are but partial manifestations of it. Here with "prudence," that is, wisdom in action; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>, with "intelligence," that is, wisdom in judgment; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>, with "knowledge," that is, wisdom in perception; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a> of this chapter, with "revelation," the means by which wisdom is gained.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence</span>. This rendering of the R.V. is better than the A.V., "wherein he hath abounded," for <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> can hardly be put for the dative; it is genitive by attraction for the accusative. The wisdom and prudence refer to God; he has not made his grace abound to us in a random manner, but in a carefully regulated manner. This is more fully explained afterwards, in reference to God's concealment for a time of the universality of his grace, but manifestation of it now. Some have found a difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the one being theoretical wisdom and the other practical, or the one intellectual and the other moral; but possibly they may be meant merely to intensify the idea - the height of wisdom is shown in God's way of making his grace abound toward us (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:3-8 Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which we cannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. The believer's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divine mercy.</body></html>
