When his judgments have done their work, God will bring the heathen to the knowledge of him. He will purify their lips, which have been polluted with the names of idols and the worship offered to false gods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-17.htm">Hosea 2:17</a>); the confusion of Babel shall be done away, and all shall speak the language of faith in one God. This, of course, points to Messianic times. For "pure lip," the Vulgate has, <span class="accented">labium electum</span>; the LXX., by a mistake of a letter (<span class="accented">bhedurah</span> for <span class="accented">bherurah</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (so. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), "a tongue for her generation." <span class="cmt_word">With one consent;</span> literally, <span class="accented">with one shoulder</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "under one yoke" (Septuagint); <span class="accented">humero uno</span> (Vulgate).

The purifying doctrines of the gospel, or the pure language of the grace of the Lord, would teach men to use the language of humility, repentance, and faith. Purity and piety in common conversation is good. The pure and happy state of the church in the latter days seems intended. The Lord will shut out boasting, and leave men nothing to glory in, save the Lord Jesus, as made of God to them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Humiliation for sin, and obligations to the Redeemer, will make true believers upright and sincere, whatever may be the case among mere professors.</body></html>
