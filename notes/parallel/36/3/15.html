These God has removed; this is the first ground for rejoicing. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "thine iniquities." When God removes the punishments, he forgives the sin. <span class="cmt_word">He hath cast out</span> (<span class="accented">cleared quite away</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thine enemy.</span> The enemies who executed the judgment are utterly dispersed. <span class="cmt_word">The King of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-21.htm">Obadiah 1:21</a>). The theocracy is restored. Under the judgments which fell upon Israel, Jehovah seemed to have left his people; now he is in the midst of them as their icing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>). The perpetual presence of Christ in the Church is here adumbrated. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not see evil any more</span>. So the Septuagint. Another reading adopted by Jerome is, "Thou shalt not fear." In view of the following verse, this seems rather tautological. With God in their midst, the people shall see, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> experience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-12.htm">Jeremiah 5:12</a>), no evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-20 After the promises of taking away sin, follow promises of taking away trouble. When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes a people holy, will make them happy. The precious promises made to the purified people, were to have full accomplishment in the gospel. These verses appear chiefly to relate to the future conversion and restoration of Israel, and the glorious times which are to follow. They show the abundant peace, comfort, and prosperity of the church, in the happy times yet to come. He will save; he will be Jesus; he will answer the name, for he will save his people from their sins. Before the glorious times foretold, believers would be sorrowful, and objects of reproach. But the Lord will save the weakest believer, and cause true Christians to be greatly honoured where they had been treated with contempt. One act of mercy and grace shall serve, both to gather Israel out of their dispersions and to lead them to their own land. Then will God's Israel be made a name and a praise to eternity. The events alone can fully answer the language of this prophecy. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but they may rejoice in God's love. Surely our hearts should honour the Lord, and rejoice in him, when we hear such words of condescension and grace. If now kept from his ordinances, it is our trial and grief; but in due time we shall be gathered into his temple above. The glory and happiness of the believer will be perfect, unchangeable, and eternal, when he is freed from earthly sorrows, and brought to heavenly bliss.</body></html>
