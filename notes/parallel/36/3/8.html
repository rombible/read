Because of the outrage done to God's "long suffering," he must needs punish. Wait ye upon me; wait ye for me. The exhortation is addressed to the pious among the Jews, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-3.htm">Zephaniah 2:3</a>, and is used in a good sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>), urging them not to despair, but to be patient under the affliction, in the assured hope of salvation. The same expression is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>. I rise up to the prey. This is a phrase denoting effort and the effecting of some great object. Jehovah seizes the prey when the nations, roused by judgment inflicted, are converted unto him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>).

Jerome, "In die resurrectionis meae in futurum."

This is the reason of the severity and universality of the judgment The Masorites note that this ' the only verse in the Bible which contains the whole Hebrew alphabet. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The preaching of the gospel is predicted, when vengeance would be executed on the Jewish nation. The purifying doctrines of the gospel, or the pure language of the grace of the Lord, would teach men to use the language of humility, repentance, and faith. Purity and piety in common conversation is good. The pure and happy state of the church in the latter days seems intended. The Lord will shut out boasting, and leave men nothing to glory in, save the Lord Jesus, as made of God to them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Humiliation for sin, and obligations to the Redeemer, will make true believers upright and sincere, whatever may be the case among mere professors.</body></html>
