And the great help to this improvement is the abolition of the cause and incitement to sin. <span class="cmt_word">I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride</span> (<span class="accented">thy proud triumphers</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>).

The Gentiles should be admitted to the covenant, and share in their privileges. Here we see adumbrated the nature of the Christian Church, an organized body no longer local, insulated, but Catholic - a spiritual temple open to all believers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The preaching of the gospel is predicted, when vengeance would be executed on the Jewish nation. The purifying doctrines of the gospel, or the pure language of the grace of the Lord, would teach men to use the language of humility, repentance, and faith. Purity and piety in common conversation is good. The pure and happy state of the church in the latter days seems intended. The Lord will shut out boasting, and leave men nothing to glory in, save the Lord Jesus, as made of God to them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Humiliation for sin, and obligations to the Redeemer, will make true believers upright and sincere, whatever may be the case among mere professors.</body></html>
