The Anglican Version means that God would never cut them off wholly, however severely he might chastise them. The Hebrew will not carry this; nor are the Greek and Latin Versions quite correct.

"To rise early to do a thing" is a phrase used to signify the acting with zeal and full purpose (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-7.htm">Jeremiah 11:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Corrupted all their doings.</span> Like the inhabitants of the earth before the Flood (Corinthians 6:12; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>).

St. Jerome, moralizing on this, adds, "Nisi praeparati fuerimus, non nobis orietur sol justitiae.

A sinful state is, and will be, a woful state. Yet they had the tokens of God's presence, and all the advantages of knowing his will, with the strongest reasons to do it; still they persisted in disobedience. Alas, that men often are more active in doing wickedness than believers are in doing good.</body></html>
