The rivers of Cush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1</a>), are the Nile, the Atbara, and their affluents. <span class="cmt_word">My suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</span> From the ends of the earth, the Jews who have continued faithful to Jehovah, and have not lost their nationality among the Gentiles, but have considered themselves as belonging to "the dispersion," shall be again received of the Lord, and bring their oblations unto him. This may be the sense intended: but looking to the thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a> (where it is said that the Gentiles shall bring the Israelites out of all nations as a meat offering unto the Lord), we had better render the passage as the Revised Version margin, "They shall bring my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, for an offering unto me." The remote Gentiles shall show their faith in God by aiding the Hebrews among them to turn to the Lord; this shall be their offering to the true God, whom they have learned to adore. When they themselves are converted, they shall be evangelists to the Hebrews of the Dispersion. For this work of the Gentiles in converting the Hebrews, Wordsworth compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-4.htm">Song of Solomon 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-8.htm">Song of Solomon 8:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-5.htm">Isaiah 61:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-18.htm">Isaiah 65:18-21</a>. St. Paul speaks to the same effect in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6.htm">Romans 6</a>. <span class="accented">Offering</span> (<span class="accented">minehah</span>). The pure meal offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-10.htm">Malachi 1:10, 11</a>, where see notes; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). Dr. Briggs renders, "From beyond the rivers of Gush will be my incense (<span class="accented">athar</span>); the daughter of Phut will bring a minchah." This brings out the parallelism. The universal worship of Messianic times is expressed in the ceremonial terms of the old dispensation, but has a very real applicableness to the Christian religion (see note on Malachi 1:11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The preaching of the gospel is predicted, when vengeance would be executed on the Jewish nation. The purifying doctrines of the gospel, or the pure language of the grace of the Lord, would teach men to use the language of humility, repentance, and faith. Purity and piety in common conversation is good. The pure and happy state of the church in the latter days seems intended. The Lord will shut out boasting, and leave men nothing to glory in, save the Lord Jesus, as made of God to them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Humiliation for sin, and obligations to the Redeemer, will make true believers upright and sincere, whatever may be the case among mere professors.</body></html>
