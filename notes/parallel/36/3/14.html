After the late denunciation of woe and judgment, he soothes the faithful with the promise of the grace and peace which the time of Messiah shall bring. <span class="cmt_word">Sing, O daughter of Zion</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2.htm">Zechariah 2</a>:14; 9:9). He calls on the restored remnant of Judah to show its joy by outward tokens. <span class="cmt_word">O Israel.</span> All the tribes are to unite in praising God. This is one of the passages where "Israel" is supposed to have been written by mistake for "Jerusalem." So <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>. The LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span>, "daughter of Jerusalem" (see note on Zechariah 1:19). The prophet enjoins a triple note of exultation in order to confirm the universal joy. (On the use of the number "three" in this passage, see Dr. Pusey's note, p. 480.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-20 After the promises of taking away sin, follow promises of taking away trouble. When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes a people holy, will make them happy. The precious promises made to the purified people, were to have full accomplishment in the gospel. These verses appear chiefly to relate to the future conversion and restoration of Israel, and the glorious times which are to follow. They show the abundant peace, comfort, and prosperity of the church, in the happy times yet to come. He will save; he will be Jesus; he will answer the name, for he will save his people from their sins. Before the glorious times foretold, believers would be sorrowful, and objects of reproach. But the Lord will save the weakest believer, and cause true Christians to be greatly honoured where they had been treated with contempt. One act of mercy and grace shall serve, both to gather Israel out of their dispersions and to lead them to their own land. Then will God's Israel be made a name and a praise to eternity. The events alone can fully answer the language of this prophecy. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but they may rejoice in God's love. Surely our hearts should honour the Lord, and rejoice in him, when we hear such words of condescension and grace. If now kept from his ordinances, it is our trial and grief; but in due time we shall be gathered into his temple above. The glory and happiness of the believer will be perfect, unchangeable, and eternal, when he is freed from earthly sorrows, and brought to heavenly bliss.</body></html>
