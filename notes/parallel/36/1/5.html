This expression is used when God is about to do great things or inflict notable punishment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-12.htm">Exodus 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>, etc.). Judah. In so far as Judah was rebellious and wicked, it should incur the judicial punishment. Judgment was to begin at the house of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>), the sin of the chosen people being more heinous than that of heathens. Hence it is added, <span class="cmt_word">upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</span> because, having in their very midst the temple of God, with its services and priests, they ought especially to have abhorred idolatry and maintained the true faith. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Baal;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the last vestige. One cannot argue from this expression that the reform was already carried so far that Baal worship had almost disappeared. The next verse shows that idolatry still flourished; but the term implies merely that God would exterminate it so entirely that no trace of it should remain. The LXX. has, "the names of Baal," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-17.htm">Hosea 2:17</a>). (For Josiah's reform of these iniquities, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">The name of the Chemarims</span> (<span class="accented">Chemarim</span>). The word means "black-robed," and is applied to the idolatrous priests whom the kings had appointed to conduct worship in high places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>). "The name," says Dr. Pussy, "is probably the Syriac name of 'priest,' used in Holy Scripture of idolatrous priests, because the Syrians were idolaters" Not only shall the persons of these priests be cut off, but their very name and memory shall vanish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the priests</span> (<span class="accented">kohanim</span>). Together with the legitimate priests who had corrupted the worship of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-4.htm">Zephaniah 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That worship the host of heaven upon the house tops.</span> In this verse two classes of fame worshippers are mentioned, viz. star worshippers, and waverers. The worship of the sun, moon, and stars was a very ancient form of error, the heavenly bodies being regarded as the representatives of the powers of nature and the originators of events on earth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>). It was especially prevalent in the time of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), On the flat roofs of the houses, which were used as places of meditation, recreation, or conference (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>), they erected altars for family worship of the heavenly bodies. Here they both burned incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>) and offered animal sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>). "In Syrian cities," says Dr. Thomson, "the roofs are a great comfort. The ordinary houses have no other place where the inmates, can either see the sun, smell the air, dry their clothes, set out their flower pots, or do numberless other things essential to their health and comfort. During a large part of the year the roof is the most agreeable place about the establishment, especially in the morning and evening. There multitudes sleep during the summer" ('The Land and the Book,' p. 39). <span class="cmt_word">Them that worship and that,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">the worshippers who</span>, etc. These were people who endeavoured to blend the worship of God with that of Baal, or halted between two opinions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Swear by the Lord;</span> rather, swear to the <span class="accented">Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bind themselves by oath to him, and at the same time <span class="cmt_word">swear by Malcham;</span> <span class="accented">swear by their king</span>, Baal, or Moloch; call upon him as god. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "by their king." But it is, perhaps, best to retain the name untranslated, in which ease it would be the appellation of the god Moloch, who could hardly be omitted in enumerating the objects of idolatrous worship (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>; and notes on Amos 1:15; 5:26). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-6 Ruin is coming, utter ruin; destruction from the Almighty. The servants of God all proclaim, There is no peace for the wicked. The expressions are figurative, speaking every where desolation; the land shall be left without inhabitants. The sinners to be consumed are, the professed idolaters, and those that worship Jehovah and idols, or swear to the Lord, and to Malcham. Those that think to divide their affections and worship between God and idols, will come short of acceptance with God; for what communion can there be between light and darkness? If Satan have half, he will have all; if the Lord have but half, he will have none. Neglect of God shows impiety and contempt. May none of us be among those who draw back unto perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.</body></html>
