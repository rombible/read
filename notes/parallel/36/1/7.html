<span class="accented">silete a facie Domini Dei</span> (Vulgate). The expression is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>. The reason of this silent awe is next given. <span class="cmt_word">For the day of the Lord is at hand.</span> The day of judgment is thus called (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath prepared a sacrifice.</span> The words are from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17, 19</a>). The sacrifice is the guilty Jewish nation. The punishment of the wicked is regarded as a satisfaction offered to the Divine justice. <span class="cmt_word">He hath bid his guests;</span> <span class="accented">he hath consecrated his called</span>. The "called ones" are the strange nations whom God summons to execute his vengeance. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. These are said to be "sanctified," as if engaged in a holy war, when summoned to punish those who had become as heathen. So those who are called to chastise Babylon are termed "my sanctified ones" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>), as being the instruments appointed and set apart to carry out this purpose (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>). The particular agents intended are not specified by the prophet, whose mission was not directed to any such definition. He has to speak generally of the judgment to come, not of those whom God should employ to inflict it. We know from other sources that the Chaldeans are meant, they or the Assyrians being always announced as the executors of God's vengeance on his rebellions people. The notion, adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and others, that the prophet refers to some supposed invasion of Scythians which took place about this time, would never have been started had not such authors desired to eliminate the predictive element from prophetic utterances. The vague account of Herod., 1:105 gives no support to the assertion that the Scythians invaded Palestine in Josiah's reign; nor is there a trace of any knowledge of such irruption in Zephaniah or Jeremiah (see Introduction, &sect; I.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-13 God's day is at hand; the punishment of presumptuous sinners is a sacrifice to the justice of God. The Jewish royal family shall be reckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on the threshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing their possessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called to account. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secure and easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards and punishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearly appear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice for breaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice.</body></html>
