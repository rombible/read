Bloodshed is as little regarded as dust that is trodden under foot (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a>). The comparison with water is found elsewhere (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-3.htm">Psalm 79:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their flesh as the dung.</span> The verb from the preceding clause may be taken by zeuguna with this clause; then the meaning is that their dead bodies are left unburied to rot on the ground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-22.htm">Jeremiah 9:22</a>). Or the substantive verb may be supplied (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-7.htm">Job 20:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:14-18 This warning of approaching destruction, is enough to make the sinners in Zion tremble; it refers to the great day of the Lord, the day in which he will show himself by taking vengeance on them. This day of the Lord is very near; it is a day of God's wrath, wrath to the utmost. It will be a day of trouble and distress to sinners. Let them not be laid asleep by the patience of God. What is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? And what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Let us flee from the wrath to come, and choose the good part that shall never be taken from us; then we shall be prepared for every event; nothing shall separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</body></html>
