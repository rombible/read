The royal family, not specially the sons of Josiah, who, if they were then in existence, must have been mere children, but princes of the royal house. The reference may be particularly to the sons of the king reigning when the judgment fell (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). The king himself is not mentioned as subject to the judgment, inasmuch as he was pious and obedient (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27</a>, etc.). In the mention of these "children" Keil finds proof of the late origin of the prophecy. Such as are clothed with strange apparel. This clause must represent the sin for which the princes are "visited." "Strange" apparel means "foreign" apparel, and this implied foreign manners and habits. The Israelites were reminded by their very dress that they were a peculiar people, consecrated to God's service (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-37.htm">Numbers 15:37</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>). These nobles, however, assumed the dress of the Egyptians and other nations with which they came in contact, and, despising their own national customs, copied the manners and vices of foreigners (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>; 1 Macc. 1:11-15). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-13 God's day is at hand; the punishment of presumptuous sinners is a sacrifice to the justice of God. The Jewish royal family shall be reckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on the threshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing their possessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called to account. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secure and easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards and punishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearly appear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice for breaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice.</body></html>
