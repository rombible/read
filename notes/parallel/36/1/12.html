No evil doer shall escape. The enemy whom God summons to execute his wrath shall leave no corner unsearched where the debauchees hide themselves (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-8.htm">Luke 15:8</a>). Jerome and commentators after him refer to Josephus's account of the last siege of Jerusalem for a parallel to these predicted proceedings of the Chaldeans. Here we read how princes and priests and chieftains were dragged from sewers, and pits, and caves, and tombs, where they had hidden themselves in fear of death, and were mercilessly slain wherever they were found (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:09). <span class="cmt_word">The men that are settled on their lees;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> confirmed, hardened, and inveterate in their evil habits. The metaphor is derived from old wine not racked off; which retains all its flavour and odour, and becomes thick and viscid (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>).

These "fools" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>) deny God's moral government of the world; they will not see the working of Divine providence in all that happens, but, secure and careless in their worldly prosperity, they assign all events to chance or natural law, placing Jehovah in the same category as the idols worshipped by heathens (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>, etc.; Psalms 94:7). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-13 God's day is at hand; the punishment of presumptuous sinners is a sacrifice to the justice of God. The Jewish royal family shall be reckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on the threshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing their possessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called to account. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secure and easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards and punishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearly appear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice for breaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice.</body></html>
