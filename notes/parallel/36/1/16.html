Among the Jews trumpets were used to announce the festivals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1</a>), and to give the signal for battle or of the approach of an enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-4.htm">Ezekiel 33:4</a>). Here it is the signal of destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The fenced cities.</span> The strongest fortresses shall feel the irresistible attack (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The high towers.</span> These are the turrets built at the angles of the walls for the better defence of the city, and to annoy the besiegers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>). LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, "upon the lofty angles;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">super angulos excelsos.</span> Others take the words to mean "the battlements" on the walls. Henderson quotes Taeitus's description of the later walls of Jerusalem, "Duos colles immensum editos claudebant muri per artem obliqui aut introrsus sinuati, ut latera oppugnantium ad ictus patescerent" ('Hist.,' 5:11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:14-18 This warning of approaching destruction, is enough to make the sinners in Zion tremble; it refers to the great day of the Lord, the day in which he will show himself by taking vengeance on them. This day of the Lord is very near; it is a day of God's wrath, wrath to the utmost. It will be a day of trouble and distress to sinners. Let them not be laid asleep by the patience of God. What is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? And what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Let us flee from the wrath to come, and choose the good part that shall never be taken from us; then we shall be prepared for every event; nothing shall separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</body></html>
