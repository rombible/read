The denunciation extends to all Philistia. <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of the sea coast.</span> Both the. Greek and Latin Versions retain the notion of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">chebel:</span> "Ye who inhabit the measured allotment of the sea." "Philistia," says Sir C. Warren, "consists of an undulating plain from fifty to a hundred feet above the level of the sea, reaching thirty-two miles from Ekron to Gaza, with a breadth of from nine to sixteen miles. To the east of this the hills commence, not the hill country, but a series of low spurs and undulating ground, culminating in hogs' backs, running nearly north and south, and rising in places to twelve hundred feet above the ocean" ('Survey Memoirs: Jerusalem,' p. 436). <span class="cmt_word">The nation of the Cherethites.</span> So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>. Zephaniah calls the Philistines by this name for the sake of a play on the word, <span class="accented">Cherethites</span> meaning "Cutters off," and they were devoted to being "cut off" (<span class="accented">karath</span>). Part of David's bodyguard was composed of the same people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). The name seems to have belonged to a portion of the Philistines who inhabited the southern part of the district. "One of the principal villages of Philistia is now called <span class="accented">Keretiya</span>, so that the term may apply to the inhabitants of this town - an ancient Cherith not mentioned in the Bible" (Courier's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 237). They have been supposed to have emigrated from Crete, but there are no reliable grounds for this theory, though the LXX. in the present passage has, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "sojourners of the Cretans;' and the Syriac gives a similar rendering. St. Jerome renders, "gens perditorum," "nation of destroyers." <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord is against you.</span> The sentence is pronounced in the words following. <span class="cmt_word">O Canaan.</span> O Philistia, which shall be as Canaan, and in like manner exterminated. Canaan means "Lowland," a name which originally was applied to the Phoenician and Philistine tracts on the seacoast. <span class="cmt_word">I will even destroy thee.</span> The like threat is uttered by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4, 5</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15-17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:4-15 Those are really in a woful condition who have the word of the Lord against them, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. God will restore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It has been the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached and reviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and the strangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must be reckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings of the insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented. But all the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for the overturning Satan's kingdom. Let us improve our advantages, and expect the performance of every promise, praying that our Father's name may be hallowed every where, over all the earth.</body></html>
