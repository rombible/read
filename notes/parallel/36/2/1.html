EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE AND TO PERSEVERANCE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - &sect; 1. <span class="accented">The prophet urges all to examine their ways before the day of the Lord come</span>; <span class="accented">and he prays the righteous to seek the Lord more earnestly, in order that they may be safe in the judgment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gather yourselves together</span>. So the versions; and this rendering is probably correct. The prophet calls upon his nation to assemble themselves together in order to take mutual counsel or to make general confession and supplication to God. Another rendering, based on some alteration of letters, is, "Set yourselves to be ashamed; yea, be ashamed" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-8.htm">Isaiah 46:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, gather together.</span> The LXX. renders the two words, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "be ye gathered and bound together;" "Id est," says Jerome, "estote vobis caritatis vinculo copulati." <span class="cmt_word">O nation not desired;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">gens non amabilis</span> - a litotes for abominable, hated for its sins, unworthy of God's love and care. The Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "unchastened," points to the meaning affixed by the Chaldee paraphrase, that does not wish to be converted," having no desire for amendment; like what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>, "they received no correction." Others render, "which does not turn pale," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which is not ashamed, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>. The verb <span class="accented">kasaph</span> seems to have this meaning in niphal, according to Talmudic use; but its usual signification is "to pine" or "long for." The Revised Version gives in the margin, "that hath no longing" - a rendering adopted by Professor Gandell, implying that the people are quite satisfied with their present condition, and have no aspiration for anything better or higher (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>). This is a very apposite interpretation; but there is no sufficient ground for rejecting the translation of the Authorized Version, which is supported by high authority, is agreeable to the use of the word, and affords a satisfactory sense. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-3 The prophet calls to national repentance, as the only way to prevent national ruin. A nation not desiring, that has not desires toward God, is not desirous of his favour and grace, has no mind to repent and reform. Or, not desirable, not having any thing to recommend them to God; to whom God might justly say, Depart from me; but he says, Gather together to me that you may seek my face. We know what God's decree will bring against impenitent sinners, therefore it highly concerns all to repent in the accepted time. How careful should we all be to seek peace with God, before the Holy Spirit withdraws from us, or ceases to strive with us; before the day of grace is over, or the day of life; before our everlasting state is determined! Let the poor, despised, and afflicted, seek the Lord, and seek to understand and keep his commandments better, that they may be more humbled for their sins. The chief hope of deliverance from national judgments rests upon prayer.</body></html>
