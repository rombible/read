The Divine purpose is represented as a woman labouring with child, travailing before it comes to execution. This is thrice repeated in substance, to show the certainty and speed of its arrival. <span class="cmt_word">Before the day pass as the chaff.</span> "Before" is not in the Hebrew, and the clause is parenthetical, "Like chaff the day passeth." "The day" must be still the day of the Lord, not the day of life or the day of repentance. God brings on the judgment as easily and as quickly as the wind carries the chaff before it. The Septuagint and Syriac join the two clauses together; thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Before ye become as a flower that passeth away." And Jerome gives, "Priusquam pariat jussio quasi pulverem transeuntem diem," "Before the decree beget the day which passeth by like the dust." The present Hebrew text does not confirm these versions. The figure of the chaff is common (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-3 The prophet calls to national repentance, as the only way to prevent national ruin. A nation not desiring, that has not desires toward God, is not desirous of his favour and grace, has no mind to repent and reform. Or, not desirable, not having any thing to recommend them to God; to whom God might justly say, Depart from me; but he says, Gather together to me that you may seek my face. We know what God's decree will bring against impenitent sinners, therefore it highly concerns all to repent in the accepted time. How careful should we all be to seek peace with God, before the Holy Spirit withdraws from us, or ceases to strive with us; before the day of grace is over, or the day of life; before our everlasting state is determined! Let the poor, despised, and afflicted, seek the Lord, and seek to understand and keep his commandments better, that they may be more humbled for their sins. The chief hope of deliverance from national judgments rests upon prayer.</body></html>
