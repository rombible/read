<span class="accented">herds.</span> The prophet describes graphically the desolation mentioned in the preceding verse. The "herds" are not sheep and cattle, as in parallel cases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-10.htm">Isaiah 27:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), but all <span class="cmt_word">the beasts of the nations</span> - all the wild beasts that infest the country. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The Hebrew will hardly hear Keil's rendering, "all kinds of beasts in crowds." (Compare similar predictions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The cormorant</span> (<span class="accented">kaath</span>); probably <span class="accented">the pelican</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">onocrotalus</span>; the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, which word Schleusner thinks to have been interchanged with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> that follows soon afterwards. Bat in the latter place Jerome has <span class="accented">corvus.</span> The pelican is found in the Assyrian monuments tinder more than one appellation (see 'Transact. of See. of Bibl. Archaeol.,' 8:93, etc., and 141). <span class="cmt_word">The bittern</span> (<span class="accented">kippod</span>). Most recent critics translate this by "hedgehog" or "porcupine." The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ericius.</span> But neither hedgehog nor porcupine utters cries or frequents pools of water, and it may well be doubted whether some marsh-loving bird is not meant. Certainly the following clause suits the habits of a bird better than those of a hedgehog (see 'Bible Educator,' 3:312, where Dr. Tristram is quoted saying, "As a matter of fact, the bittern is very abundant in these swamps of the Tigris, and in all the marshy grounds of Syria; and its strange booming note, disturbing the stillness of the night, gives an idea of desolation which nothing but the wail of the hyena can equal"). No notice of the bittern seems to be found in the Assyrian monuments, though the mention of the heron is not uncommon. The <span class="accented">kaath</span> and <span class="accented">kippod</span> are commonly mentioned together, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>. II. <span class="cmt_word">The upper lintels;</span> "the capitals" of the columns (see note on Amos 9:1, where the same word <span class="accented">kaphtor</span> is used). <span class="cmt_word">Their voice shall sing in the windows;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the voice of the songster in the window.</span> Birds shall perch and sing in the apertures of the ruined palaces. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vox cantantis in fenestra</span>; the LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "Wild beasts shall cry in the breaches thereof." Others translate, "Hark! it singeth in the windows." There are no traces of windows in any of the Assyrian palaces, even in the case of chambers next the outer walls. If daylight were admitted, it must have entered through openings in the ceilings (Layard, 'Nineveh.' 2:260). Desolation shall be in the thresholds. The word rendered "desolation" (<span class="accented">chorebh</span>) Jerome notes may be read as meaning "sword," "drought." and "raven;" he adopts the last signification, and translates, in agreement with the LXX., <span class="accented">corvus.</span> But it seems best to take the term as signifying "desolation;" no human creature shall be found there, only ruin and rubbish. Ewald renders, "Owls shall sing in the windows, crows on the threshold, 'shivered. crushed.'" For he shall uncover (<span class="accented">he hath laid bare</span>) the cedar work. God, or the enemy, has so destroyed the palaces that the cedar panelling is exposed to the weather. Jerome has, "Attenuabo robur ejus." We see by Sennacherib's boast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>) that the Assyrians imported cedars for building purposes. And we have monumental evidence of the employment of cedar in palaces at least since the time of Assurnazirpal, <span class="date">B.C. 860</span>. Esar-haddon reports that he received cypress and cedar from Lebanon as tribute; and Assurbanipal states that in erecting his palace he used cedar pillars from Sirjon and Lebanon (Schrader, 'Die Keilinschrift. und Alt. Test.,' pp. 183, 453). Neriglissar, King of Babylon, <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>, in rebuilding his palace, records that he "arranged tall cedars for its roof" ('Records of the Past,' 5:142). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:4-15 Those are really in a woful condition who have the word of the Lord against them, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. God will restore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It has been the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached and reviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and the strangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must be reckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings of the insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented. But all the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for the overturning Satan's kingdom. Let us improve our advantages, and expect the performance of every promise, praying that our Father's name may be hallowed every where, over all the earth.</body></html>
