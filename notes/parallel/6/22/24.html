Had the Hebrew original intended to convey this meaning, we should have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> The literal rendering is, "from anxiety, from a word." The word here translated "anxiety" (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is applied to the sea, and is translated "sorrow" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>. It is translated "heaviness" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18, 19</a>, it is translated "care," "carefulness," and is applied to eating food. It obviously refers to agitation or anxiety of mind, and the proper translation here is, "we did it out of anxiety, for a cause." So Masius and Rosenmuller, who render the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> here by <span class="accented">sollicitudo.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What have you to do with the Lord God of Israel? For the Lord hath made Jordan a border.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">What to you and to Jehovah the God of Israel, since He hath given a border between us and between you, sons of Reuben and sons of Gad, even the Jordan.</span> Thus the reason for the erection of the altar was the very converse of what it had been supposed to be. So far from considering themselves as shut out from the communion of Israel by the natural boundary formed by Jordan, the two and a half tribes were resolved that no one else should ever think so. If the descendants of the remainder of the Israelites should ever venture to assert anything of the kind, there was the altar, erected in a conspicuous position on the west side of Jordan, left as a perpetual memorial of the great struggle in which Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh had taken part, and which had resulted in the final occupation of the land of Canaan. Keil and Delitzsch remark that there was some reason for this anxiety. The promises made to Abraham and his posterity related only to the land of Canaan. For their own advantage these tribes had chosen to remain in the trans-Jordanic territory conquered by Moses. It was quite possible that in future ages they might be regarded as outside the blessings and privileges of the Mosaic covenant. For the present, at least, they value those blessings and privileges, and desired to have some permanent memorial of the fact that they had a right to share them. <span class="cmt_word">From fearing.</span> It may be worth while to notice, as a sign of later, or at least of different authorship, that the Pentateuch employs a different (the feminine) form of the infinitive for the form found here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:21-29 The tribes took the reproofs of their brethren in good part. With solemnity and meekness they proceeded to give all the satisfaction in their power. Reverence of God is expressed in the form of their appeal. This brief confession of faith would remove their brethren's suspicion that they intended to worship other gods. Let us always speak of God with seriousness, and mention his name with a solemn pause. Those who make appeals to Heaven with a careless God knows, take his name in vain: it is very unlike this. They express great confidence of their own uprightness in the matter of their appeal. God knows it, for he is perfectly acquainted with the thoughts and intents of the heart. In every thing we do in religion, it highly concerns us to approve ourselves to God, remembering that he knows the heart. And if our sincerity be known to God, we should study likewise to let others know it by its fruits, especially those who, though they mistake us, show zeal for the glory of God. They disdained the design of which they were suspected to be guilty, and fully explained their true intent in building this altar. Those who have found the comfort and benefit of God's ordinances, cannot but desire to preserve them to their seed, and to use all possible care that their children may be looked upon as having a part in him. Christ is the great Altar that sanctifies every gift; the best evidence of our interest in him is the work of his Spirit in our hearts.</body></html>
