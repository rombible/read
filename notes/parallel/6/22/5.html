<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-13.htm">Joshua 11:13, 22</a>; 30:6, 16, 20, etc.) The expressions, as Keil well remarks, are "crowded together, so that obedience to God's commands may be the more deeply impressed on their hearts." It is worthy of remark, that while beginning with the love of God, Joshua does not end there. The best proof of love is our conduct towards the person loved. If love be genuine, it is the practical principle which produces diligent service, punctual obedience, faithful attachment, the devotion of the heart and soul. <span class="cmt_word">Commandment and law.</span> The first of these words, derived from a root signifying to <span class="accented">set up</span>, has rather the force of what we call a <span class="accented">positive</span> precept, referring to single acts. The word translated <span class="accented">law</span>, derived from the root to <span class="accented">cast</span>, hence to stretch out the hand, to point out, refers rather to <span class="accented">moral</span> precepts. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and our <span class="accented">law</span> are used in the same sense. <span class="cmt_word">Cleave unto Him.</span> The Hebrew is stronger, cleave <span class="accented">into</span> Him, as though regarding not so much isolated actions as principles of life. Our life was to be "rooted and grounded," to use an apostolic phrase, in His. But the full significance of these words could not be understood till One had come who enabled us by faith to "eat His flesh and drink His blood," and so be united to Him as the branch to its root. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-9 Joshua dismisses the tribes with good counsel. Those who have the commandment have it in vain, unless they do the commandment; and it will not be done aright unless we take diligent heed. In particular to love the Lord our God, as the best of beings, and the best of friends; and as far as that principle rules in the heart, there will be constant care and endeavour to walk in his ways, even those that are narrow and up-hill. In every instance to keep his commandments. At all times, and in all conditions, with purpose of heart to cleave unto the Lord, and to serve him and his kingdom among men, with all our heart, and with all our soul. This good counsel is given to all; may God give us grace to take it!</body></html>
