but it is a witness between us and you.">Joshua 22:28</a>, it was a representation of the altar of Jehovah: a copy of the one altar which He had given to Israel for sacrifice. The design was to set up on the east of Jordan a likeness of that altar which was established on the west, that the tribes on the other side of Jordan might appeal to it as a proof that they also were the people of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Half tribe of Manasseh.</span> Throughout this part of the narrative, when the body politic, rather than the descent of the tribe, is to be indicated, we have, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>. See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29</a>. <span class="cmt_word">An altar.</span> The original has the altar. <span class="cmt_word">Over against</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>. It is difficult to fix the meaning of this expression. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> seems to have meant <span class="accented">the front</span> of anything, and therefore <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> would naturally mean <span class="accented">towards</span> the front of, or <span class="accented">in</span> front cf. Thus we have had the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a> (where see note), where it seems to mean, <span class="accented">in the direction of</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1</a>, where it seems to have the same meaning. With verbs of motion it signifies <span class="accented">towards</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-30.htm">1 Samuel 17:30</a>. Here it clearly cannot be pressed to mean <span class="accented">across</span> Jordan. See note below. <span class="cmt_word">The borders of Jordan.</span> As above, ver. 10, the <span class="accented">circles</span> of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">At the passage of the children of Israel.</span> The word translated "the passage of," literally," unto over," has originally the sense of "across." Here, however, it means "<span class="accented">towards</span> <span class="accented">the region opposite to the sons of Israel," i.e., in the direction of</span> the country on the other side Jordan. The country across Jordan was usually designated as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> Jordan. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, the phrase used here, we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-26.htm">Exodus 28:26</a>, apparently in the sense of <span class="accented">across</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-19.htm">Exodus 39:19</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-13.htm">Deuteronomy 30:13</a> it is used of moving in the direction of a place, "across" or "over the sea." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9, 12</a>, with the addition of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, the phrase means "straight forward." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-40.htm">1 Samuel 14:40</a> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> means "on one side." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> means "over." Thus the altar was not necessarily on the other side Jordan. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:10-20 Here is the care of the separated tribes to keep their hold of Canaan's religion. At first sight it seemed a design to set up an altar against the altar at Shiloh. God is jealous for his own institutions; we should be so too, and afraid of every thing that looks like, or leads to idolatry. Corruptions in religion are best dealt with at first. But their prudence in following up this zealous resolution is no less commendable. Many an unhappy strife would be prevented, or soon made up, by inquiries into the matter of the offence. The remembrance of great sins committed formerly, should engage us to stand on our guard against the beginnings of sin; for the way of sin is down-hill. We are all concerned to reprove our neighbour when he does amiss, lest we suffer sin upon him, Le 19:17. The offer made that they should be welcome to come to the land where the Lord's tabernacle was, and settle there, was in the spirit of true Israelites.</body></html>
