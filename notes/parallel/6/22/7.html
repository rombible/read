We cannot fail to observe that both in ancient times, and also among ourselves, the conduct of the two and a half tribes in choosing their inheritance on the east of Jordan has been regarded as laying them open to some blame. Historically, this is incorrect. God delivered the land of Sihon and Og to Israel; some one must inherit it. Again, the true eastern boundary of Palestine is not the Jordan, but the mountain range of Gilead, which parts it from the desert that lies beyond. Really the two and a half tribes were as much in Palestine as the rest, only their position does not take advantage of that wonderful miracle by which Jordan was driven back, and the Israelites were enabled to strike at the heart of their Canaanitish foes. They themselves, however, were compelled to cross the Jordan before they could obtain the <span class= "ital">nest </span>which they seemed to have won before they crossed it--"that they without us should not be made perfect." In the spiritual world these two and a half tribes answer to the people who received their inheritance from Moses (i.e., from the law); the others are those who received nothing until they followed Joshua, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Captain of salvation, Jesus Christ, who gives rest to <span class= "ital">all. </span>When He came, His own people were divided, like the tribe of Manasseh. Some could not forsake Moses, a sacrifice which they thought He required of them; some gave up all, and followed Him. "Forgetting (Heb., <span class= "ital">M</span>'<span class= "ital">nasheh</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Manasseh) the things that were behind, and reaching forth unto the things before," they would take nothing but what He gave. These are they who receive special blessing from Him. (See <span class= "ital">Names on the Gates of Pearl</span>--Manasseh, p. 165, &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh.</span> We have here, as Keil remarks, a specimen of our author's habit of repetition. Four times do we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-3.htm">Joshua 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-7.htm">Joshua 18:7</a>) that the Levites were to have no share in the division of the land. Four times (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-3.htm">Joshua 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-7.htm">Joshua 18:7</a>, and here) does he repeat that the tribe of Manasseh was divided into two, and had its inheritance on either side Jordan. The same kind of repetition occurs in the narrative of the passing of the Jordan. It has been before remarked to be a characteristic of the style of the Old Testament generally, but nowhere is it found to a greater degree than in the Book of Joshua. Yet this, to which critics of the analytical school have objected as a sign of spuriousness, is in fact one of those peculiarities of style which mark the individuality of the writer. It is to inspired history what the Gospel and Epistles of St. John are to inspired theology. The form belongs to the author; the matter, at least as regards its general purport, belongs to God. A Hebrew writer, we are reminded in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' does not quote or refer to what has been already stated. If it is necessary to make his narrative clear, he repeats it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-9 Joshua dismisses the tribes with good counsel. Those who have the commandment have it in vain, unless they do the commandment; and it will not be done aright unless we take diligent heed. In particular to love the Lord our God, as the best of beings, and the best of friends; and as far as that principle rules in the heart, there will be constant care and endeavour to walk in his ways, even those that are narrow and up-hill. In every instance to keep his commandments. At all times, and in all conditions, with purpose of heart to cleave unto the Lord, and to serve him and his kingdom among men, with all our heart, and with all our soul. This good counsel is given to all; may God give us grace to take it!</body></html>
