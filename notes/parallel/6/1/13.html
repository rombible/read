Those who condemn the two and a half tribes (or the persons whom they suppose to be spiritually represented by them) for not going far enough, should notice that on both sides of Jordan equally there was the "rest of God." But this "rest" is only the first stage of several in Israel's history.

"These all received not the promise." <span class= "ital">"There remaineth </span>therefore <span class= "ital">a rest </span>to the people of God."
