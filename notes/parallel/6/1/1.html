Moses' minister.</span>--Joshua's commission was the first of its kind, but not the last. No man before Joshua had received orders to regulate his conduct by the words of a written book. Abraham and his household had kept God's laws. Moses had acted by Divine commission. But Abraham and Moses received their orders from the mouth of Jehovah. Joshua and all his successors must fulfil the orders of "this book of the law." Thus Joshua was Moses' <span class= "ital">minister </span>in more than one sense. He was Moses' confidential agent and personal attendant while he lived, and afterwards the executor of that which Moses had written. But the position of Joshua, though at first unique and without precedent, was the position designed for all his successors, more especially for that great Personage whose name Joshua was the first to bear. Joshua and the Book of the Law come before us together, without introduction, in the same passage of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm" title="And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.">Exodus 17:9</a>), "Moses said <span class= "ital">unto Joshua, </span>Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-14.htm" title="Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but you shall pass before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;">Joshua 1:14</a>, "Write this for a memorial <span class= "ital">in a book, </span>and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua." The book was prepared for Joshua; Joshua came to fulfil the words of the book. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7</a>, "Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God." "Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm" title="Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:">Romans 15:8</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p>For the use of the word <span class= "ital">"</span>minister" (Heb., <span class= "ital">m'shareth</span>) compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-43.htm" title="And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?

The question forces itself upon the critic, At what time was this consecutive narrative written, as is admitted, in various styles, in the language of obviously distinct periods - first composed and palmed off upon the Jews as the genuine work of a writer contemporary, or nearly contemporary, with the events he describes? <span class="cmt_word">The servant of the Lord.</span> This term (Keil) is applied to the heavens and the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a>), to the angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>), to the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>, etc.), to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to the Jewish people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>), to Zerubbabel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>), and even to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, etc.), as the appointed minister of God's wrath, and to pious men in general (Gesenius; see Psalm 34:23, etc.). It is also applied to the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; comp. the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> similarly applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>). It originally implies the position of a <span class="accented">slave</span>, whether born in the house or bought with money (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3, 14</a>). In all cases it expresses a closer and more familiar relation than the term <span class="accented">minister</span> below. Keil says that it is applied so frequently to Moses that it has become almost his "official title" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>, and the Book of Joshua <span class="accented">passim</span>, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>). It is, however, still more frequently applied to David. But it suits well with the special and peculiar mission which Moses had above the rest of mankind. He was, as it were, the household servant of the Most High, His steward and representative, ruling over the family of God in His name, and giving to them the directions of which they stood in need. <span class="cmt_word">That the Lord spake unto Joshua.</span> Either by <span class="accented">Urim and Thummin</span>, which seems at least probable (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>). But the great majority of commentators prefer the idea of an inward revelation, since the words are frequently used in this Book of God's revelations to Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>, etc.). The manner of these inward revelations is also a matter on which much difference of opinion exists. They, no doubt, were frequently made through a vision or dream, as to Abraham at Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>), Jacob at Bethel, and Joshua him. self (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>). But it is by no means clear that they were <span class="accented">always</span> so. The voice of God in answer to prayer is recognised by Christians in a strong inward persuasion of the desirability or necessity of a particular course. Of this kind would seem to be the answer to St. Paul's prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>. And it is quite possible that in passages such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, 22:1, 2, nothing more is meant than that the persuasion, by God's permission or inspiration, was strongly felt within. And so it is possible that one so specially and divinely commissioned as Joshua discerned in a strong and apparently irresistible conviction, the voice of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>). <span class="accented">Joshua's</span> name was originally <span class="accented">Hoshea</span> (like the prophet and the Israelitish king of that name). The name originally meant <span class="accented">salvation</span>, or <span class="accented">deliverance</span>, but it was changed, either when he entered into Moses' service, or when he was about to fight the Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-44.htm">Deuteronomy 32:44</a>), into Jehoshua, or Joshua (either "God shall save," or "God's salvation"). It is not stated in Holy Writ <span class="accented">when</span> the name Joshua was given. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a>, where Joshua is named for the first time, he is called by the name Moses gave him, and is mentioned incidentally as a person well known to the writer and his readers. The reader need hardly be reminded that in the form Jeshua (Gr. <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) it was the name of our Blessed Lord Himself, and that the Name which is now above all other names is used of Joshua in two places in the New Testament, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>. It was a common name in later times, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-11.htm">Colossians 4:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a> will serve to show. In later Hebrew, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>, Joshua is called Jeshua, and the names of Joshua and Jeshua are given indiscriminately to the high priest, the son of Josedeeh, who was contemporary with the building of the second temple. For Joshua as a type of Christ the reader may consult a deep passage in 'Pearson on the Creed,' Art. II., from which some of the most striking parts are here quoted: - "First, it was he alone, of all which passed out of Egypt, who was designed to lead the children of Israel into Canaan, which land, as it is a type of heaven, so is the person which brought the Israelites into that place of rest a type of Him who only can bring us into the presence of God, and there prepare our mansions for us. Besides, it is further observable, not only what Joshua did, but what Moses could not do. The hand of Moses and Aaron brought them out of Egypt, but left them in the wilderness. Joshua, the successor, only could effect that in which Moses failed. Moses must die that Joshua may succeed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20-22</a>). The command of circumcision was not given to Moses, but to Joshua; nor were the Israelites circumcised in the wilderness under the conduct of Moses and Aaron, but in the land of Canaan under their successor. Which speaketh Jesus to be the true circumciser, the author of another circumcision than that of the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>). If we look on Joshua as the 'minister of Moses,' he is even in that a type of Christ, 'the minister of the circumcision for the truth of God.' If we look on him as the successor of Moses, in that he represented Jesus, inasmuch as 'the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.' If we look on him as judge and ruler of Israel, there is scarce an action which is not predictive of our Saviour. He begins his office at the banks of Jordan, where Christ was baptized and enters upon the public exercise of His prophetical office; he chooseth there twelve men out of the people to carry twelve stones over with them, as our Jesus thence began to choose His twelve apostles, those foundation stones in the Church of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>). Joshua smote the Amalekites and subdued the Canaanites, By the first making way to enter the land, by the second giving possession of it. And Jesus in like manner goeth in and out before us against our spiritual enemies, subduing sin and Satan, and so opening and clearing our way to heaven; destroying the last enemy, death, and so giving us possession of eternal life." Pearson quotes Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Theodoret, and others as justifying his view of the history. Theodoret, moreover, in his 'Questions on Joshua,' remarks on the coincidence between <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-17.htm">Joshua 1:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-46.htm">John 5:46</a>. And Origen, in his first 'Homily on Joshua,' remarks on the fact that the first time the sacred name meets us in the Book of God, it is as the leader of an army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a>). Another way in which Joshua was a type of Christ is this. Under Moses there are constant murmurings and disputings, for "the law made nothing perfect" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a>). Under Joshua all is confidence and triumph, for "by one offering Jesus hath perfected forever them that are sanctified" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Moses' minister.</span> This word is principally used of service in the house of God. Thus it is used of Aaron and his sons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm">Exodus 39:41</a>, etc.: of Samuel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-11.htm">1 Samuel 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>, etc.: of the priests and Levites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-32.htm">1 Chronicles 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm">Ezekiel 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>, etc. In these places it seems to be equivalent to the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. But it is by no means confined to such service. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is applied to Joshua, it is rendered in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and it is quite clear that Joshua's service to Moses was not exclusively of a religious character. Some commentators have suggested the word <span class="accented">aide de camp</span>, but this would be equally incorrect in the opposite direction, since Joshua's services (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>) were clearly not rendered only in time of war. The word is used of Abishag the Shunamite, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm">1 Kings 1:4, 15</a>; and of Elisha, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-21.htm">1 Kings 19:21</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Joshua had attended upon Moses. He who was called to honour, had been long used to business. Our Lord Jesus took upon him the form of a servant. Joshua was trained up under command. Those are fittest to rule, who have learned to obey. The removal of useful men should quicken survivors to be the more diligent in doing good. Arise, go over Jordan. At this place and at this time the banks were overflowed. Joshua had no bridge or boats, and yet he must believe that God, having ordered the people over, would open a way.</body></html>
