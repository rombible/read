But it does not seem possible to assign any other meaning to the word except that of provision for a journey or for a warlike expedition. Perhaps the order was intended to prepare the Israelites for the transition from the manna to other food. It may be also that the manna which supported them in their pilgrimage through the wilderness was not so fit to sustain them in the warfare which they were about to begin. For the phrase itself, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-39.htm" title="And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.">Exodus 12:39</a> : "They were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither <span class= "ital">had they prepared for themselves any victual." </span>When there was a difficulty in obtaining other provision, God gave His people manna. Now, when they could easily provide food for themselves, He would not support them in idleness; and perhaps this is the common-sense view of the order given in the text. If called to any expedition which would take them far from the camp, the manna would not be within reach of all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepare you victuals.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">game</span>, the term being applied to meat obtained by hunting. Thus it is applied by Isaac to Esau's venison in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>. Here it means <span class="accented">food of any kind</span>, but especially animal food. It is therefore obvious that the miraculous supply of manna was soon to cease (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Within three days.</span> Much difficulty has been created here by the fact that another three days are mentioned in chap. 3:2 as elapsing after the return of the spies, which has been supposed to have taken place between this command and the period then mentioned. Three more days were spent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-22.htm">Joshua 2:22</a>) by the spies in eluding the pursuit of the men of Jericho - one day in going thither, and one more in returning to Moses. Consequently eight days, if not more (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>), must have elapsed between this proclamation and the actual crossing of the Jordan. But when we remember that the Hebrew language possesses no pluperfect tense, that there are many instances, such as (very probably) <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, and more certainly <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18, 32</a>, where the Hebrew narrative has clearly departed from the chronological order, and that the chronology is obscured by this chasm in the Hebrew linguistic system, we may suppose that the narrative in the second chapter is parenthetical, and relates to events which occurred before the occasion now spoken cf. This is the view taken by Josephus and the Rabbis, and our translators have adopted it in the margin - a proceeding which, as their preface shows, may frequently be held to imply that in their opinion it is the preferable interpretation. It is energetically impugned by Keil, who maintains that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of this arrangement. He does not, however, make out a very powerful case against the simple explanation of Cornelius a Lapide, that the spies left the camp on the 3rd Nisan, returned on the 6th, that Joshua gave his order on the 7th, and that on the 10th (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>) the crossing was effected. Stripped of all verbiage, Keil's argument appears to amount simply to this, that it was not likely that the account of the narrative would be thus interrupted by an account of a transaction out of its proper chronological order. It may be added that it seems doubtful whether we must not render the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> in ver. 12, by the pluperfect, for it seems very probable that the word of command to the two tribes and a half who had obtained their inheritance beyond Jordan had been given before this, and that therefore it may have preceded the command given to the spies, in which case one of Keil's chief objections fails to the ground. Other explanations than that of Cornelius a Lapide have been suggested. Thus Kimchi supposes that the spies left on the 5th Nisan and returned on the 8th; while Masius supposes that they were sent out simultaneously with these orders. Augustine's explanation, that Joshua did not speak by revelation, but was influenced by human hope, is noticeable, as proving that the early fathers did not always take the strictest view of inspiration. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Joshua says to the people, Ye shall pass over Jordan, and shall possess the land; because God had said so to him. We honour the truth of God, when we stagger not at the promise of God. The two tribes and a half were to go over Jordan with their brethren. When God, by his providence, has given us rest, we ought to consider what service we may do to our brethren.</body></html>
