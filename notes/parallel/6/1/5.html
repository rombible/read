And consider <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm" title="Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have: for he has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you.">Hebrews 13:5</a> as a combination of the two Old Testament passages.<p>(6,7) <span class= "bld">Be strong and of a good courage . . . that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law.</span>--This command to "be strong," repeated again and again to Joshua, may perhaps be taken as reflecting light upon his natural character, which might not have led him to desire so prominent a position. But it may also be observed that courage was especially needed to carry out the conquest of Canaan <span class= "ital">in the way that was ordered by the law. </span>For a discussion of this question and its difficulties, see Joshua 13<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall not any man be able to stand before thee.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">no one</span> <span class="accented">shall set himself up against thee, i.e.</span>, successfully resist thee (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">As I was with Moses.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">as I have been</span> with Moses: that is to say, was with him and remained with him unto the end. The continuity of the work of God under the old dispensation is thus as clearly marked as that of the new in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21-23</a>. The promises made to Abraham, the law given to Moses, the gift of a new life in Christ, are so many parts of one great work, and that work the regeneration of mankind. <span class="cmt_word">I will not fail thee.</span> Literally, I will not <span class="accented">be weak</span> towards thee, <span class="accented">relax</span> towards thee. God is ever the same, If His attitude to us be altered, it is not He who has changed, but ourselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-9 Joshua is to make the law of God his rule. He is charged to meditate therein day and night, that he might understand it. Whatever affairs of this world we have to mind, we must not neglect the one thing needful. All his orders to the people, and his judgments, must be according to the law of God. Joshua must himself be under command; no man's dignity or dominion sets him above the law of God. He is to encourage himself with the promise and presence of God. Let not the sense of thine own infirmities dishearten thee; God is all-sufficient. I have commanded, called, and commissioned thee to do it, and will be sure to bear thee out in it. When we are in the way of duty, we have reason to be strong and very bold. Our Lord Jesus, as Joshua here, was borne up under his sufferings by a regard to the will of God, and the commandment from his Father.</body></html>
