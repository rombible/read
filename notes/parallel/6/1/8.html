Thus the true significance of Joshua's position appears, and also the difference between Moses and all who followed him. Moses was the prophet <span class= "ital">"</span>whom the Lord knew face to face." Joshua and <span class= "ital">all </span>his successors, from the least to the greatest, find their blessing and their portion in the careful study and fulfilment of the written word of God. It is also worthy of notice that God's Word, from its very first appearance as a collective book (viz., the law), occupies the same position. It is supreme. It is set above Joshua. It is never superseded. And its authority is independent of its quantity. "The law of Moses," "Moses and the prophets," "The law, the prophets, and the Psalms," are descriptions of the Bible differing in the quantity of the matter, but not differing in the authority they exercise or in their relation to the living church. "Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy of this book, and keep those things that are written therein," are words that apply to Holy Scripture equally, in every stage, from the completion of the law of Moses to the completion of the entire book.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This book of the law.</span> The law was, therefore, embodied in a written document when the Book of Joshua was written; and as the antiquity of this Book may be regarded as proved, we may quote thus an early authority for the genuineness of at least some portions of the Pentateuch. There was a "book of the law" in Joshua's time, according to this early testimony, and we may conclude from vers. 3-7 that Deuteronomy formed a part of it (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a> for a similar precept. And for the fact see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Meditate therein</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, 63:7, 143:5, in the original. Also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Observe to do.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">keep to do</span>, thus impressing on us the care necessary in deciding on our actions. <span class="cmt_word">All that is written therein</span> (cf. for the expression <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58, 61</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-19.htm">Deuteronomy 29:19, 20, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-10.htm">Deuteronomy 30:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall have good success.</span> The word is the same as is translated "prosper" above, and <span class="accented">not</span> the same as that rendered "prosperous" in this verse. "Men," says Calvin, "never act skilfully, except in so far as they allow themselves to be ruled by the Word of God." <span class="cmt_word">Have I not commanded thee?</span> "An emphatic inquiry is a stronger form of affirmation, and is generally employed by those who wish to infuse into another courage and alacrity" (Michaelis). Moreover <span class="accented">repetition</span> is a remarkable feature of Hebrew composition, as we may observe from the second chapter of Genesis onward, and is designed to give emphasis to what is commanded or related. Calvin would lay stress on <span class="accented">I:</span> "Have not <span class="accented">I</span> commanded thee?" But this is not borne out by the Hebrew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:10-15. JOSHUA'S COMMAND TO THE PEOPLE, - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-9 Joshua is to make the law of God his rule. He is charged to meditate therein day and night, that he might understand it. Whatever affairs of this world we have to mind, we must not neglect the one thing needful. All his orders to the people, and his judgments, must be according to the law of God. Joshua must himself be under command; no man's dignity or dominion sets him above the law of God. He is to encourage himself with the promise and presence of God. Let not the sense of thine own infirmities dishearten thee; God is all-sufficient. I have commanded, called, and commissioned thee to do it, and will be sure to bear thee out in it. When we are in the way of duty, we have reason to be strong and very bold. Our Lord Jesus, as Joshua here, was borne up under his sufferings by a regard to the will of God, and the commandment from his Father.</body></html>
