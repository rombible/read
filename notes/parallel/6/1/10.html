We may compare this event, in its relation to Joshua, with the giving of the law from Sinai to Moses. Both were preceded by a three days' notice and a sanctification of the people. Both were means employed by God to establish the leaders whom He had chosen in the position which He designed for them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.">Exodus 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-11.htm" title="And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people on mount Sinai.">Exodus 19:11</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-11.htm" title="Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.">Joshua 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.">Joshua 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-14.htm" title="On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.">Joshua 4:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people.</span> The <span class="accented">Shoterim</span>, a term derived from the same root as an Arabic word signifying "to write." Different ideas have been entertained of their duties. Keil, Jahn (<span class="accented">Hebrew Commonwealth</span>), and others believe that they were genealogists; but it seems more probable that their original duties were to keep processes and minutes, and that, like our Indian "writers" and the "Master of the Rolls" at home, they exercised some kind of judicial functions, with which, moreover, active duties were sometimes combined. The idea that they were genealogists is contrary, as Gesenius shows, to the context in many places. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6-19</a>, they seem to have had to see that the specified tale of bricks was delivered up; and we know from the recently deciphered Egyptian inscriptions that very accurate registers of such matters were kept. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>, etc.) they appear to have exercised judicial functions in connection with the <span class="accented">"princes"</span> (not <span class="accented">"captains,"</span> as in our version, which would lead to the idea that they were military officers). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> they are connected with the elders. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a> they seem again to have exercised judicial functions, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-11.htm">2 Chronicles 26:11</a> their duty appears to have been to keep the muster rolls. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-7.htm">Proverbs 6:7</a> we find them once more with active duties as in the text. The LXX. equivalent; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a> by "town clerk," an officer with active as well as merely secretarial duties. Here they seem to have acted as officers of the commissariat, civil and military functions being naturally largely interchangeable in the then condition of the Israelitish people, just as they were in the early days of our Indian empire. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Joshua says to the people, Ye shall pass over Jordan, and shall possess the land; because God had said so to him. We honour the truth of God, when we stagger not at the promise of God. The two tribes and a half were to go over Jordan with their brethren. When God, by his providence, has given us rest, we ought to consider what service we may do to our brethren.</body></html>
