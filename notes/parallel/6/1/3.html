(Hence the order for the extermination of Amalek was written for Joshua [<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>] as the representative conqueror, though he did not actually carry it out.) But the conquest of Canaan, as effected by Joshua, must be carefully defined. It was a limited conquest. He took a certain number of strongholds throughout the country, and utterly crushed the armies that were opposed to him in the field. He established the people of Israel in the position that he had won. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/12-9.htm" title="The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;">Joshua 12:9-24</a> for an outline of the position.) He then divided to the tribes of Israel the whole territory, <span class= "ital">conquered and unconquered alike </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/13-1.htm" title="Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said to him, You are old and stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.">Joshua 13:1-7</a>). The Philistines and Sidonians (or Phoenicians) are examples of two great nations not conquered by Joshua, but assigned to Israel for an inheritance. Thus it appears that what Israel would conquer, <span class= "ital">the sole of his foot must tread. </span>The conquest which Joshua began for the people, must be carried out in detail by the several tribes themselves. For a further discussion of the relation of Joshua's conquest to the whole history of Israel, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-2.htm" title="This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,">Joshua 13:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every place that the sole of your foot doth tread upon.</span> These words are a quotation, almost word for word, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>, but the original promise is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-7</a>, with which we may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-9.htm">Joshua 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-30.htm">Exodus 23:30, 31</a>, etc. It was God's <span class="accented">purpose</span> that the whole land should belong to the children of Israel; a purpose which, as usual in Hebrew prophecy, is signified by the use of the perfect tense here. The conquest was intended to be complete. Not a foot's breadth was to rest in the hands of its former owners. But here, as elsewhere in Holy Writ, we may mark the way in which man's sin and want of faith has marred the purposes of God. In the Book of Judges we read that the Canaanites were not only not driven out, but that the children of Israel made marriages with them, worshipped their gods, and practised their abominations. Jerusalem remained in the hands of the Jebusites until the time of David, while the Philistines remained in possession of their portion of Palestine until it was reduced under the power of the king of Babylon. We may observe that, according to all the ordinary laws of criticism, this citation of Deuteronomy is a proof that that Book existed when the Book of Joshua was written. For the cumbrous scheme of Elohists, Jehovists, Deuteronomists, and the like, by which this natural conclusion is overruled, see Introduction. Have I given it. The preterite here denotes God's purpose (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Joshua had attended upon Moses. He who was called to honour, had been long used to business. Our Lord Jesus took upon him the form of a servant. Joshua was trained up under command. Those are fittest to rule, who have learned to obey. The removal of useful men should quicken survivors to be the more diligent in doing good. Arise, go over Jordan. At this place and at this time the banks were overflowed. Joshua had no bridge or boats, and yet he must believe that God, having ordered the people over, would open a way.</body></html>
