But its meaning is much debated among scholars. There seems no authority whatever for the translation <span class="accented">armed</span> or <span class="accented">harnessed.</span> We must either take it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to mean <span class="accented">in five divisions</span>, the usual manner of marching under Moses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.), "divided into centre, right and left wings, van and rear guard" (Ewald); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">fierce, eager, brave</span>, from a Semitic root found also in the Arabic. So Rosenmuller and Gesenius - who does not, however, as Keil asserts, derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to be fat, but from a root akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;</span> violence, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> to be pungent. The former refers to the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a>, where for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> we find <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> <span class="accented">quick.</span> The first interpretation is rendered probable by <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>, where the order of march is described as a fivefold order, and by the similarity of the word to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> five, and is not excluded by <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>, where the army, though disorganised, may have still been arranged in its fivefold divisions. The fact that there is an Arabic word, almost precisely similar, which is applied to the fivefold division of an army, makes it almost certain that this is the true meaning. But some scholars prefer to render it "brave," or "eager for war" (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>). This last word is also found in the parallel passages in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18-20</a>. Its original meaning is <span class="accented">expeditus -</span> unencumbered. See note on the last-mentioned passage. All the mighty men of valour. The number of fighting men in these tribes would be, from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-7.htm">Numbers 26:7, 18, 34</a>, remembering that <span class="accented">half</span> only of the tribe of Manasseh must be counted, between 110,000 and 111,000. But we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a> that 40,000 only of them went over. Above 70,000 must have remained behind to guard their women, children,and flocks, a precaution both reasonable and necessary. So indispensable, in fact, was it, that in this apparent discrepancy we may find one of the strongest proofs of the genuineness of our narrative. For, as Calvin remarks, in a country not yet pacified, all the women and children would infallibly have been massacred had they been left unprotected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:16-18. THE PEOPLE'S ANSWER. - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Joshua says to the people, Ye shall pass over Jordan, and shall possess the land; because God had said so to him. We honour the truth of God, when we stagger not at the promise of God. The two tribes and a half were to go over Jordan with their brethren. When God, by his providence, has given us rest, we ought to consider what service we may do to our brethren.</body></html>
