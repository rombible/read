and the LORD said to him, You are old and stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.">Joshua 13:1-14</a>).<p>(b) According to its boundaries.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Joshua was old and stricken in years.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">he had aged, and was advanced in days. </span>Old is too absolute a word. He did not live beyond a hundred and ten years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-29.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.">Joshua 24:29</a>), and this was not a great age for the time. But in several instances the Hebrew word here employed is used not so much in respect of the number of years men lived, but rather in regard to the weakening of the vital powers. So it is said in Genesis 27, "Isaac was old," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>he had aged, for he lived forty-three years after that. So in regard to David, "the king was very old," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>much aged, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-15.htm" title="And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king.">1Kings 1:15</a>, for he could not have been more than seventy when he died. The hardships and anxieties of his life had aged him. So it was perhaps with Joshua. Moses was a signal exception; he had not aged at one hundred and twenty. But Jehovah constantly talked with Moses, and knew him face to face; and may we not say that <span class= "ital">that </span>heavenly intercourse even sustained the vital powers? The work of the Lord, though it be successfully carried on, as it was by Joshua, may wear men out by its very excitement. But personal intercourse with Him is like eating of the tree of life, and "in His presence is the fulness of joy." In this personal intercourse Moses was more highly favoured than his successor, Joshua.<p>(1, 7) <span class= "bld">There remaineth yet very much land to be possessed . . . Now therefore divide this land.</span>--The land had still to be <span class= "ital">inherited</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>not overrun, or conquered, as far as it could be said to be conquered by defeating the armies that took the field; all this was done already, but the land had not passed out of the hands of its actual possessors into the hands of Israel. It is remarkable that we have here a distinct order given to Joshua to divide to Israel land which was <span class= "ital">not yet conquered. </span>In these verses several nations are named--viz., the Philistines, the Geshurites, the Avites, the Giblites, the Sidonians, besides anything more which may be included in the sometimes generic, and sometimes more specific, name of the Canaanites. Of these tribes, the Philistines and "all the Sidonians" (or Ph?nicians) were certainly not yet conquered. Can we say that they were ever conquered at any period in the history of the kingdom of all Israel, except in so far as they were reduced to the condition of tributaries?<p>We may say, then, that while the list of kings in Joshua 12 represents the territory in that aspect in which it was conquered, by the reduction of a number of fortified posts and strongholds, and the subjugation of all the principal rulers of the country, the description of its boundaries in Joshua 13 represents it as not yet conquered--viz., as still containing several nations whom the Israelites must dispossess when God gave them the opportunity and ordered them to drive them out.<p>It is important to mark clearly the distinction between the work done by Joshua and the work left for Israel. Joshua overthrew the ruling powers of Palestine, destroyed the kingdoms, defeated the armies, and captured the fortresses to such an extent as to give Israel a firm foothold in the country. But he did not exterminate the population from every portion even of that territory which he distributed to the several tribes. And there were several nations--of whom the Philistines and Ph?nicians were the chief--whom he left entirely intact. The purpose of this is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/2-20.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;">Judges 2:20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/3-1.htm" title="Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;">Judges 3:1-4</a>. The work done by Joshua was thus distinctly limited.<p>The work left for Israel was partly similar to that which Joshua had done, and partly different. It was the same when any great war broke out between Israel and the unconquered nations: for example, in the time of Deborah and Barak, or in the wars with the Philistines. But for the most part it was entirely different, and was the completion of the conquest of the land in detail throughout the several towns and villages. But how was this to be effected? Certainly <span class= "ital">not </span>after the manner of the capture of Laish by the Danites, described in Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-27.htm" title="And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,">Joshua 18:27</a>), when they came "unto a people that were at quiet and secure; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire." The rules laid down in the law of Moses were to be the guiding principle for Israel, as also for Joshua. The seventh and twelfth chapters of Deuteronomy give them clearly, and they are these.<p>(1) Utter extermination of the nations <span class= "ital">when Jehovah should deliver them up</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>not at the pleasure of Israel, but at the Divine decree. The signal for this extermination was generally a determined and obstinate attack on Israel. "It was of the Lord to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might destroy them utterly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-20.htm" title="For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.">Joshua 11:20</a>). But while they "stood still in their strength" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-13.htm" title="But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.">Joshua 11:13</a>) they were usually unmolested.<p>(2) The destruction of all traces of idolatry in the conquered territory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/12-1.htm" title="These are the statutes and judgments, which you shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of your fathers gives you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.">Deuteronomy 12:1-2</a> : "In the land which the Lord God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it . . . ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods . . . overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and . . . hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place." So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm" title="The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). All investigation of idolatrous practices and usages was forbidden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-30.htm" title="Take heed to yourself that you be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before you; and that you inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.">Deuteronomy 12:30</a>).<p>(3) No covenant or treaty was to be made between Israel and the nations of Canaan, and all intermarriage was prohibited. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/7-2.htm" title="And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall smite them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:">Deuteronomy 7:2-3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/23-12.htm" title="Else if you do in any wise go back, and join to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you:">Joshua 23:12-13</a>.)<p>Of these rules, the first entails responsibility, chiefly upon the leaders--as Joshua and his successors; the second and third, upon all the people. And on the observance or non-observance of the two latter rules the completion of the conquest in detail very much depended. It is obvious that the persistent and general destruction of objects of Canaanitish worship, with the refusal to make treaties or intermarry, would tend to perpetuate a state of irritation in the minds of the Canaanites. Had these rules been faithfully observed, there would have been constant outbreaks of hostility, terminating in the further and more rapid extermination of the enemies of Israel, or else in their absolute submission to Israelitish law; and thus the entire conquest would have been completed in a comparatively short time. But, in fact, the second and third rules were constantly broken. Mixed marriages were common, and idolatry was maintained instead of being destroyed. Hence Israelites and Canaanites were mingled together, and it became impossible to carry out Rule 1; for one set of inhabitants could not be exterminated without inflicting serious injury upon the other.<p>When we consider the above rules, it is impossible not to be struck with the wisdom of them when regarded as a means to the proposed end. We are also able to understand more clearly why so much stress was laid upon the necessity of adherence to the <span class= "ital">Book of the Law </span>in Joshua's commission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/1-6.htm" title="Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.">Joshua 1:6-8</a>). The fact that these rules are <span class= "ital">not </span>what human nature would be at all disposed to obey continuously and as a matter of set practice (have they ever been observed yet in any conquest recorded in history?) is worth noting, as a proof of the undesigned veracity of the story. It is a mark of thorough consistency between the law and the history of Israel. And if the authorship of Deuteronomy belonged to the late date which some claim for it, how could we account for the insertion of a law which was never kept, and could not be kept at the time when some suppose it was written? From the days of Solomon and thenceforward, the relation of the remnant of the conquered Canaanites to Israel was fixed. The Ph?nicians and Philistines maintained a separate national existence to the last.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - NOW <span class="cmt_word">Joshua was old.</span> This is usually regarded as the second part of the Book of Joshua; the first being devoted to the history of the conquest of Palestine, while the second is engaged with the history of its division among the conquerors. Dean Stanley, in his 'Sinai and Palestine,' as well as in his 'Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church,' describes this portion of the Book of Judges as the 'Domes. day Book' of the land of Canaan, and the remark has been constantly repeated. There is, however, a considerable difference between the great survey of the Conqueror and this one. The former was an accurate account, for purposes of taxation, national detente, and public order, of the exact extent of soil owned by each landowner, and it went so far as to enumerate the cattle on his estate, to the great disgust of the Saxon chronicler, who had an Englishman's dislike of inquisitorial proceedings. There is no trace either of such completeness, or of such an inquisitorial character in this survey, neither has it quite the same object. It assigns to each tribe the limits of its future possessions, and enumerates the cities contained in each portion of territory. Bat it makes scarcely any effort to describe the possessions of particular families, still less of individual landowners. Joshua and Caleb are the only exceptions. Knobel observes that the most powerful tribes were first settled in their territory - those, namely, of Judah and Joseph. He remarks that the author must have had written sources for his information, for no single Israelite could have been personally acquainted with all the details here given. <span class="cmt_word">And stricken in years.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">advanced in age.</span> There is no foundation for the idea of some commentators that the Jews, at the time this book was written, made any formal distinction in these words between different stages of old age. The Hebrew language rejoiced in repetition, and this common phrase is only a means of adding emphasis to the statement already made. <span class="cmt_word">And there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> is stronger than our version. Perhaps the best equivalent in modern English is, <span class="accented">"And the amount of land that remaineth for us to occupy is very great indeed."</span> We may observe here that, as with the literal so with the spiritual Israel, whether the antitype be the Christian Church or the human heart, the work of subduing God's enemies is gradual. One successful engagement does not conclude the war. The enemy renews his assaults, and when force fails he tries fraud; when direct temptations are of no avail he resorts to enticements. The only safeguard in the war is strength, alertness, courage, patience. The faint hearted and unwatchful alike fail in the contest, which can be carried on successfully only by him who has learned to keep guard over himself, and to direct his ways by the counsels of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 At this chapter begins the account of the dividing of the land of Canaan among the tribes of Israel by lot; a narrative showing the performance of the promise made to the fathers, that this land should be given to the seed of Jacob. We are not to pass over these chapters of hard names as useless. Where God has a mouth to speak, and a hand to write, we should find an ear to hear, and an eye to read; and may God give us a heart to profit! Joshua is supposed to have been about one hundred years old at this time. It is good for those who are old and stricken in years to be put in remembrance of their being so. God considers the frame of his people, and would not have them burdened with work above their strength. And all people, especially old people, should set to do that quickly which must be done before they die, lest death prevent them, Ec 9:10. God promise that he would make the Israelites masters of all the countries yet unsubdued, through Joshua was old, and not able to do it; old, and not likely to live to see it done. Whatever becomes of us, and however we may be laid aside as despised, broken vessels, God will do his own work in his own time. We must work out our salvation, then God will work in us, and work with us; we must resist our spiritual enemies, then God will tread them under our feet; we must go forth to our Christian work and warfare, then God will go forth before us.</body></html>
