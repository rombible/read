The Greeks called it <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. So Virgil says of it, "AEgyptum nigra foecundat arena." The Vulgate has "a fluvio turbido qui irrigat AEgyptum." The LXX. translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The phrase which is "before" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Egypt seems to exclude the idea of the Nile, since the Nile flowed through the centre of Egypt, and it is impossible to make <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>. As Drusins remarks, moreover, the Nile is always called either <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> or "the river of Egypt." The interpreation which has found most favour of late, therefore, refers this expression to a small river that flows into the sea at the extreme southern border of Palestine. This river was known as the "river of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), and is now called the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Arisch</span> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4, 47</a>, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, where the word is <span class="accented">nahal</span>, or <span class="accented">winter torrent</span>, a word inapplicable to the Nile). For Sihor, or Shichor, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>, which seems decisive against the Nile. <span class="cmt_word">Which is counted to the Canaanite.</span> These words are connected by the Masorites with what follows: <span class="accented">The five lords of the Philistines are reckoned to the Canaanite.<span class="cmt_word"></span> The five lords of the Philistines.</span> The Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-12.htm">1 Chronicles 1:12</a>) are supposed to be of Egyptian origin. Ewald (also Hitzig, 'Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' p. 20) believes Caphtor to be Crete, and supposes the Cherethites and Pelethites who formed David's body-guard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>) to be Cretans and Philistines (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>). But this opinion is disputed by many commentators of note, and is far from probable in itself. They were David's most trusted and faithful troops, and it seems hardly probable that so truly national a monarch would have assigned the post of honour around his person to the hereditary enemies of his race. Ritter, however, believes the Cherethites and Pelethites to be Philistines, and appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>, and still more forcibly to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4, 5</a>. It should be remembered, too, that Ittai was a Gittite, or native of Gath (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>). The term here used, translated <span class="accented">lords</span> (<span class="accented">satraps</span>, LXX.), is peculiar to the Philistines. It is to be found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8</a>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a> the word means an <span class="accented">axle</span>, or perhaps the outside plating of the wheel, and in the kindred languages it signifies a wheel. The expression is remarkable in connection with the phrase "circles of the Philistines." <span class="cmt_word">The Eshkalalonites.</span> The inhabitants of Ashkelon, as the Gittites are of Gath. <span class="cmt_word">Also the Avites.</span> Literally, "and <span class="accented">the Avites."</span> There is no "also" in the original, though the Avites or Avim are supposed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, and note on Geshuri in the last verse)to have been aborigines preceding the Canaanites, and dispossessed by the Philistines. Keil, however, disputes this view, and holds that we have no evidence that any but a Canaanitish people dwelt in southwestern Palestine. This Canaanitish tribe, he thinks, was driven out by the Philistines. Some few of the Avites, or rather Avvites, continued to dwell among their conquerors. But the coincidence between <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-22.htm">Deuteronomy 2:22, 23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>, makes strongly for Ewald's view above. And Keil and Delitzsch, in their later joint work, incline to it. See Introduction III. The word Avvim, like Havoth, or Havvoth (see ver. 30), is supposed to mean villages, or inhabited enclosures. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 At this chapter begins the account of the dividing of the land of Canaan among the tribes of Israel by lot; a narrative showing the performance of the promise made to the fathers, that this land should be given to the seed of Jacob. We are not to pass over these chapters of hard names as useless. Where God has a mouth to speak, and a hand to write, we should find an ear to hear, and an eye to read; and may God give us a heart to profit! Joshua is supposed to have been about one hundred years old at this time. It is good for those who are old and stricken in years to be put in remembrance of their being so. God considers the frame of his people, and would not have them burdened with work above their strength. And all people, especially old people, should set to do that quickly which must be done before they die, lest death prevent them, Ec 9:10. God promise that he would make the Israelites masters of all the countries yet unsubdued, through Joshua was old, and not able to do it; old, and not likely to live to see it done. Whatever becomes of us, and however we may be laid aside as despised, broken vessels, God will do his own work in his own time. We must work out our salvation, then God will work in us, and work with us; we must resist our spiritual enemies, then God will tread them under our feet; we must go forth to our Christian work and warfare, then God will go forth before us.</body></html>
