This gives a better sense than joining it to what follows. For the south was not "all the land of the Canaanites," but a large part of it belonged, as we have just seen, to a tribe not of Canaanitish origin, while the land of the Canaanites (see note on Joshua 3:10) extended far to the northward. Therefore we must understand the words "all the land of the Canaanites" to begin a fresh section, and to be descriptive of the territory extending from Philistia northward towards Sidon. So the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic. <span class="cmt_word">Mearah</span>. The margin has "the cave." But there is no article in the original The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> for Mearah, having clearly, as Masius observes, substituted Zain for Resh. But this mistaken reading compels a mistranslation of the passage. Vandevelde supposes it to be a remarkable cave still existing near Sidon, which is mentioned by William of Tyre as having been fortified by the Crusaders. He speaks of it as <span class="accented">municipium quoddam</span>, and states that it was commonly known as the "cave of Tyre." "spelunca inexpugnabilis." It was afterwards "the last retreat of the Emir Fakkr-ed-Din" (Vandevelde, s.v. Mearah). There is a village now, north of Sidon, called Mog-heiriyeh, or the village of the cave. So also Kuobel. <span class="cmt_word">Beside the Sidonians.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">near</span>, or <span class="accented">in the direction of</span>, or <span class="accented">which belong to the</span> Sidonians. <span class="cmt_word">Aphek</span>. Or <span class="accented">Aphekah.</span> This (Knobel) was the northern Aphek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-30.htm">Joshua 19:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>), in the tribe of Asher, known later as Aphaca, and now as Afka. Not the Aphekah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>, probably the Aphek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>. It is the same Aphek which in later times was captured by the Syrians, and was the scene of several decisive victories of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>). It is doubtful which Aphek is meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-18.htm">Joshua 12:18</a>, though it is probably the southern Aphek. The situation is described as one of "rare beauty" (Delitzsch), "on the northwest slopes of Lebanon," amid exquisite groves (Conder). Here the Syrian Astarte was worshipped, and the ruins of her temple, dedicated to her as mourning for Tammuz, or Adonis, may still be seen. See Kenrick, 'Phoenicia,' 310,311, and Mover's 'Die Phonizier,' 1:192. Perhaps it was never actually occupied by the Asherites, but remained in the hands of Syria, and as a place of great resort was the natural point to which the attacks of Israel would be directed. Vandevelde, however, believes in four and Conder in <span class="accented">seven</span> cities of this name, and they suppose the Aphek which was the scene of the battle with the Syrians to have been on the east of Jordan, from the occurrence of the word "Mishor" in the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>. The term "Mishor" is, however, applied to other places beside the territory east of Jordan (see Gesenius, s.v. Mishor). The Aphek in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a> cannot be identified with any that have been named. <span class="cmt_word">To the borders of the Amorites.</span> This can hardly be anything but the northern border of the kingdom of Bashan, in the neighbourhood of Mount Hermon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 At this chapter begins the account of the dividing of the land of Canaan among the tribes of Israel by lot; a narrative showing the performance of the promise made to the fathers, that this land should be given to the seed of Jacob. We are not to pass over these chapters of hard names as useless. Where God has a mouth to speak, and a hand to write, we should find an ear to hear, and an eye to read; and may God give us a heart to profit! Joshua is supposed to have been about one hundred years old at this time. It is good for those who are old and stricken in years to be put in remembrance of their being so. God considers the frame of his people, and would not have them burdened with work above their strength. And all people, especially old people, should set to do that quickly which must be done before they die, lest death prevent them, Ec 9:10. God promise that he would make the Israelites masters of all the countries yet unsubdued, through Joshua was old, and not able to do it; old, and not likely to live to see it done. Whatever becomes of us, and however we may be laid aside as despised, broken vessels, God will do his own work in his own time. We must work out our salvation, then God will work in us, and work with us; we must resist our spiritual enemies, then God will tread them under our feet; we must go forth to our Christian work and warfare, then God will go forth before us.</body></html>
