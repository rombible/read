It was no doubt some short distance to the westward of this chief city of the Ammonites (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>, where the Gadites are said to have built it). These two are probably the "cities of Aroer" referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a> (but see next note but one, where also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a> will be discussed). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A city in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-28.htm">1 Samuel 30:28</a>). To one of these cities probably belonged Shammah or Shammoth, the Hararite or Harorite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>; he is called Harodite in ver. 25, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-27.htm">1 Chronicles 11:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The river Arnon</span> (see note on Joshua 12:2). <span class="cmt_word">The city that is in the midst of the river.</span> This city (or perhaps cities) has received but little attention from commentators, probably by reason of its bearing no name. Those who have tried to identify it have failed In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>, in this passage, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a>, it is mentioned in connection with Aroer. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>, instead of "the city that is in the midst of the river," we find simply "the middle (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5da;</span>) of the river." But as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a> stands in our version, the city referred to stood in the middle of the <span class="accented">river of Gad.</span> This would suggest the idea that the old derivation of Aroer by Wells and others from the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (city) doubled, with the signification of the <span class="accented">double city</span>, is nearer the mark than that of <span class="accented">wasteness</span>, or <span class="accented">desolateness</span>, or nakedness, as of a region bare of trees, which has found favour of late, and it is not without support in Hebrew forms. A city, moreover, in the midst of or "on the brink of" a winter torrent would be less likely to be waste or desolate than in other situations. But we are not yet at the end of our difficulties. The word Nahal, which comes before Gad in the passage of which we are now speaking, has the article. Thus the translation, "river of Gad" cannot be maintained. And besides, the enumeration of the people must have begun at the Arnon, or southern border of Israel beyond Jordan. It is possible that the text may be corrupt here, as it is in other parts of 2 Samuel, and possibly the meaning may be that the officers pitched in Aroer, passed through Reuben, and having come within the confines of Gad arrived at Jazer. This again is rendered doubtful by the close connection of Aroer and Jazer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>. It is of course, therefore, possible that the reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>. is to the Jabbok, not the Arnon ravine. A question, of such intricacy can only be Settled, if settled at all, by an investigation on. the spot. <span class="cmt_word">The plain.</span> The word here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>. This derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> signifies level ground, and is applied to the region north of Moab, especially that part of it which belonged to Reuben. Flat, and almost unbroken, even by trees, it was particularly adapted for grazing land (see also note above, and on ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Medeba</span>. This is mentioned in Scripture, together with Dibon, as here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>. It was on the level ground before mentioned (see Gesenius, s.v. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>). Dibon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18, 22</a>, called Dimon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-9.htm">Isaiah 15:9</a>; but Dibon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-45.htm">Numbers 33:45, 46</a>). It was one of the cities built by the children of Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>). It is now called Dhiban, and is a short distance north of the Arnon. The Moabite stone, found at Dibon in 1868, mentions the occupation of Medeba by Omri, and implies that Dibon, the principal city in those parts, was also subject to him, but recovered finally by Mesha. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:7-33 The land must be divided among the tribes. It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.</body></html>
