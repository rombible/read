This is idenitified with Ramoth-Gilead by Vandevelde, and must have been the Mizpeh of Gilead mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>. It is supposed to be identical with the place called Mizpah, Galeed, and Jegar-sahadutha by Jacob and Laban respectively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-47.htm">Genesis 31:47-49</a>). If it be the same as Ramoth-Gilead, it is the scene of the celebrated battle against the Syrians, in which Ahab lost his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>.), and where the fall of the dynasty of Omri was brought about by the revolt of Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9</a>.). Conder, however, thinks the two are distinct places, and fixes Ramoth-Mizpeh on the north border of Gad, about 25 reties west of Bozrah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mahanaim</span> The dual of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;</span> <span class="accented">two hosts</span> or <span class="accented">camps.</span> It received its name from Jacob, who with his own company met the angels of God, and who commemorated the meeting by this name (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). Here Ishbesheth was crowned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>). Here David took refuge when he crossed the Jordan, to avoid falling into the hands of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Debir</span>. Not the Debir mentioned in ch. 10, but another Debir in the land of Gilead, whose site is unknown. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:7-33 The land must be divided among the tribes. It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.</body></html>
