The orders given were, "Avenge the Lord of Midian" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm" title="From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:">Joshua 13:3</a>); "avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-2.htm" title="This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,">Joshua 13:2</a>), because they tempted Israel to idolatry and uncleanness. But this verse in Joshua supplies us with a further reason for hostilities between Midian and Israel. The Midianites were "dukes of Sihon," and a part of his government. Through them he appears to have exercised his dominion over the conquered territory which he had taken from Moab. This land Israel had now, in turn, taken from him. But in order to its complete subjugation, the removal of Sihon's dukes, the princes or kings of Midian, was also necessary. This was brought about in the manner described in Numbers 22-25, , 31. The relation between Midian and Moab which is <span class= "ital">implied, </span>but not explained in Numbers, is explained by the apparently casual remark in this place. It is another example of undesigned agreement between Joshua and the Pentateuch. Of the same kind is the allusion to Balaam, as (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-22.htm" title="Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.">Joshua 13:22</a>) <span class= "ital">the soothsayer, </span>or <span class= "ital">diviner. </span>In Numbers we do not read of anything but prophecy and counsel as coming from Balaam's lips; but it is abundantly evident, from hints scattered through the story, that he was a <span class= "ital">sooth-sayer, </span>or <span class= "ital">diviner, </span>as well as a prophet. The elders of Moab and Midian went to him with the reward of <span class= "ital">divination </span>in their hands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-7.htm" title="And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.">Numbers 22:7</a>); "Neither is there any <span class= "ital">divination </span>against Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-23.htm" title="Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God worked!">Numbers 23:23</a>) the word in each of these places is radically connected with the epithet applied to Balaam here. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-1.htm" title="And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.">Numbers 24:1</a> : "He went not, <span class= "ital">as at other times, </span>to seek for <span class= "ital">enchantments"</span>--where a different word is employed.) He is thus shown to have been an unscrupulous man, who, if he could not obtain the knowledge that he desired from above, would not hesitate to seek it from below, that he might secure his base gain.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cities of the plain.</span> "Mishor" once more. See above, ver. 9, not as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where the word is <span class="accented">Ciccar.</span> These, therefore, were not Sodom and its neighbours, but cities of the Amorites. Such touches as this, which display the minute acquaintance of our author with his subject, are almost of a necessity lost in a translation. But where our version has "plain," the original has Mishor when the uplands of Gilead and Bashan are meant, Arabah when the writer is speaking of the Wadys in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea, Shephelah when he refers to the lowlands of Western palestine, bordering on the Mediterranean, Bik'ah when he speaks of the great valley of Coele Syria, Ciccar when he speaks of the territory due north of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">With the princes of Midian.</span> The word here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> signifies <span class="accented">exalted persons</span>, persons of rank, as we should say. It would seem to imply rather civil functions than the more absolute authority which the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> also rendered "prince" in Hebrew, carries with it. With this passage compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>. The Hebrew has no "with," so that the difficulty some have found in the passage need not have arisen. It is nowhere said that Moses smote the "princes of Midian" together with Sihon. All that is stated is that they, as well as Sihon, were smitten, as the history in Numbers tells us they were. Dukes of Sihon. According to Gesenius, Rosenmiiller, and others, the word here translated "dukes" is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> <span class="accented">to pour out</span>, means "anointed." See Psalm if. 6, where it is translated "set." But Keil rejects this interpretation, and says that the word never signifies to anoint. It is always used, he says, of <span class="accented">foreign</span> princes. But he has overlooked <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> (Hebrews). See Knobel, who explains it of drink offerings, and regards these "dukes" as men pledged by a solemn treaty to be Sihon's allies, though not vassals. Kimchi thinks that Sihon, before his reverses at the hand of Israel, had held some authority in Midian, and these were his prefects, or under-kings. The term is applied to Zebah and Zalmunna in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-12.htm">Psalm 83:12</a> (in the Hebrew). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:7-33 The land must be divided among the tribes. It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.</body></html>
