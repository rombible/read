Of Ephraim and Manasseh, Jacob had said to Joseph, "as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine:" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> though grandsons, they shall count as sons of Jacob, and each one shall be the head of a tribe. Thus there are two ways of counting Jacob's sons, each making twelve; and these two seem to be recognised as distinct in Exodus 28. There we are told that the high priest should bear the names of the children of Israel on his shoulders <span class= "ital">according to their birth </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Joseph being counted as well as Levi, but not Ephraim and Manasseh). On his breastplate he must have them <span class= "ital">according to the twelve tribes </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Ephraim and Manasseh being specified, but Joseph and Levi left out). Both ways of reckoning were necessary in order that the complete Israel might be represented by the high priest. And in each way the number <span class= "ital">twelve </span>was preserved and emphasised, as it is evidently intended to be in this place,<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By lot was their inheritance.</span> The commentators, following the Rabbis, have amused themselves by speculations <span class="accented">how</span> the lot was taken. The question is of no great practical importance; but no doubt the contrivance was a very primitive one, as the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> a small pebble, used here, seems to imply. What is of more importance is the fact that the distribution of territory was the result of no one's caprice, or ambition, or intrigue. The whole matter was referred to God, and the leader of the Israelitish hosts and the high priest presided over the ceremony. It was a common belief among the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, that the use of the lot was to refer the matter to a Divine decision. So we read in the Proverbs, "The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>; cf. 18:18). It is a strong evidence for the truth of this narrative that we read of no conflicts between the various tribes respecting the division of territory. Jealousies sprung up between the tribes, as the narratives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8.htm">Judges 8, 9, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>, are sufficient to show. But in no one case was there any complaint of unfairness, any attempt to disturb the territorial arrangement made at the time of the original settlement in Palestine. There can be little doubt that Keil is right in supposing this original division to have been in outline merely. It is obvious from the onward course of the narrative (especially ch. 18.) that no very minute accuracy in detail could possibly have been arrived at. The country was roughly mapped out at first, and the complete adjustment of boundaries was a matter which would naturally be put off until the land were actually in possession. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 The Israelites must occupy the new conquests. Canaan would have been subdued in vain, if it had not been inhabited. Yet every man might not go and settle where he pleased. God shall choose our inheritance for us. Let us survey our heritage of present mercy, our prospect for the land of promise, eternal in the heavens. Is God any respecter of persons? Is it not better that our place, as to earthly good or sorrow, should be determined by the infinite wisdom of our heavenly Father, than by our own ignorance? Should not those for whom the great mystery of godliness was exhibited, those whose redemption was purchased by Jesus Christ, thankfully refer their earthly concerns to his appointment?</body></html>
