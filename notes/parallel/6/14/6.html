but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.">Joshua 15:63</a>).<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Caleb the son of Jephunneh</span>--Caleb was the commissioner appointed from the tribe of Judah to divide the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-19.htm" title="And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.">Numbers 34:19</a>). His coming forward on this occasion to ask for his own inheritance first of all might appear to savour of self-interest, if the post of honour for which he applied had not been also the most dangerous and difficult position in the inheritance of his tribe. He applied for the territory of the gigantic sons of Anak, whom he undertook to drive out in the strength of Jehovah. Therefore "Joshua blessed him" and gave him Hebron for his inheritance. It is noticeable that of the two faithful spies whom Moses sent, Caleb received his inheritance <span class= "ital">first, </span>and Joshua <span class= "ital">last </span>of all Israel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-49.htm" title="When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:">Joshua 19:49</a>.) The characters of the two men are well seen in this contrast--the one foremost in a service of danger; the other <span class= "ital">last </span>to seek the things that were his own. Thus, "even Christ pleased not Himself" (comp. Joshua); but "the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me," as the conquest of the sons of Anak fell to the lot of Caleb. Observe how the slayer of Goliath is said to take away the <span class= "ital">reproach </span>from Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm" title="And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?">1Samuel 17:26</a>. <span class= "ital">"</span>Who can stand before the children of Anak?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In Gilgal</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite.</span> Or, <span class="accented">descendant of Kenaz</span>, as was his kinsman Othniel. As far as we can make out from the genealogy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2.htm">1 Chronicles 2</a>, Caleb and Kenaz were family names, for the Caleb or Calubi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>) the son of Hezron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>), the Caleb the son of Hur (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>), and Caleb the son of Jephunneh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-15.htm">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>), could not have been the same persons. And Caleb was a Kenezite, or descendant of Kenaz; he had a grandson, apparently, of that name (so the LXX. and Vulgate translate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-15.htm">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>), and a brother, according to the most probable rendering of the Hebrew of both <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-9.htm">Judges 1:9</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-13.htm">1 Chronicles 4:13</a>. For Caleb was the son of Jephunneh, not of Kenaz. Hitzig, 'Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' 1:105, thinks that Caleb was a descendant of the Kenaz mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>; or, see 15. Some think he was a Kenizzite (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>). The Bishop of Bath and Wells, in his article in Smiths 'Dictionary of the Bible,' thinks that the view that he was not of Jewish origin agrees best with the Scripture narrative, and removes many difficulties regarding the number of the children of Israel at the Exodus. It certainly serves to explain why the tribe of Judah came with Caleb, when he preferred his request, and the statement in ch. 15:13, which seems to imply that Caleb was not one of the tribe of Judah by birth, but one of the "mixed multitude" that went up with the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>), and acquired afterwards by circumcision the rights of Israelites. If this be the case, it is an illustration of the truth declared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm">Romans 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>. By his faithfulness to God he had well earned the reward which he now sought. <span class="cmt_word">Concerning me and thee.</span> And yet Knobel asserts that, according to vers. 8 and 12, Joshua was not one of the spies! He accordingly sees the hand of the "Jehovist" here. So accurate is the criticism which pretends to be able to disintegrate the narratives in the Hebrew Scriptures, and to assign each part to its separate author (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>). As well might we conclude that this verse in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>. is by a different hand to vers. 30 and 38 in the same chapter, in spite of the obvious coherence of the whole narrative. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:6-15 Caleb's request is, Give me this mountain, or Hebron, because it was formerly in God's promise to him, and he would let Israel knows how much he valued the promise. Those who live by faith value that which is given by God's promise, far above what is given by his providence only. It was now in the Anakims' possession, and Caleb would let Israel know how little he feared the enemy, and that he would encourage them to push on their conquests. Caleb answered to his name, which signifies all heart. Hebron was settled on Caleb and his heirs, because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. Happy are we if we follow him. Singular piety shall be crowned with singular favour.</body></html>
