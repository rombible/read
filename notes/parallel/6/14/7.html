The spies were sent from Kadesh-barnea in the second year of the Exodus, about 38� years before the passage of Jordan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-14.htm" title="And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.">Deuteronomy 2:14</a>). Thus Caleb would be 40+38=78 years old when they crossed the Jordan. He was 85 when they began to divide the country. Therefore the conquest itself must have extended over a period of seven years. It is manifest that the record of the capture of Jericho and Ai, with the two campaigns of Joshua against the southern and northern confederacies, does not give <span class= "ital">all </span>the details of the war.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forty years old.</span> The Hebrew expression is "the son of forty years."

The LXX. reads "according to <span class="accented">his</span> mind," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that of Moses. Houbigant and Le Clerc approve of this reading, but it seems quite out of keeping with the character of Caleb. He did not endeavour to accommodate his report to the wishes of any man, but gave what he himself believed to be a true and faithful account of what he had seen and heard (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-7.htm">Numbers 14:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-36.htm">Deuteronomy 1:36</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:6-15 Caleb's request is, Give me this mountain, or Hebron, because it was formerly in God's promise to him, and he would let Israel knows how much he valued the promise. Those who live by faith value that which is given by God's promise, far above what is given by his providence only. It was now in the Anakims' possession, and Caleb would let Israel know how little he feared the enemy, and that he would encourage them to push on their conquests. Caleb answered to his name, which signifies all heart. Hebron was settled on Caleb and his heirs, because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. Happy are we if we follow him. Singular piety shall be crowned with singular favour.</body></html>
