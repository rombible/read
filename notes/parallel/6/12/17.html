It is difficult say whether this was Tappuah in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a>; cf. ver. 53), or in Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7, 8</a>). The mention of Aphekah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>, and of Aphek here, would suggest the former, or the mention of Socoh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a> (see below on Hepher). But the mention of Lasharon, the fact that there is more than one other Aphek, that Tappuah on the borders of Ephraim and Manasseh seems to have been an important city, and that the cities of the south are mentioned first, those of the north afterwards, and that Tappuah seems to lie about midway, suggest the more northern city. This is Knobel's opinion. Gesenius inclines to the southern Tappuah. Conder identifies it with Yassfif, at the head of the Wady Kanah, southeast of Shechem. Vandevelde with Atuf, four hours northeast by east from Shechem. Keil prefers the former site. <span class="cmt_word">Hepher</span>. This appears, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-10.htm">1 Kings 4:10</a>, to have been near to Socoh, but nothing more is known of it. <span class="cmt_word">Aphek.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">fortress</span>, though some think it comes from a Syriac root kindred to the Hebrew, signifying to <span class="accented">hold fast</span>, to <span class="accented">embrace</span>, and that it has reference to the sensual worship of Ashtaroth and Thammuz. There were several towns of this name (see notes on Joshua 13:4; 15:53; 19:30). <span class="cmt_word">Lasharon</span> is probably the same as Sharon, or Hasharon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>). This is the plain between Joppa and Carmel (Vandevelde). Conder and Kuobel identify with Sarona, or Saroneh, a place near the sea of Tiberias. See, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32-38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Madon</span> is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>, and has been conjecturally identified with Madin, near the sea of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">Shimron-meron</span> is also mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>. It appears among the cities assigned to Zebulun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>. Ewald ('Hist. Israel,' 2:2 c.) remarks on 'the antiquity of this list, referring as it does to cities which are never heard of again. <span class="cmt_word">Achshaph</span> lay within the borders of Asher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-25.htm">Joshua 19:25</a>). It has been supposed to be the modern Yasif, near the shores of the Mediterranean (see note on Joshua 11:1). <span class="cmt_word">Taanach and Megiddo</span> are frequently mentioned together (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>). The former became a Levitical city. The latter, being in the great plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon, lay in the way of most Eastern conquerors. Hence we find it mentioned in the Karnak inscription by the name of Magedi in the victorious expedition of Thothmes III., in which "the whole of the Syrian, Palestinian, and Arabian nations were overcome and forced to pay tribute." (Cooper, 'Egyptian Obelisks,' p. 33; see also 'Records of the Past,' 1:30). The great battle on the slopes of Mount Tabor was carried on as far as Megiddo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>). Not far from this were the Midianites pitched, who fell victims to the valour of Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>). Another and a disastrous battle of Megiddo, against the king of Egypt, weakened Judaea, and caused it to fall an easy victory to the power of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>. The valley of Megiddo, or Megiddon, is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>. Solomon fortified Megiddo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), assigned it to Baana, the son of Ahilud, with Taanach, as one of the cities required to provide food for the royal household (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>.) And the Jewish writer of the Apocalypse makes this great battlefield of his race the scene of the battle of the great day of the Almighty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14, 16</a>). For Armageddon is Har Mageddon, the mountain of Mageddon, or Megiddo. Megiddo and Taanach are also found in later periods of Egyptian history. The Mohar mentioned above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>) notices the former among the places he visited ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2), while the latter is among the places captured by Shishak, as an inscription testifies. The latest explorers reject the identification with Lcgio, or Lejjun, and suggest Mejedda, at the foot of Gilboa, near Beth-shean. See Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Paper, January, 1877. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-24 We have here the limits of the country Joshua conquered. A list is given of the kings subdued by Israel: thirty-one in all. This shows how fruitful Canaan then was, in which so many chose to throng together. This was the land God appointed for Israel; yet in our day it is one of the most barren and unprofitable countries in the world. Such is the effect of the curse it lies under, since its possessors rejected Christ and his gospel, as was foretold by Moses, De 29:23. The vengeance of a righteous God, inflicted on all these kings and their subjects, for their wickedness, should make us dread and hate sin. The fruitful land bestowed on his chosen people, should fill our hearts with hope and confidence in his mercy, and with humble gratitude.</body></html>
