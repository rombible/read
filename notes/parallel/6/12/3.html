So also below. <span class="cmt_word">The way to Beth-jeshimoth</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-48.htm">Numbers 33:48, 49</a>). There was a desert tract near the Dead Sea called Jeshimon, or the waste district. It is described by travellers as the most arid portion of the whole land. In this, Beth-jeshimoth (the house of desolations) was situated. It was south of the acacia meadows (see note on Joshua 2:1), and it formed part of the territory of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-20.htm">Joshua 13:20</a>). As it lay upon Jordan, it must have been near the extreme northernmost point of the Dead Sea. We are to understand, not that Sihon's territory extended to Beth-jeshimoth, but in that direction. Possibly some of the western Cauaanitish tribes here extended their territories across the Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">And from the south.</span> The word here is not Negeb, but Teman, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the literal south, which lay on the right (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) to one looking eastward. <span class="cmt_word">Ashdoth-pisgah.</span> For Ashdoth see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>. Pisgah was the northernmost point of the Abarim range, of which the well known Nebo was the chief peak. Thither Moses went up to view the land which he was not permitted to enter. There Balaam built his seven altars and essayed in vain to curse the children of Israel. There were the watchmen (Zophim) stationed to protect the land, in the days before the Israelitish invasion, from the incursions of the tribes on the other side of Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-14.htm">Numbers 23:14</a>). The position of Pisgah has not been precisely identified, but the range extended on the eastern side of Jordan to a point nearly opposite Jericho. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 Fresh mercies must not drown the remembrance of former mercies, nor must the glory of the present instruments of good to the church diminish the just honour of those who went before them, since God is the same who wrought by both. Moses gave to one part of Israel a very rich and fruitful country, but it was on the outside of Jordan. Joshua gave to all Israel the holy land, within Jordan. So the law has given to some few of God's spiritual Israel worldly blessings, earnests of good things to come; but our Lord Jesus, the true Joshua, provided for all the children of promise spiritual blessings, and the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
