First he traces out the border of the trans-Jordanic possessions of Israel, which he describes as bounded on the south by the river Arnon, on the west of course by the Jordan, and as extending from Hermon, past the Sea of Chinneroth, to the borders of the Dead Sea. The eastern border is not clearly defined, but the boundary extended far further eastward in the north than in the south, since the territory of Og was much more extensive than that of Sihon. On the west of Jordan the territory is described as extending "from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Baalbec or Caesarea Philippi; see note on ch. 11:17) unto the Mount Halak which goeth up to Seir, which we have seen to be a range of mountains extending southward from near the south point of the Dead Sea. The border of the Israelitish possessions is more accurately defined in the succeeding chapters, but it was, after all, a slip of territory not more than 180 miles in length by about 100 in breadth. Its influence upon the history of the world, like that of Athens and Sparta, must not be measured by its size, but by its moral energy. As the former city has attained undying fame by its intellectual power, the second by its mihtary capacity, so Palestine has derived her title to fame from her indestructible national life - indestructible because built alone, of all the religious systems of the ancient world, upon the foundations of the unity and Fatherhood of God; indestructible, moreover, because it came by revelation from God. There is no greater argument for the Divine origin of the Mosaic law than the unique spectacle of a national life like that of the Jews, subsisting for nearly two thousand years after their expulsion from their land. <span class="cmt_word">From the river Arnon</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>). The word Arnon Signifies <span class="accented">the swift stream</span> (see Gesenius,'Thesaur.' s.v.). It is now called by the Arabs, <span class="accented">El-Mujeb</span>. Seetzen represents the region round its mouth to be naturally most fertile, but as abandoned now to a few wild plants. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Mount Hermon.</span> Now <span class="accented">Jebel-es-Sheikh</span>. We have a vivid description of the scenery of Hermon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42</a>, with the noise of its foaming torrents, the "deep calling unto deep" from the recesses of its dark ravines, where the infant Jordan rushed along its rocky bed. The Psalmist pictures to himself his troubles as overwhelming him like the billows of the numerous streams that streaked the mountain sides. And yet again Hermon is introduced as the image of peace and plenty and brotherly love. The refreshing dews which distilled from the side of the giant mountain were the source of blessing to those who dwelt afar off, and even the dry and parched sides of Mount Zion were cooled by their delicious influence. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a> the Psalmist speaks of Hermon in the plural. Some have regarded this (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Ritter) as referring to the double peak of the mountain. The phrase most probably refers to the region, though Hermon has really three peaks (see note on Joshua 11:3). <span class="cmt_word">And all the plain on the east.</span> The Arabah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>). The depression of the Jordan, which lay eastward, of course, of Palestine. This is much insisted on in the following verses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 Fresh mercies must not drown the remembrance of former mercies, nor must the glory of the present instruments of good to the church diminish the just honour of those who went before them, since God is the same who wrought by both. Moses gave to one part of Israel a very rich and fruitful country, but it was on the outside of Jordan. Joshua gave to all Israel the holy land, within Jordan. So the law has given to some few of God's spiritual Israel worldly blessings, earnests of good things to come; but our Lord Jesus, the true Joshua, provided for all the children of promise spiritual blessings, and the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
