If your tribe be as large as you say it is, it is capable of taking care of itself. There is the vast forest of Central Palestine before you. Do not complain to me, but go and take possession of it." <span class="cmt_word">Get thee up into the wood country.</span> The word "country" is not in the original, which is, strictly speaking, in the <span class="accented">direction</span> of the wood. Whether this be the "wood of Ephraim" mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6</a> has been much disputed. For not only David is related to have crossed the Jordan, but Absalom also, in hot pursuit of his father (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>). Neither army is mentioned as having recrossed the river; and it is a question whether it is more probable that there happened to be a "wood of Ephraim" on the other side of Jordan, or that Joab and Absalom, with their respective armies, recrossed Jordan without a word being said of the fact by the historian; the more especially as David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15-17, 31</a>) remained on the other side Jordan, while yet it was possible for the Ethiopian attendant, as well as Jonathan, to run to him with tidings of the defeat and death of Absalom. For the wood country in this neighbourhood cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>. Ewald would regard the language here as figurative, and the wood as referring to the powerful Phoenician tribes in the neighbourhood. He regards this answer as a sign of Joshua's "wit." But the interpretation seems far fetched and improbable. <span class="cmt_word">Cut down.</span> Or, <span class="accented">make a clearing</span>, just as emigrants do now in the primeval forest. This wood, or forest, has now disappeared, though sufficient wood still remains to testify to the correctness of, the history. <span class="cmt_word">Perizzites and of the giants.</span> The <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> (see notes on Joshua 3:10; 12:4). <span class="cmt_word">If Mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</span> This fastness in the heart of the land, the refuge of Ehud, the dwelling place of Deborah, the early home of Samuel, was well adapted to purposes of secrecy and defence, but not so well suited for a place of habitation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:14-18 Joshua, as a public person, had no more regard to his own tribe than to any other, but would govern without favour or affection; wherein he has left a good example to all in public trusts. Joshua tells them, that what was fallen to their share would be a sufficient lot for them, if they would but work and fight. Men excuse themselves from labour by any pretence; and nothing serves the purpose better than having rich and powerful relations, able to provide for them; and they are apt to desire a partial and unfaithful disposal of what is intrusted to those they think able to give such help. But there is more real kindness in pointing out the advantages within reach, and in encouraging men to make the best of them, than in granting indulgences to sloth and extravagance. True religion gives no countenance to these evils. The rule is, They shall not eat who will not work; and many of our cannots are only the language of idleness, which magnifies every difficulty and danger. This is especially the case in our spiritual work and warfare. Without Christ we can do nothing, but we are apt to sit still and attempt nothing. if we belong to Him, he will stir us up to our best endeavours, and to cry to him for help. Then our coast will be enlarged, 1Ch 4:9,10, and complainings silenced, or rather, turned into joyful thanksgivings.</body></html>
