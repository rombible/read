This has been supposed not to be the <span class="accented">tribe</span> of Asher, for this was on the north, but a city which has been identified with the modern Yasir, about five hours' distance from Nablous, or Neapolis, on the road to Beisan,or Beth-shean, where, says Delitzsch, there are "magnificent ruins" now to be seen. See, however, note ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">Michmethah</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>). This place has not been identified. All we know is that it is opposite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Shechem. Some have thought that this is simply the denominative of Asher, to distinguish it from the tribe, and that for "Asher to Michmethah" we should read "Asher-ham-Michmethah." But this could hardly be the Yasir above, since it is opposite Shechem. <span class="cmt_word">Shechem</span>. Now Nablous. This place is famous both in the Old and the New Testament. We first read of it, under the name of Sichem, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>. It was the abode of Shechem and Hamor his son, when Jacob abode in Canaan after his return from Padan-aram. It was situated between Gerizim and Ebal, and became an important city in the days of the Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>.). It was destroyed by Abimelech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-45.htm">Judges 9:45</a>), but it seems to have recovered. It was thither that Rehoboam went to be crowned, and there that his injudicious answer alienated forever the ten tribes from his rule. Jeroboam made it his capital and is said to have "built" it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>). He afterwards, however, abandoned it for Penuel, and Penuel again apparently for Tirzah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>), and Tirzah for Jezreel, which remained the capital until Omri built Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It is no doubt the Sychar mentioned in St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a>. Most travelers have admired the picturesque situation of Shechem. It has even extorted a tribute from Dr. Peterman, in his 'Reisen im Orient,' a work which, however full of valuable information regarding the condition and customs of the people, does not abound m description of scenery. He becomes almost poetical as he speaks of this town, resting on the slopes of Gerizim, a mountain fruitful to its summit, and having opposite the bare, stony el Ebal, its outline unrelieved by verdure, the haunt of jackals, whose howls, like the cry of wailing children in distress, disturb the silence of the night. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 470) thus describes the scene: "A valley green with grass, grey with olives, gardens sloping down on each side, fresh springs rushing down in all directions; at the end a white town embosomed in all this verdure lodged between the two high mountains which extend on each side of the valley; this is the aspect of Nablous, the most beautiful, perhaps it might be said the only beautiful, spot in Central Palestine. Thirty-two springs can be traced in different parts. Here the bilbul delights to sit and sing, and thousands of other birds delight to swell the chorus." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 There was great communication between Manasseh and Ephraim. Though each tribe had its inheritance, yet they should intermix one with another, to do good offices one to another, as became those, who, though of different tribes, were all one Israel, and were bound to love as brethren. But they suffered the Canaanites to live among them, against the command of God, to serve their own ends.</body></html>
