The Ephraimites and Manassites blame Joshua when they ought to be blaming themselves. They excuse themselves from a task which they are too idle to execute, and wish Joshua to make arrangements for them which are wholly unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">The hill is not enough for us.</span> Literally, the hill <span class="accented">is not found</span> for us - that is, is not sufficient (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-9.htm">Numbers 11:9</a>.2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-10.htm">Zechariah 10:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the valley of Jezreel.</span> Rather, in the valley of Jezreel. The word for valley in this verse is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> (see note on Joshua 8:13). Jezreel abutted on the great plain of Esdraelon, a name which is but a corruption of Jezreel (see note on Joshua 19:18), where the chariots of iron could be used with effect, a thing impossible in the mountain districts. Hence the fact that the hill country of Palestine was more rapidly and permanently occupied than the plains (see Ewald, 'History,' 22 C., and Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine,' 2:328. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>, and note on Joshua 11:6). Here, once more, we have a proof that we have real history before us, and not a collection of poetic myths. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:14-18 Joshua, as a public person, had no more regard to his own tribe than to any other, but would govern without favour or affection; wherein he has left a good example to all in public trusts. Joshua tells them, that what was fallen to their share would be a sufficient lot for them, if they would but work and fight. Men excuse themselves from labour by any pretence; and nothing serves the purpose better than having rich and powerful relations, able to provide for them; and they are apt to desire a partial and unfaithful disposal of what is intrusted to those they think able to give such help. But there is more real kindness in pointing out the advantages within reach, and in encouraging men to make the best of them, than in granting indulgences to sloth and extravagance. True religion gives no countenance to these evils. The rule is, They shall not eat who will not work; and many of our cannots are only the language of idleness, which magnifies every difficulty and danger. This is especially the case in our spiritual work and warfare. Without Christ we can do nothing, but we are apt to sit still and attempt nothing. if we belong to Him, he will stir us up to our best endeavours, and to cry to him for help. Then our coast will be enlarged, 1Ch 4:9,10, and complainings silenced, or rather, turned into joyful thanksgivings.</body></html>
