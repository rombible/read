They were sufficient to occupy the land of Gilead and Bashan, extensive and powerful though it was, while the rest of the tribe had a share in the inheritance westward of Jordan (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For he was the firstborn of Joseph.</span> There has been much discussion why these words were introduced. It is probable that they are intended as an explanation of the existence of Ephraim and Manasseh as separate tribes; or possibly this is introduced to suggest the reason for mentioning the tribes in this order since Ephraim was not the firstborn (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The father of Gilead.</span> There seems no reason to accept Keil's <span class="accented">dictum</span>, that because Gilead here has the article, whereas in other places where it signifies Machir's son it has not, the country and not the man is meant, and "father" must be taken as equivalent to "lord." The usage is found in Arabic and Ethiopic, but not in Hebrew. The reason why Gilead as the name of the individual has the article here is most likely because he gave his name to the territory mentioned immediately afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he had.</span> There is no "therefore" in the original, where we find "and he had." We must understand this as spoken of the tribe, not personally of Machir, who had been long dead (see note on Joshua 6:25). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 Manasseh was but half of the tribe of Joseph, yet it was divided into two parts. The daughters of Zelophehad now reaped the benefit of their pious zeal and prudent forecast. Those who take care in the wilderness of this world, to make sure to themselves a place in the inheritance of the saints in light, will have the comfort of it in the other world; while those who neglect it now, will lose it for ever. Lord, teach us here to believe and obey, and give us an inheritance among thy saints, in glory everlasting.</body></html>
