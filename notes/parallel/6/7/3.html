They thought it useless labour, and were unable to appreciate the lesson which it taught. Again our attention is directed to the peculiar character of the warfare. It was <span class= "ital">not </span>that kind of war which men would naturally have been disposed to wage. But the narrative is consistent throughout. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-1.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.">Joshua 2:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make not all the people to labour thither;</span> or, <span class="accented">weary not the people</span> with the journey <span class="accented">thither.</span> "Good successe lifts up the heart with too much confidence" (Bp. Hall). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-5 Achan took some of the spoil of Jericho. The love of the world is that root of bitterness, which of all others is most hardly rooted up. We should take heed of sin ourselves, lest by it many be defiled or disquieted, Heb 12:15; and take heed of having fellowship with sinners, lest we share their guilt. It concerns us to watch over one another to prevent sin, because others' sins may be to our damage. The easy conquest of Jericho excited contempt of the enemy, and a disposition to expect the Lord to do all for them without their using proper means. Thus men abuse the doctrines of Divine grace, and the promises of God, into excuses for their own sloth and self-indulgence. We are to work out our own salvation, though it is God that works in us. It was a dear victory to the Canaanites, whereby Israel was awakened and reformed, and reconciled to their God, and the people of Canaan hardened to their own ruin.</body></html>
