and yet utterly indomitable and unflinching in the discharge of his duty--a man of moral rather than physical courage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - And Joshua rent his clothes. A token of grief usual among the Jews (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>, 84; 44:13, etc. Knobel cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>); and though Joshua was not the high priest, yet from his peculiar position he might be expected to adopt somewhat of the high priest's demeanour, and at least not to display this outward sign of grief without the strongest reason. The words "before the ark" are omitted in the LXX. <span class="cmt_word">And put dust on their heads.</span> A sign of still more abject humiliation. The head, the noblest part of man, was thus placed beneath the dust of the ground from whence he was taken (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-32.htm">2 Samuel 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-38.htm">1 Kings 20:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>). It was a common custom among the Greeks. (See Lucian, De Luetu, 12). Homer mentions the custom (Iliad, 18). Pope's translation runs thus: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread<br />The scorching ashes o'er his graceful head.<br />His purple garments and his golden hairs,<br />Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears."<br />Lines 26-30.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:6-9 Joshua's concern for the honour of God, more than even for the fate of Israel, was the language of the Spirit of adoption. He pleaded with God. He laments their defeat, as he feared it would reflect on God's wisdom and power, his goodness and faithfulness. We cannot at any time urge a better plea than this, Lord, what wilt thou do for thy great name? Let God be glorified in all, and then welcome his whole will.</body></html>
