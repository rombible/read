"The words of the covenant, the ten commandments," are first of all a pledge that Jehovah is the God of Israel. "I am Jehovah, thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt." And He brought them out that He might bring them in--and He made them the executioners of His wrath against the idolaters. They must have no other gods but Him, and they must not treat the things that had been defiled by association with idolatry as their own spoil. The words which specially apply to this case are to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/7-25.htm" title="The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a> : "The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not <span class= "ital">desire </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm" title="When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.">Joshua 7:21</a>) the silver or gold that is on them. . . . Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be <span class= "ital">a cursed thing </span>like it."<p>The whole spoil of Canaan was not so treated; but concerning that of Jericho there had been express orders, possibly because the city was especially defiled with idolatry. God had proclaimed it abomination. It was a<span class= "ital">herem</span>--<span class= "ital">devoted </span>or <span class= "ital">accursed</span>--and no Israelite was to appropriate any of it, under penalty of becoming <span class= "ital">cherem </span>himself, and making his household <span class= "ital">cherem. </span>This Achan had done.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel hath sinned.</span> A simple but satisfactory explanation. It is not God who changes. It is we who frustrate His counsels of love and protection against our enemies. We have here another assertion of the principle that if one member suffer all the members suffer with it. Achan's sin was the sin of all Israel. So the sin of one man is still the sin of the whole Church. <span class="cmt_word">And have also stolen.</span> The accusation is cumulative. Israel, which was all involved in the sin of one among their number, had <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> broken a solemn vow; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> had stolen what was not theirs; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> had acted deceitfully (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> had appropriated to themselves what belonged to God, which, as Keil remarks, was the last and gravest feature of their crime. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is strongly brought out by the fivefold repetition of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> in the original. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-15 God awakens Joshua to inquiry, by telling him that when this accursed thing was put away, all would be well. Times of danger and trouble should be times of reformation. We should look at home, into our own hearts, into our own houses, and make diligent search to find out if there be not some accursed thing there, which God sees and abhors; some secret lust, some unlawful gain, some undue withholding from God or from others. We cannot prosper, until the accursed thing be destroyed out of our hearts, and put out of our habitations and our families, and forsaken in our lives. When the sin of sinners finds them out, God is to be acknowledged. With a certain and unerring judgment, the righteous God does and will distinguish between the innocent and the guilty; so that though the righteous are of the same tribe, and family, and household with the wicked, yet they never shall be treated as the wicked.</body></html>
