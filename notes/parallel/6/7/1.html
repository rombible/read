Hence it comes to mean to act deceitfully, or perhaps to steal (cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, a translation rendered remarkable by the fact that it is the very word used by St. Luke in regard to the transgression of Ananias and Sapphira. But the LXX. is here rather a paraphrase than a translation). It is clearly used here of some <span class="accented">secret</span> act. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a> it is used of an <span class="accented">unwitting</span> trespass, committed <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, in error of fact, but not of intention. <span class="cmt_word">Achan</span>. Called Achar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-7.htm">1 Chronicles 2:7</a>, no doubt from a reference to the results of his conduct. He had "troubled Israel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), ver. 25, and the valley which witnessed his punishment obtained the name of Achor. The copies of the LXX. vary between the two forms, the Vatican Codex having Achar; the Alexandrian, Achan. <span class="cmt_word">Zabdi</span><span class="accented">. Zimri</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>. Such variations of reading are extremely common, and are increased in our version by the varieties of English spelling adopted among our translators (see Shemuel for Samuel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>). The LXX. has <span class="accented">Zambri</span> here. <span class="cmt_word">Took of the accursed thing.</span> Commentators have largely discussed the question how the sin of Achan could be held to extend to the whole people. But it seems sufficient to reply by pointing out the organic unity of the Israelitish nation. They were then, as Christians are now, the Church of the living God. And if one single member of the community violated the laws which God imposed on them, the whole body was liable for his sin, until it had purged itself by a public act of restitution (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-1.htm">Deuteronomy 21:1-8</a>). So St. Paul regards the Corinthian Church as polluted by the presence of one single offender, until he was publicly expelled from its communion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2, 6, 7</a>). The very words "body politic" applied to a state imply the same idea - that of a connection so intimate between the members of a community that the act of one affects the whole. And if this be admitted to be the case in ordinary societies, how much more so in the people of God, who were under His special protection, and had been specially set apart to His service? In the history of Achan, moreover, we read the history of secret sin, which, though unseen by any earthly eye, does nevertheless pollute the offender, and through him the Church of God, by lowering his general standard of thought and action, enfeebling his moral sense, checking the growth of his inner and devotional life, until, by a resolute act of repentance and restitution towards God, the sin is finally acknowledged and put away. "A lewd man is a pernicious creature. That he damnes his own soule is the least part of his misehiefe; he commonly drawes vengeance upon a thousand, either by the desert of his sinne, or by the infection" (Bp. Hall). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-5 Achan took some of the spoil of Jericho. The love of the world is that root of bitterness, which of all others is most hardly rooted up. We should take heed of sin ourselves, lest by it many be defiled or disquieted, Heb 12:15; and take heed of having fellowship with sinners, lest we share their guilt. It concerns us to watch over one another to prevent sin, because others' sins may be to our damage. The easy conquest of Jericho excited contempt of the enemy, and a disposition to expect the Lord to do all for them without their using proper means. Thus men abuse the doctrines of Divine grace, and the promises of God, into excuses for their own sloth and self-indulgence. We are to work out our own salvation, though it is God that works in us. It was a dear victory to the Canaanites, whereby Israel was awakened and reformed, and reconciled to their God, and the people of Canaan hardened to their own ruin.</body></html>
