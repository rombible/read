The parallel passage--viz., the selection of King Saul from the tribes of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-20.htm" title="And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.">1Samuel 10:20-21</a>)--shows that the oracle of God was consulted. "They inquired," and "the Lord answered." So it was, perhaps, in the case of Achan. We seem to see the High Priest of Israel "asking counsel for Joshua after the judgment of Urim before the Lord," as it had been foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a>; and the elders of Israel standing by, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. The representatives of the tribes enter the sacred enclosure in succession, and pass before the High Priest, in awful silence, broken only by the voice of Jehovah, who pronounces it intervals the names of <span class= "ital">Judah, Zarhite, Zabdi, Carmi, Achan. </span>It must have been a terrible ordeal. But all present must have felt that no human partiality, or private animosity, was seeking its victim. The Judge of all the earth was doing judgment. And when the accusation of Jehovah was followed by the explicit confession of the criminal, and this again by the discovery of the stolen spoil of Jericho, which was brought in by the messengers, and "poured out before the Lord," and when this discovery was followed by the execution of the awful sentence, all who were present must have received a lesson, which it was impossible to forget, as to the reality of the covenant of God. And if, as seems most probable, the voice of the oracle was uttered from the inner sanctuary, from between the cherubim, but "heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God, when He speaketh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm" title="And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.">Ezekiel 10:5</a>), we learn once more the majesty of the law given to Israel. The arrest of Jordan, the overthrow of Jericho, and the discovery of Achan, are all manifestations of power proceeding from the same source.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Taketh</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by lot, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-42.htm">1 Samuel 14:42</a> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> make it <span class="accented">fall</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20</a>) (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-7.htm">Jonah 1:7</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-18.htm">Proverbs 18:18</a>). According to the families. The gradual centering of the suspicion upon the offender is one of the most striking features of the history. The genealogies of the children of Israel were very strictly kept, as the Books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah show. Achan's name is carefully given in the genealogy of Judah in 1 Chronicles if. 7. The subdivision of the tribes into families (or <span class="accented">clans</span>, Keil) and households (or, as we should perhaps say, <span class="accented">families</span>) was for convenience of enumeration, military organisation, and perhaps of assessment. Oehler, 'Theologie des Allen Testaments,' Sec. 101, takes the same view as Keil. The tribes, he says, were divided into <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5da;&#x5c3;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, Geschlechter (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, for which the best English equivalent is <span class="accented">clans</span>, as above); these into families or houses (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), or fathers' hours (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>); and these again into single heads of a house (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The principle, he adds of a Mosaic family, is as follows: Every <span class="accented">"family"</span> forms a distinct whole, which as far as possible must be maintained in its integrity. Each tribe, says Jahn ('Hebrew Commonwealth,' Book II.), acknowledged a prince (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) as its ruler. As its numbers increased, there arose a subdivision of the tribe into collections of families. Such a collection was called a house of fathers, a <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or clan, or a thousand, rut this explanation is not so satisfactory as that given above. Kurz remarks on the important part family life played among the Hebrews, with whom, in consequence of their descent from Abraham, and the importance they attached to it, the nation was developed out of the family. See Introduction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-15 God awakens Joshua to inquiry, by telling him that when this accursed thing was put away, all would be well. Times of danger and trouble should be times of reformation. We should look at home, into our own hearts, into our own houses, and make diligent search to find out if there be not some accursed thing there, which God sees and abhors; some secret lust, some unlawful gain, some undue withholding from God or from others. We cannot prosper, until the accursed thing be destroyed out of our hearts, and put out of our habitations and our families, and forsaken in our lives. When the sin of sinners finds them out, God is to be acknowledged. With a certain and unerring judgment, the righteous God does and will distinguish between the innocent and the guilty; so that though the righteous are of the same tribe, and family, and household with the wicked, yet they never shall be treated as the wicked.</body></html>
