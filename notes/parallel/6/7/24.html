For any other sin but this, Achan must have suffered alone. "The children shall not be put to death for the fathers." But in this case, warning had been given that the man who took of the accursed thing, or <span class= "ital">ch</span>e<span class= "ital">rern, </span>would be an accursed thing like it, if he brought it into his house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-26.htm" title="Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>), and would make the camp of Israel <span class= "ital">cherem </span>also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-18.htm" title="And you, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make yourselves accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.">Joshua 6:18</a>), and thus Achan's whole establishment was destroyed as though it had become part of Jericho. It is not necessary to assert that the family of Achan were accomplices. His cattle were not so, and yet they were destroyed. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-7.htm" title="And the sons of Carmi; Achar, the troubler of Israel, who transgressed in the thing accursed.">1Chronicles 2:7</a>, where his line is not continued. Observe also the incidental reference to the fact in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-20.htm" title="Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.">Joshua 22:20</a>, "<span class= "ital">That man perished not alone </span>in his iniquity." The severity of the punishment must be estimated by the relation of Achan's crime to the whole plan of the conquest of Canaan. If the destruction of the Canaanites was indeed the execution of the Divine vengeance, it must be kept entirely clear of all baser motives, lest men should say that Jehovah gave His people licence to deal with the Canaanites as it seemed best for themselves. The punishment of Saul for taking the spoil of Amalek (1 Samuel 15), and the repeated statement of the Book of Esther that the Jews who stood for their lives and slew their enemies, the supporters of Haman's project, <span class= "ital">laid not their hands on the prey, </span>are further illustrations of the same principle. The gratification of human passions may not be mingled with the execution of the vengeance of God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-11.htm" title="Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,">Esther 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-10.htm" title="The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.">Esther 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/esther/9-15.htm" title="For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.">Esther 9:15-16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The valley of Achor.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-7.htm" title="And the sons of Carmi; Achar, the troubler of Israel, who transgressed in the thing accursed.">1Chronicles 2:7</a>, Achan himself is designated <span class= "ital">Achar </span>(one among several examples of the alteration of a name to suit some circumstance of a person's history. Compare Bathsheba for Bathshua, Shallum for Jehoiachin, Ishbosheth for Eshbaal, &c.). There is a double play upon the names in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-15.htm" title="And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.">Hosea 2:15</a> : "I will give her her vineyards (<span class= "ital">Carmeha. </span>Compare <span class= "ital">Carmi, </span>"my vineyard") from thence, and the valley of trouble (<span class= "ital">Achor</span>) for a door of hope." The valley of Achor is a pass leading from Gilgal towards the centre of the country, or, as it might be represented, from Jericho towards Jerusalem--i.e., from the city of destruction to the city of God. So it was to Israel in the conquest. The future state of Achan is in the hands of the Judge who "doeth judgment." No mercy to his crime on earth was possible. It would have been injustice to all mankind.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Took Achan, the son of Zerah.</span> Great-grandson in reality (see ver. 1; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his sons and his daughters</span> (see note, ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Brought them</span>.

The righteous God has many ways of bringing to light the hidden works of darkness. See also, how much it is our concern, when God is contending with us, to find out the cause that troubles us. We must pray with holy Job, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. Achan's sin began in the eye. He saw these fine things, as Eve saw the forbidden fruit. See what comes of suffering the heart to walk after the eyes, and what need we have to make this covenant with our eyes, that if they wander they shall be sure to weep for it. It proceeded out of the heart. They that would be kept from sinful actions, must mortify and check in themselves sinful desires, particularly the desire of worldly wealth. Had Achan looked upon these things with an eye of faith, he would have seen they were accursed things, and would have dreaded them; but looking on them with an eye of sense only, he saw them as goodly things, and coveted them. When he had committed the sin, he tried to hide it. As soon as he had got this plunder, it became his burden, and he dared not to use his ill-gotten treasure. So differently do objects of temptation appear at a distance, to what they do when they have been gotten. See the deceitfulness of sin; that which is pleasing in the commission, is bitter in the reflection. See how they will be deceived that rob God. Sin is a very troublesome thing, not only to a sinner himself, but to all about him. The righteous God will certainly recompense tribulation to them that trouble his people. Achan perished not alone in his sin. They lose their own, who grasp at more than their own. His sons and daughters were put to death with him. It is probable that they helped to hide the things; they must have known of them. What fatal consequences follow, even in this world, to the sinner himself, and to all belonging him! One sinner destroys much good. What, then, will be the wrath to come? Let us flee from it to Christ Jesus as the sinner's Friend. There are circumstances in the confession of Achan, marking the progress of sin, from its first entrance into the heart to its being done, which may serve as the history of almost every offence against the law of God, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
