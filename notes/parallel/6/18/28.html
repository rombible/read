Almost certainly the same as "Gibeah of Saul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4</a>). It was Saul's home (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2, 15, 16</a>). It was near Saul's home, at the time his temporary refuge, that the Philistines encamped when Jonathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>.) made his daring attack on them. It was the scene of the terrible outrage recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. Lieut. Conder has identified it with Jeba, not far from Miehmash, situated on one of the branches of the precipitous Wady Suwaynit. The situation explains the otherwise unintelligible narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin.</span> Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 4.) reminds us how the very names suggest the "remarkable heights" which constitute the "table land" of which the inheritance of Benjamin consists. Thus Gibeon, Gibeah, Geba, or Gaba, all signify <span class="accented">hill.</span> Ramah signifies high place, and Mizpeh, watch tower, which of necessity must be situated on an eminence. Only by narrow passes along deep torrent beds could access be obtained to this mountainous region. Thus it was that the otherwise inexplicable resistance to all Israel in arms, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20.htm">Judges 20, 21</a>, was maintained. In a country like this the skill of the Benjamites with the sling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>) and the bow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>) could be used with terrible effect upon foes powerless to come to a hand-to-hand conflict. To Dean Stanley's vivid description of the physical geography of the country the student is referred for a detailed account. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:11-28 The boundaries of each portion were distinctly drawn, and the inheritance of each tribe settled. All contests and selfish claims were prevented by the wise appointment of God, who allotted the hill and the valley, the corn and pasture, the brooks and rivers, the towns and cities. Is the lot of any servant of Christ cast in affliction and sorrow? It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Are we in prosperity and peace? It is from above. Be humbled when you compare the gift with your own unworthiness. Forget not Him that gave the good, and always be ready to resign it at his command.</body></html>
