The inheritance of the tribe of Judah was determined in Gilgal. The assignment of the central part of the country to Ephraim and Manasseh brought the leaders of Israel into that district, and as soon as the position of Ephraim, Joshua's tribe, was settled, the tabernacle was set up there. For the situation of Shiloh, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm" title="Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.">Judges 21:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Congregation</span>. The word signifies a body of persons gathered together at a spot before indicated. The LXX. renders by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>. The idea is evidently that of an assembly gathered together for some specific acts of worship. This passage teaches the duty of a national recognition of religion. Whatever evils there might be in Israel at that time, the absence of a general and formal acknowledgment of God was not one of them. When that public acknowledgment of Him ceased, the downfall of the nation was at hand. It was the absence of such acknowledgment that was the ruin of Israel, while the hypocritical and purely external recognition of God by Judah was equally offensive in God's sight. <span class="cmt_word">Assembled</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">was summoned</span>; by whom, we are not told. But this general gathering to set up the tabernacle was at once an act of due homage to Him by whose power they had done so many great deeds, and also the establishment of a centre of national life. As long as the worship of God was maintained in its purity, the unity of Israel would be preserved, in spite of the twelve-fold division into tribes, and without the need to introduce the monarchical power. When fidelity to the outward symbol of Israelitish unity, the tabernacle at Shiloh, relaxed, then dissension and weakness crept in, and Israel became a prey to her enemies. A remarkable instance of an opposite character meets us in the history of our own country. The prey of various unconnected Teutonic tribes, the island was one vast scene of anarchy and confusion, until the great Archbishop Theodore came over and founded a National Church. It was this religious unity and cooperation which tended to harmonise the conflicting forces in the land and steadily pioneered the way to an union of the rival tribes under one head. Without attempting to say whose fault it is that this religious unity is lost, or how it may best be reestablished, it surely is the duty of every patriot and every Christian to cooperate to the best of his ability and knowledge, with all the forces that he sees tending towards unity, and both pray and labour for the coming of the day when men may once more "with one mind and with one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," and be willing to meet together "with one accord in one place." <span class="cmt_word">Shiloh</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14</a>, we find God prescribing that only in a place chosen by Himself shall the public worship of the congregation be paid to Him. Thither were all the males to resort three times a year. It is obvious how such a regulation tended to keep alive national feeling among the Israelites. The reason for the choice of Shiloh (which was probably made by Urim and Thummim, the case being important enough for such a decision) is to be found in its central position, five hours south of Shechem, and eight hours north of Jerusalem. Its situation is minutely described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>. It is difficult to understand why; since Shiloh must have been well known to all the dwellers in Israel at that time, unless it was to explain to those who were not acquainted with the localities in the tribe of Benjamin the reason for the selection of Shiloh, namely, that it lay close by the road between Bethel and Shechem (see, however, note on Joshua 24:1). The place has been identified. It is the modern Seilun, but only a few ruins remain to mark the place once so famous in the history of Israel, where Eli abode, where Samuel spent his early years. Rejected by God Himself, as the Jewish Psalmist relates with patriotic pride (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60, 67-69</a>), it fell into utter neglect, and even in the days of Jeremiah it seems to have become a by word (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6, 9</a>. Also Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper, Jan., 1873, where an account, with a plan, is given of the place in its present condition. There are a few rock-hewn tombs there). Whether it was named Shiloh on account of the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, it is impossible to say. The name appears to signify <span class="accented">rest</span>, and was an appropriate name to be given to the visible symbol of rest from warfare which Joshua had obtained for Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-4.htm">Joshua 22:4</a>). The difficult passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> is not of course included in this interpretation of the meaning of the word Shiloh. <span class="cmt_word">Congregation</span> The word here differs slightly from the word translated "congregation" in the first part of the verse, but it comes from the same root. <span class="cmt_word">And the land was subdued before them.</span> That is, the land in which the tabernacle was set up. We know from the next verse that the land as a whole was not subdued. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1 Shiloh was in the lot of Ephraim, the tribe to which Joshua belonged, and it was proper that the tabernacle should be near the residence of the chief governor. The name of this city is the same as that by which Jacob prophesied of the Messiah, Ge 49:10. It is supposed by some that the city was thus called, when it was chosen for the resting-place of the ark, which typified our great Peace-maker, and the way by him to a reconciled God.</body></html>
