No wiser method could have been devised to secure an united Israel than thus to make Benjamin the link between the two most powerful and naturally rival tribes. In the story of Joseph, the brethren are reconciled through the mutual affection of Judah and Joseph for Benjamin as their father's youngest and best-loved son.<p>The position thus given to Benjamin under Joshua was still further developed by circumstances. The tribe was almost exterminated in the time of the judges; the survivors were united in marriage with women of Ephraim and Manasseh (?). On the other hand, the city of Jerusalem, although assigned by Joshua to Benjamin, was first a joint possession of Judah and Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-28.htm" title="These were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief men. These dwelled in Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-32.htm" title="And Mikloth begat Shimeah. And these also dwelled with their brothers in Jerusalem, over against them.">1Chronicles 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm" title="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Judges 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.">Judges 1:21</a>), then the royal city of the kings of the house of Judah. The selection of the first king of Israel from Benjamin, and the ultimate planting of the religious and political centre of all the tribes on the confines of Judah and Benjamin in Jerusalem, would have been two masterstrokes of policy if they had been schemes of man's devising. They were really links in the long chain of God's providential dealing with the chosen people.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">And their border.</span>--This is first described on the north side, where it coincided with the southern border of Ephraim.

Benjamin.</span>--The following are identified: viz., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm" title="Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,">Joshua 18:21</a>, <span class= "ital">'Ain-es-Sultan,' Ain Hajlah </span>(sheet 18); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-22.htm" title="And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,">Joshua 18:22</a>, <span class= "ital">Khurbet es-S�mnrah, Beitin </span>(sheet 18); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm" title="And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,">Joshua 18:23</a>, <span class= "ital">Fatah </span>(sheet 18), <span class= "ital">Taiyibeh </span>(sheet 14); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm" title="And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:">Joshua 18:24</a>, <span class= "ital">Jeb 'a </span>(sheet 17).<p>(22) <span class= "bld">Beth-el</span> seems to have passed into the hands of Ephraim without question when the tribe of Benjamin was all but exterminated. In the division of the kingdoms, though the tribe of Benjamin followed the house of Judah, the town of Bethel was regarded as part of the kingdom of Israel, and Jeroboam's southern boundary. He set up two golden calves, one in Bethel and the other in Dan, at the northern and southern extremities of his kingdom.<p>(25) <span class= "ital">El-Jeb, Er-Ram, Bireh </span>(all in sheet 17).<p>(26) S<span class= "ital">h'afat, Kejireh, Beit Mizzeh </span>(Kefireh, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Kefriyeh, sheet 14); the others are in sheet 17<p>(27) <span class= "ital">Rafat </span>(sheet 17).<p>(28) <span class= "ital">Lifta, El-Kuds, Jebi'a, Kuriet-el-' anab </span>(all in sheet 17).<p>(28) <span class= "bld">Jebusi, which is Jerusalem.</span>--When "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killed the prophets, and stoned them that were sent unto her," was called to account for "all the righteous blood shed upon the earth," <span class= "ital">the cup was found in Benjamin's sack, </span>having been put there, as we see, by Joshua, the steward (after Moses) of the true Joseph's house. (See <span class= "ital">Names on the Gates of Pearl--</span>Benjamin, p. 191.) Jerusalem is always thought of as the capital of Judah. Probably few readers of the Bible would answer, if asked for its position, that it was originally a Benjamite city. And we may add that no later writer than Joshua would be likely to have placed it in the territory of Benjamin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Benjamin.</span> Lying as their inheritance did between that of Ephraim and Judah, the chief places of note on their border have been already mentioned either in ch. 15. or in ch. 16. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:11-28 The boundaries of each portion were distinctly drawn, and the inheritance of each tribe settled. All contests and selfish claims were prevented by the wise appointment of God, who allotted the hill and the valley, the corn and pasture, the brooks and rivers, the towns and cities. Is the lot of any servant of Christ cast in affliction and sorrow? It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Are we in prosperity and peace? It is from above. Be humbled when you compare the gift with your own unworthiness. Forget not Him that gave the good, and always be ready to resign it at his command.</body></html>
