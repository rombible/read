The ark of this covenant had brought them over Jordan into the promised land.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood.</span>--The flood, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the river--probably Euphrates, though it may be Jordan, or both. Flood in our English Bible has been used for river in several places: <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-16.htm" title="Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood:">Job 22:16</a>, "whose foundation was overflown with a <span class= "ital">flood," i.e., </span>a river; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm" title="He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.">Psalm 66:6</a>, "He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the <span class= "ital">flood </span>(the river, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Jordan) on foot;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-25.htm" title="And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell not: for it was founded on a rock.">Matthew 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-27.htm" title="And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.">Matthew 7:27</a>, "The rain descended, and the <span class= "ital">floods </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the <span class= "ital">rivers</span>) came."<p><span class= "bld">They served other gods.</span>--They, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Terah, Abraham, and Nachor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Shechem.</span> The LXX. and the Arabic version read <span class="accented">Shiloh</span> here, and as the words "they presented themselves (literally, <span class="accented">took up their station</span>) before God" follow, this would seem the natural reading. But there is not the slightest MSS. authority for the reading, and it is contrary to all sound principles of criticism to resort to arbitrary emendations of the text. Besides, the LXX. itself reads <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;</span>, in ver. 26, and adds, "before the tabernacle of the God of Israel," words implied, but not expressed in the Hebrew. We are therefore driven to the supposition that this gathering was one yet more solemn than the one described in the previous chapter. The tabernacle was no doubt removed on this great occasion to Shechem. The locality, as Poole reminds us, was well calculated to inspire the Israelites with the deepest feelings. It was the scene of God's first covenant with Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6, 7</a>), and of the formal renewal of the covenant related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2-4</a> (see note on vers. 23, 26), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a>, when the blessings and the curses were inscribed on Mount Gerizim and Ebal, and the place where Joseph's bones (ver. 32) were laid, possibly at this time, or if not, at the time when the blessings and curses were inscribed. And now, once again, a formal renewal of the covenant was demanded from Israel by their aged chieftain, before his voice should cease to be heard among them any more. Rosenmuller reminds us that Josephus, the Chaldee and Syriac translators, and the Aldine and Complutensian editions of the LXX. itself, have Sichem. Bishop Horsley makes the very reasonable suggestion that Shiloh was not as yet the name of a town, but possibly of the tabernacle itself, or the district in which it had been pitched. And he adds that Mizpeh and Sheehem, not Shiloh, appear to have been the places fixed upon for the gathering of the tribes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a> (cf. ver. 27); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>). See, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-12.htm">Judges 21:12</a>, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-12.htm">Joshua 22:12</a>. Some additional probability is given to this view by the fact noticed above, that it is thought necessary to describe the situation of Shiloh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>, and we may also fail to notice that the words translated "house of God" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18, 26</a> in our version, is in reality Bethel, there being no "house of God" properly so called, but only the "tabernacle of the congregation." The tabernacle in that ease would be moved from place to place within the central district assigned to it, as necessity or convenience dictated. Hengstenberg objects to the idea that the tabernacle was moved to Shechem that it would have led to an idea that God was only present in His Holy Place, to which it is sufficient to <span class="accented">reply</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that this does not necessarily follow, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that such a conception was entertained, though erroneously, by some minds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Samaritan woman, for instance, supposed the Jews to believe that in Jerusalem only ought men to worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>). When Hengstenberg says, however, that the meeting in the last chapter had reference to Israel from a theocratic and religious, and this one from an historical point of view, he is on firmer ground. The former exhortation is ethical, this historical. He goes on to refer to the deeply interesting historical traditions centering round this place, which have been noticed above. The oak in ver. 26, Hengstenberg maintains to be the same tree that is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> (where our version has, erroneously, "plain"), and which is referred to both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a> and here <span class="accented">as the</span> (<span class="accented">i.e</span>, the well known) terebinth in Shechem (see note on ver. 26). He has overlooked the fact that the tree in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> is not an <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> but an <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. He goes on to contend that the terebinth was not merely "by" but "in" the sanctuary of the Lord, which he supposes to be another sanctuary beside the tabernacle, perhaps the sacred enclosure round Abraham's altar. But he is wrong, as has been shown below, (ver. 26), when he says that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> never signifies near (see Joshua 5:25). The question is one of much difficulty, and cannot be satisfactorily settled. But we may dismiss without fear, in the light of the narative in ch. 22, Knobel's suggestion that an altar was erected here on this occasion. If there were any altar, it must have been the altar in the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Other gods.</span> That the family of Nahor were not exactly worshippers of the one true God in the same pure ritual as Abraham, may be gathered from the fact that Laban had teraphim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19, 30</a>). But recent researches have thrown some light on the condition of Abraham's family and ancestors. If Ur Casdim be identified, as recent discoverers have supposed, with Mugeyer, which, though west of Euphrates as a whole, is yet to the eastward of one of its subordinate channels (see 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arebaeology,' 3:229; Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p. 4), its ruins give us plentiful information concerning the creed of its inhabitants. We may also find some information about this primeval city in Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:15, and in Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' p. 233. The principal building of this city is the temple of the moon god Ur. One of the liturgical hymns to this moon god is in existence, and has been translated into French by M. Lenormant. In it the moon is addressed as Father, earth enlightening god, primeval seer, giver of life, king of kings, and the like. The sun and stars seem also to have been objects of worship, and a highly developed polytheistic system seems to have culminated in the horrible custom of human sacrifices. This was a recognised practice among the early Accadians, a Turanian race which preceded the Semitic in these regions. A fragment of an early Accadian hymn has been preserved, in which the words "his offspring for his life he gave" occur, and it seems that the Semitic people of Ur adopted it from them. A similar view is attributed to Balak in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5, 6</a>, and was probably derived from documents which have since perished (see Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p 24). Hence, no doubt the Moloch, or Molech, worship which was common in the neighbourhood of Palestine, and which the descendants of Abraham on their first entrance thither rejected with such disgust (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, where Abraham seems to have some difficulties connected with his ancestral creed). Other deities were worshipped in the Ur of the Chaldees. Sumas, the sun god, Nana, the equivalent of Astarte, the daughter of the moon god, Bel and Belat, "his lady." "In truth," says Mr. Tomkins, in the work above cited, "polytheism was stamped on the earth in temples and towers, and the warlike and beneficent works of kings. Rimmon was the patron of the all-important irrigation, Sin of brickmaking and building, Nergal of war." A full account of these deities will be found in Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 We must never think our work for God done, till our life is done. If he lengthen out our days beyond what we expected, like those of Joshua, it is because he has some further service for us to do. He who aims at the same mind which was in Christ Jesus, will glory in bearing the last testimony to his Saviour's goodness, and in telling to all around, the obligations with which the unmerited goodness of God has bound him. The assembly came together in a solemn religious manner. Joshua spake to them in God's name, and as from him. His sermon consists of doctrine and application. The doctrinal part is a history of the great things God had done for his people, and for their fathers before them. The application of this history of God's mercies to them, is an exhortation to fear and serve God, in gratitude for his favour, and that it might be continued.</body></html>
