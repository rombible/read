Ye cannot serve the Lord: for he is . . . jealous . . .</span>--Jehovah will not consent to be served as one God among many: the very thing which Israel was doing at the moment, which they meant to do, and did do, with rare intervals, down to the Babylonish captivity, when the evil spirit of (literal) idolatry was expelled for evermore. Israel always maintained the worship of Jehovah (except in <span class= "ital">very evil </span>times) as the national Deity, but did not abstain from the recognition and partial worship of other national deities of whom they were afraid, and whom they thought it necessary to propitiate. Therefore Joshua's argument is perfectly intelligible, and was entirely necessary for those times.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord.</span> Calvin thinks that Joshua said this to rouse the sluggish heart of the people to some sense of their duty. But this is quite contrary to the fact, for the heart of the people, as we have seen (ch. 22.), was <span class="accented">not</span> sluggish. As little can we accept the explanation of Michaelis, who paraphrases, "Ye will not be able, from merely human resolutions, to serve God." Joshua was stating nothing but a plain fact, which his own higher conception of the law had taught him, that the law was too "holy, just, and good" for it to be possible that Israel should keep it. He had forebodings of coming failure, when he looked on one side at the law with its stern morality and rigorous provisions, and the undisciplined, untamed people that he saw around him. True and faithful to the last, he set before them the law in all its majesty and fulness, the nature of its requirements, and the unsuspected dangers that lay in their weak and wayward hearts. No doubt he had a dim presentiment of the truth, to teach which, to St. Paul, required a miracle and three years' wrestling in Arabia, that by the deeds of the law "shall no flesh be justified in God's sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). As yet the Spirit of God had barely begun to unveil the figure of the Deliverer who was to declare at once God's righteousness and His forgiveness. Yet none the less did Joshua do his duty, and strove to brace up the Israelites to theirs, not by disguising the nature of the undertaking to which they were pledging themselves, but by causing them to be penetrated with a sense of its awfulness and of the solemn responsibilities which it entailed. St. Augustine thinks that Joshua detected in the Israelites already the signs of that self righteousness which St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>) blames, and that he wished to make them conscious of it. But this is hardly borne out by the narrative. <span class="cmt_word">He is a holy God.</span> The <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> is used here in the case of the adjective as well as the substantive. This is to enhance the idea of the holiness which is an essential attribute of God. <span class="cmt_word">He is a Jealous God.</span> The meaning is that God will not permit others to share the affections or rights which are His due alone. The word, which, as its root, "to be red," shows, was first applied to human affections, is yet transferred to God, since we can but approximate to His attributes by ideas derived from human relations. Not that God stoops to the meanness and unreasonableness of human jealousy. His vindication of His rights is no other than reasonable in Him. "His glory" He not only "will not," but cannot "give to another." And therefore, as a jealous man does, yet without his infirmity, God refuses to allow another to share in what is due to Himself alone. The word, as well as the existence of the Mosaic covenant, has no doubt led the prophets to use, as they do on innumerable occasions, the figure of a husband and wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-25.htm">Ezekiel 23:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2, 13, 16</a> (margin), Hosea 2:19, 20) in describing the relations of God to His Church, and approximate to His attitude towards His people by the illustration of an injured husband towards a faithless wife (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>). There were many words used for "forgive" in Scripture: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5e4;&#x5e8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> (see Pearson's learned note in his 'Treatise on the Creed,' Art. 10). The one here used signifies to remove or to bear the burden of guilt, corresponding to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> in the New Testament. The word here translated" transgressions" is not the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>, and the cognate word to the one rendered "transgressed" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11</a>, is here rendered "sins." It signifies a "breach of covenant," while the word translated" sins" is the equivalent of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-28 It is essential that the service of God's people be performed with a willing mind. For LOVE is the only genuine principle whence all acceptable service of God can spring. The Father seeks only such to worship him, as worship him in spirit and in truth. The carnal mind of man is enmity against God, therefore, is not capable of such spiritual worship. Hence the necessity of being born again. But numbers rest in mere forms, as tasks imposed upon them. Joshua puts them to their choice; but not as if it were indifferent whether they served God or not. Choose you whom ye will serve, now the matter is laid plainly before you. He resolves to do this, whatever others did. Those that are bound for heaven, must be willing to swim against the stream. They must not do as the most do, but as the best do. And no one can behave himself as he ought in any station, who does not deeply consider his religious duties in family relations. The Israelites agree with Joshua, being influenced by the example of a man who had been so great a blessing to them; We also will serve the Lord. See how much good great men do, by their influence, if zealous in religion. Joshua brings them to express full purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord. They must come off from all confidence in their own sufficiency, else their purposes would be in vain. The service of God being made their deliberate choice, Joshua binds them to it by a solemn covenant. He set up a monument of it. In this affecting manner Joshua took his last leave of them; if they perished, their blood would be upon their own heads. Though the house of God, the Lord's table, and even the walls and trees before which we have uttered our solemn purposes of serving him, would bear witness against us if we deny him, yet we may trust in him, that he will put his fear into our hearts, that we shall not depart from him. God alone can give grace, yet he blesses our endeavours to engage men to his service.</body></html>
