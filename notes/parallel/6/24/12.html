The mention of hornets in the prophecies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-28.htm">Exodus 23:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-20.htm">Deuteronomy 7:20</a> is not conclusive. In the former passage the hornet seems to be connected with the fear that was to be felt at their advance. The latter passage is not conclusive on either side. The probability is - since we have no mention of hornets in the history - that what is meant is that kind of unreasonable and panic fear which seems, to persons too far off to discern the assailants, to be displayed by persons attacked by these apparently insignificant insects. The image is a lively and natural one, and it well expresses the dismay which, as we read, seized the inhabitants of the land when their foes, formidable rather from Divine protection then from their number or warlike equipments, had crossed the Jordan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>). Where the figure came from is not far to seek. Joshua was quoting the prophecies of Moses mentioned above. <span class="cmt_word">The two kings of the Amorites.</span> Sihon and Og, who were driven out, beside the tribes on the other side Jordan who have just been mentioned. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 We must never think our work for God done, till our life is done. If he lengthen out our days beyond what we expected, like those of Joshua, it is because he has some further service for us to do. He who aims at the same mind which was in Christ Jesus, will glory in bearing the last testimony to his Saviour's goodness, and in telling to all around, the obligations with which the unmerited goodness of God has bound him. The assembly came together in a solemn religious manner. Joshua spake to them in God's name, and as from him. His sermon consists of doctrine and application. The doctrinal part is a history of the great things God had done for his people, and for their fathers before them. The application of this history of God's mercies to them, is an exhortation to fear and serve God, in gratitude for his favour, and that it might be continued.</body></html>
