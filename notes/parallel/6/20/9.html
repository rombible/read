Or, <span class="accented">of refuge or resort.</span> Our version has followed the LXX. and Vulgate here. Greek, <span class="accented">unawares</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">in error</span> or <span class="accented">inadvertently</span>, as above. Matthew Henry's note on the cities of refuge is worthy of remark. He says, "I delight not in quibbling on names, yet am willing to take notice of these." Thus Kedesh, he reminds us, is <span class="accented">holy.</span> Shechem, <span class="accented">a shoulder</span>, reminding us of Him upon whose shoulder the government was to be. Hebron is fellowship, recalling the fellowship we have in Christ. Bezer is a <span class="accented">fortification</span>, reminding us of God our stronghold (later criticism, however, gives another derivation to this unusual word, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24, 25</a>, means the ore of a precious metal), Ramoth is height or exaltation, and to such exaltation we are called in Jesus Christ. Lastly, Golan is exultation, so says Matthew Henry, deriving it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>. But Gesenius derives it with equal probability from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> "to make bare," hence to lead into captivity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:7-9 These cities, as those also on the other side Jordan, stood so that a man might in half a day reach one of them from any part of the country. God is ever a Refuge at hand. They were all Levites' cities. It was kindness to the poor fugitive, that when he might not go up to the house of the Lord, yet he had the servants of God with him, to instruct him, and pray for him, and to help to make up the want of public ordinances. Some observe a significance in the names of these cities with application to Christ our Refuge. Kedesh signifies holy, and our Refuge is the holy Jesus. Shechem, a shoulder, and the government is upon his shoulder. Hebron, fellowship, and believers are called into the fellowship of Christ Jesus our Lord. Bezer, a fortification, for he is a strong hold to all those that trust in him. Ramoth, high or exalted, for Him hath God exalted with his own right hand. Golan, joy or exultation, for in Him all the saints are justified, and shall glory.</body></html>
