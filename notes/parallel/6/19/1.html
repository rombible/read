(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-3.htm" title="And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.">Judges 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-17.htm" title="And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.">Judges 1:17</a>.) In this fact a prophecy was fulfilled; for the effect of the allotment was to separate Simeon from the tribes with whom he had been united in the journey through the wilderness (viz., Reuben and Gad), who had cast off Simeon, and united themselves with the half tribe of Manasseh instead. Being also separated from Levi, Simeon was still further isolated: with the result that in the final separation of Israel and Judah, after Solomon's death, the tribe of Simeon, though adhering to the kingdom of the ten tribes (for the children of Simeon were counted <span class= "ital">strangers </span>in Judah--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2Chronicles 15:9</a>), was separated from the territory of that kingdom by the whole breadth of the kingdom of Judah. Thus were Jacob's words brought to pass, which he spoke on his death-bed regarding Simeon and Levi: <span class= "ital">I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</span><p>(2) <span class= "bld">Beer-sheba.</span>--<span class= "ital">Bir-es-seba. </span>Sheba (Shema).<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Ain, Remmon.</span>--<span class= "ital">Timm er-Rumamin.</span><p>The rest of the cities of Simeon are not identified in Conder's Biblical Gazetteer, with the exception of Sharuhen (<span class= "ital">Tell esh-Sheri'ah, </span>north-west of Beer-sheba).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">The part of the children of Judah was too much for them.</span>--In Judges 1 we read that Judah invoked the assistance of Simeon to complete the conquest of his inheritance, and also assisted Simeon to conquer his. This fact illustrates the character of the conquest of Canaan by Joshua, and shows that when his work was done, something was still left for the individual tribes to do.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in the midst of.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">in medio</span>, Vulgate (cf. ver. 9). Simeon, at the last census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>), was the smallest of the tribes of Israel, a fulfilment of the prophecy of Jacob, and possibly the result of the command given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, since the Simeonites were the chief offenders on that occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>). The distribution of territory was in accordance with this, and it is possible that the lot only determined the priority of choice among the tribes. The territory of Judah seems to have been recognised as too large, in spite of the importance of the tribe. They therefore willingly gave up a portion of their territory to the Simeonites. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-9 The men of Judah did not oppose taking away the cities within their border, when convinced that they had more than was right. If a true believer has obtained an unintended and improper advantage in any thing, he will give it up without murmuring. Love seeketh not her own, and doth not behave unseemly; it will induce those in whom it richly dwells, to part with their own to supply what is lacking to their brethren.</body></html>
