A locality well known in Scripture, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a> onwards. <span class="cmt_word">And Sheba.</span> Some would translate here, <span class="accented">or</span> Sheba (see below). No doubt the city, of which nothing further is known, derived its name from Beer-sheba, "the well of the oath," close by. It is true that some little difficulty is caused by the omission of this city in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-28.htm">1 Chronicles 4:28</a>, by the identification of Shehah with Beer-sheba in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-33.htm">Genesis 26:33</a>, and by the fact that in ver. 6 we are told that there were thirteen cities in this catalogue, whereas there are fourteen. On the other hand, Keil has remarked that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a> the number of names does not correspond to the whole number of cities given; and we have a Shema, probably a mistake for Sheba, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-26.htm">Joshua 15:26</a>, mentioned before Moladah among the cities of Judah. And, lastly, we have very few instances in Scripture of the disjunctive use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>, though it seems impossible to deny that it is used in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-9 The men of Judah did not oppose taking away the cities within their border, when convinced that they had more than was right. If a true believer has obtained an unintended and improper advantage in any thing, he will give it up without murmuring. Love seeketh not her own, and doth not behave unseemly; it will induce those in whom it richly dwells, to part with their own to supply what is lacking to their brethren.</body></html>
