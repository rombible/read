and it seems better to translate literally: <span class= "ital">And the coast of the children of Dan went out from them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>their territory was partly re-conquered by the Philistines. Something similar seems to have occurred in several districts of the country. The Israelites not taking advantage of the impression produced by Joshua's great victories to occupy the territory assigned to them, the nations of Canaan re-possessed themselves of their former abodes. and held them against Israel. The Philistines are expressly said to have been left to prove Israel. Joshua was not permitted to exterminate them. And although Dan and Judah, numerically the two strongest of all the tribes (both in the census in the plains of Moab and at Sinai), were placed next to the Philistines, and had the task of conquering that nation assigned to them, still it was not effected. We read in Judges 1, <span class= "ital">"</span>The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not suffer them to come down into the valley."<p>Hence the Danites, instead of attacking the Philistines and Amorites in their inheritance, preferred to form a new settlement in the north, and put to the sword "a people quiet and secure," who "had no deliverer," rather than "run with patience the race set before them." They were not minded to resist unto blood, striving against their foes. (See the narrative in Judges 18, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/19-27.htm" title="And turns toward the sun rise to Bethdagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,">Joshua 19:27-28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went out too little for them.</span> The Hebrew is, went out <span class="accented">from them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, either went out beyond their own borders, or went out too small a distance to be sufficient for them. The first is the explanation of Masius ("extra se migrasse"), the second of Jarchi. Houbigant suggests for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span> "and it went out" <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;</span> "and it was narrow." But the LXX, has the same reading as ourselves, and the explanation given above is quite consistent with the fact. The border of Dan did "go out" far beyond the borders originally assigned to the tribe, in fact to the extreme northern limit of Palestine. The account of the taking of Laish, or Leshem, is given more fully in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>. The inheritance assigned to Dan was extremely small, but it was also extremely fertile. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:17-51 Joshua waited till all the tribes were settled, before he asked any provision for himself. He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.</body></html>
