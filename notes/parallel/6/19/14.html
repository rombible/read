The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e1;&#x5d1;</span> is here used transitively. The meaning is that the border makes a curve round the city of Neah. Neah seems to have been the extreme eastern border. Methoar is supposed to be the Pual participle, and has been freely translated, "which is marked out," or, "which belongs to," Neah. But the passage is obscure. Knobel could alter the reading, in view of the grammatical difficulty. Yet this, perhaps, is not insuperable in view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14</a> (see Gesen, 'Grammar,' sec. 108, 2. c.). <span class="cmt_word">Valley</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>.
