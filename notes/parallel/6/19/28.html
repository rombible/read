Rather, Ebron. It is not the same word as the Hebron in Judah, but is spelt with Ain instead of Hheth. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-30.htm">Joshua 21:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-59.htm">1 Chronicles 6:59</a>, Abdon is the name of the city assigned to the Levites in Asher. Twenty MSS., says Keil, have the same reading here. But the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> here and <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-30.htm">Joshua 21:30</a>. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;</span> are so much alike that there is no doubt that the mistake has arisen earlier than the time when that translation was made. It is true that the lists of Levitical cities in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>. do not entirely correspond. But the resemblance here between the names is too striking to allow of the supposition that two different cities are meant. Great Zidon. This city, as well as Tyro, remained unsubdued, although assigned by Joshua to Asher. The boundary of Asher appears to have been traced first towards the west, then eastward, from a middle point on the southern border (see note on ver. 11), then to have been carried northward from the same point (the <span class="accented">left hand</span> usually means the north; see note on Teman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a>), on the east side till it reached Cabul. Then the northern border is traced westward to Sidon. Then the border turned southward along the sea, which is not mentioned, because it would seem to be sufficiently defined by the mention of Ramah and Tyre. Between Hosah and Achzib there would seem to have been a greater paucity of cities, and therefore the sea is mentioned. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:17-51 Joshua waited till all the tribes were settled, before he asked any provision for himself. He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.</body></html>
