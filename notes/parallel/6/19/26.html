Literally, <span class="accented">toucheth, i.e. skirteth</span>, as in vers. 11 and 22. So in the next verse, with regard to Zebulun. The term appears to be the invariable one when a district, not a particular place, is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">To Carmel westward.</span> The Carmel range appears to have been included in the tribe of Asher. For we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10, 11</a>) that Asher met Manasseh on the north, whence we conclude that it must have cut off Issachar from the sea, and that as Dor was among the towns which Manasseh held within the territory of Issachar and Asher, it must therefore have been within the boundaries of the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Shihor-libnath.</span> For Shihor see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>. Libnath, which signifies white or shining, has been supposed by some to mean <span class="accented">the glassy river</span>, from its calm, unbroken flow, though this appears improbable, since Shihor means turbid. It is far more probable that the current was rendered turbid by a quantity of chalk or limestone which it carried along in its course, and hence the name "muddy white." Keil thinks it to be the Nahr-el-Zerka, or crocodile river, of Pliny, in which Beland, Von Raumer, Knobel, and Rosenmuller agree with him. But when he proceeds to argue that this river, being blue, "might answer both to <span class="accented">shihor</span>, black, and <span class="accented">libnath</span>, white," he takes a flight in which it is impossible to follow him. Gesenius, from the glazed appearance of burnt brick or tiles (<span class="accented">l'banah</span>), conjectures,that it may be the Belus, or "glass river," so called, however, in ancient times because the fine sand on its banks enabled the manufacture of glass to be carried on here. But this, emptying itself into the sea near Acre, has been thought to be too far north. Vandevelde, however, one of the latest authorities, as well as Mr. Conder, is inclined to agree with Gesenius. The difficulty of this identification consists in the fact that <span class="accented">Carmel</span> and <span class="accented">Dor</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>) are said to have been in Asher (see note on Joshua 17:10). The Nahr-el-Zerka has not been found by recent explorers to contain crocodiles, but it has been thought possible that they have hitherto eluded observation. Kenrick, however ('Phoenicia,' p. 24), thinks that as <span class="accented">crocodilus</span> originally meant a lizard, the <span class="accented">lacertus Niloticus</span> is meant, the river being, in his opinion, too shallow in summa to be the haunt of the crocodile proper (see also Tristram, 'Land of Israel.' p. 103, who believes it possible that the crocodile may be found there, though no specimen has as yet been produced). The Zerkais described in Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Paper, January, 1874, as "a torpid stream flowing through fetid marshes, in which reeds, canes, and the stunted papyrus grow." When it is added, "and where alone in Palestine the crocodile is found," no evidence is given in favour of the statement. It empties itself into the sea between Dor and Caesarea, a few miles north of the latter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:17-51 Joshua waited till all the tribes were settled, before he asked any provision for himself. He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.</body></html>
