<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-39.htm">1 Kings 7:39</a>, margin). Thus Jerusalem lay to the north of the border, in the tribe of Benjamin. <span class="cmt_word">The same is Jerusalem.</span> Formerly called Jebus, from the Jebusites who dwelt there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-11.htm">Judges 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4</a>). The city lay on the borders of Judah and Benjamin (see note on Joshua 10:1). <span class="cmt_word">The valley of the giants.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>). The word here translated valley is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>. In the former part it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (see note on last verse). The word here used signifies originally <span class="accented">depth</span>, and is applied to wide valleys embosomed among lofty hills. Such were the valley of Elah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2, 19</a>); the King's Dale (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>); the valley of Siddim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>), of Jezreel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a>). "The word Emek shows that this was neither a winter torrent nor a narrow, dry ravine, and it is best identified with its traditional site, the shallow basin west of the watershed south of Jerusalem, now called el Bukei'a" (Conder). We read of this valley in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18, 22</a>. From these passages we may gather a confirmation of the view above expressed, that the valley here meant is an open valley, since only in such a valley could the Philistine army take up a position. It gradually narrows towards the southwest. On the south it extends as far as Bethlehem. The range of mountains which lie to the west of the valley of Hinnom from the northern boundary of the plain or valley of Rephaim. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-12 Joshua allotted to Judah, Ephraim, and the half of Manasseh, their inheritances before they left Gilgal. Afterwards removing to Shiloh, another survey was made, and the other tribes had their portion assigned. In due time all God's people are settled.</body></html>
