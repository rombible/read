This was the fertile part of Judah, and formed a part of the rich plain which has been described as extending northward as far as Carmel. It was "renowned for the beauty of its flowers" (Delitzsch). With the exception of Zorah and Eshtaol, border towns to the tribe of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>), famous in the history of Samson (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13.htm">Judges 13-16</a>.), and mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>, the cities remarkable in history have been noticed already. It is worthy of remark that the cities of the Philistines were included in this list. But the Philistines, save during the reigns of David and Solomon, retained their independence, and in earlier and later times alike even encroached upon the Jewish territory (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>; and note on ver. 11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:20-63 Here is a list of the cities of Judah. But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.</body></html>
