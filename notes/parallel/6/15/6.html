It is still known as <span class="accented">Ain Hadjla</span> or <span class="accented">Hajla</span>, where, says Keil, a beautiful spring of fresh and clear water is to be found. The place lies about two miles from Jordan. Beth-hogla means "the house of the partridge." "Leaving the probable site of the ancient Gilgal and advancing southward along the pilgrims' route to the Jordan, an hour and a quarter brings us to the spring Kin Hajla, in a small and well-watered grove" (Ritter). He adds, "Robinson and Wilson both recognised in the name Hails the ancient Canaanitish city Beth-hogla." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-arabah.</span> Or "the house of the Arabah" or desert. Its site is not known (see ver. 61 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18, 22</a>).

Of Bohan nothing further is known.
