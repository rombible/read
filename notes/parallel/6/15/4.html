"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth" was the instruction to Joshua, and in describing the border of Judah, he is really describing also the southern border of all Israel; and he does it throughout in language very like that of Moses in Numbers 34. But Moses wrote it in the second person and in the future tense throughout; Joshua wrote it in the third person and in the past tense, with this one exception, in which he seems to have unconsciously adopted the phraseology of the lawgiver instead of the historian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The river of Egypt</span> (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>).

The historian here quotes the directions given to Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a>, with the evident intention of pointing out that the south border of the children of Israel coincided with that of the tribe of Judah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-12 Joshua allotted to Judah, Ephraim, and the half of Manasseh, their inheritances before they left Gilgal.
