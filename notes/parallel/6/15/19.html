The word Negeb signifies dry (see note on Negeb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>). It must be remembered that it became the word for south, because the south of Palestine was an arid tract. Therefore Achsah must be understood as saying, "Thou hast given me a dry country, give me also a reservoir of water." The Vulgate translates Negeb twice over, "australem et arentem" (arentem only <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>). The LXX. translates both Negeb and Gulloth as proper names.

The Chaldee renders <span class="accented">the house of irrigation</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>). Knobel translates <span class="accented">reservoirs. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The upper springs and the lower springs</span> (see note on Debit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-38.htm">Joshua 10:38</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:13-19 Achsah obtained some land by Caleb's free grant. He gave her a south land. Land indeed, but a south land, dry and apt to be parched. She obtained more, on her request, and he gave the upper and the nether springs. Those who understand it but of one field, watered both with the rain of heaven, and the springs that issued out of the earth, countenance the allusion commonly made to this, when we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls, as blessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body and the life that now is, as blessings of the nether springs. All the blessings, both of the upper and the nether springs, belong to the children of God. As related to Christ, they have them freely given of the Father, for the lot of their inheritance.</body></html>
