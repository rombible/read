Or, deflected (see ver. 4). This is in accordance with the view taken above. The border line which had run northwest from Jerusalem now bent backwards in a southwesterly direction, and followed the ridge towards Chesalon (see note on Chesalon). Mount Seir. Not the dwelling place of Esau, afterwards the country of the Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>), but a range running southwestward from Kirjath-jearim, part of which is still known as Sairah, or Saris, "auf welchem <span class="accented">Saris</span> und <span class="accented">Mihsir</span> liegen" (Kuobel). Since Kirjath-jearim means the "city of the forests," and Seir means "hairy," we may conjecture that the name was given to the ridge on account of its wooded character. This also is implied by "Mount Jearim." <span class="cmt_word">The side of Mount Jearim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">the shoulder</span> (see above, ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Which is Chesalon.</span> This is identified with <span class="accented">Kesia</span>, a point on the summit of the ridge stretching southwest from Kirjath-jearim. The fact that the border passed northward of Chesalon is a confirmation of the view taken above. We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a> (cf. ver. 33 of this chapter), that the border passed by Zorah and Eshtaol in the Shephelah, through a neighbourhood described in Conder's Handbook as "an open corn country." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shemesh.</span> The "house of the sun," identified with the modern Ain (or fountain of) Shems. It is called Irshemesh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>. It was close to the border of the Philistines, and was the scene of the transactions recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a>. The propinquity to the Philistines appears to have affected the principles of its inhabitants, and their conduct contrasts most unfavourably with that of the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim. This was the more disgraceful, in that Beth-shemesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>) was a priestly city, and being inhabited by those whose "lips should keep knowledge," might have been expected to set a better example. It was required to furnish Solomon's household with provisions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-9.htm">1 Kings 4:9</a>), it witnessed the defeat and capture of Amaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a>) by Joash, king of Israel. It fell into the hands of the Philistines at the time of the decay of the Jewish power under Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). The name, like Baal-Gad and Ashtaroth-Karnaim, is worthy of remark, as pointing to the character of the early Phoenician worship. <span class="cmt_word">Timnah.</span> Sometimes called Timnath in Scripture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1-6</a>), and Timnatha in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-43.htm">Joshua 19:43</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-12 Joshua allotted to Judah, Ephraim, and the half of Manasseh, their inheritances before they left Gilgal. Afterwards removing to Shiloh, another survey was made, and the other tribes had their portion assigned. In due time all God's people are settled.</body></html>
