Rather, <span class="accented">border</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> note ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Southward</span>. The term here used (see above, ver. 19) for "south" is the one which has the signification of dryness. It is, however, occasionally used in a less strict sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24</a>. Though the south country was in the main an arid region, yet its intersection by numerous wadys, with their attendant streams, provided fertile spots at intervals, where the traveller might rest, cattle might be watered, and corn and other produce raised. The only places of any importance in Scripture history mentioned here are Beersheba (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>), and Hormah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>). This last passage explains why the city is mentioned among the cities of Simeon as well as Judah, and is another instance of the remarkable accuracy of our author. Ziklag is famous as the residence of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). It is noteworthy that t was given to him by Achish, king of Gath, in whose possession it therefore was at that time. It was burnt by the roving hands of Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:20-63 Here is a list of the cities of Judah. But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.</body></html>
