Which is its original place? In Judges it is connected with the continuation of the conquest of Canaan by the tribe of Judah <span class= "ital">after Joshua's death, </span>and there we read they slew (literally, <span class= "ital">smote</span>) Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. If this is the death, and not merely the defeat of the Anakim (the Hebrew word is not absolutely decisive), we have two stages in the conquest of Hebron described--viz., (l) the expulsion of the Anakim sufficiently for Caleb to occupy the place; and (2) their final defeat and death. It seems hardly possible to make the narrative in Judges 1 a mere repetition of an earlier story, because it is presented as a part of that which happened after Joshua's death. It would seem, then, that the entire conquest of the Anakim was not effected at once, but begun by Caleb and Joshua in Joshua's lifetime, and completed by the tribe of Judah, under the leadership of Caleb, after Joshua's death. It is remarkable that Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai are mentioned as apparently living when the twelve spies went up from Kadesh-barnea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-22.htm" title="And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)">Numbers 13:22</a>), forty years before. But it has been thought that the three names were the names of three clans of the Anakim. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Judges 1:10</a>.)<p>Upon the whole, it seems most reasonable to conclude that the proceedings by which Caleb secured his inheritance, and fulfilled the promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm" title="Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.">Joshua 14:12</a>, have been recorded here for the sake of completeness, though not necessarily belonging to this time.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Kirjath-sepher.</span>--"City of books."<p>(17) <span class= "bld">Othniel the son of Kenaz.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">A south land</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>land in the <span class= "ital">Negeb: </span>"a series of rolling hills clad with scanty herbage here and there."

It has been argued from the variations that the one passage was not copied from the other, but that both were derived from a common document. No such conclusion, however, can be safely drawn from the text. For first, the present narrative deals exclusively with this portion of the history of Caleb. That in Judges, down to ver. 12, deals more generally with the subject, including the exploits of Caleb, under the general history of the progress of Judah. But from the time that the history becomes that of Caleb in particular, the agreement between the two narratives is verbal, including the very unusual word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;</span>, with one or two most insignificant exceptions. Thus we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> interpolated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>, and Othniel (or Kenez) is spoken of as the <span class="accented">younger</span> brother of Caleb. But unless we hold that it was a sacred duty of the writer in Judges to reproduce every single word of the narrative in Joshua, there is nothing whatever that can support the conclusion that the writer in Judges was not copying the earlier narrative. The variations are such as would naturally happen where a writer was transferring, a narrative to his pages with a desire to give the exact sense of the original without tying himself to every particular word. Since the use of inverted commas has been introduced we can find multitudes of instances where a writer, when professing to quote another accurately, has introduced far more variations into his quotation than are to be found here, where the writer, though quoting the Book of Joshua, and quoting it correctly, does not say that he is doing so. No one doubts that Jeremiah in ch. 48. is quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>, although the passages are not verbally coincident. We may safely regard this quotation of the Book of Joshua in that of Judges, as under all ordinary laws of criticism an evidence that the former book was in existence when the latter was written, just as the quotations of Deuteronomy in Joshua may naturally be taken as evidence that the Book of Deuteronomy was in existence when that of Joshua was composed. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Jephunneh.</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A part.</span> Literally, a <span class="accented">lot. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Among</span>.

Keil thinks that he was the tribe father, or chief (sheikh, as the Arabs would call him), of the children of Anak. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:13-19 Achsah obtained some land by Caleb's free grant. He gave her a south land. Land indeed, but a south land, dry and apt to be parched. She obtained more, on her request, and he gave the upper and the nether springs. Those who understand it but of one field, watered both with the rain of heaven, and the springs that issued out of the earth, countenance the allusion commonly made to this, when we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls, as blessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body and the life that now is, as blessings of the nether springs. All the blessings, both of the upper and the nether springs, belong to the children of God. As related to Christ, they have them freely given of the Father, for the lot of their inheritance.</body></html>
