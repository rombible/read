With it compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3-5</a>, which gives the southern border of the Israelitish territory, corresponding closely with this account of the southern border of Judah. The word <span class="accented">tribe</span> here is, as might be expected from the context <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Even to the border of Edom.</span> The literal translation, which makes the passage clearer, is, "the border of Edom, the wilderness of Zin towards the dry region (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) from the extreme limit of the south <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>.

The former word has reference to the physical conditions of the country, its heat and dryness.

This wilderness was on the border of Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>). Thence the border of Judah (which here includes the small portion afterwards allotted to Simeon) extended to the utmost limits of the south (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>). A wall of mountains extends southwestward from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and formed the natural boundary of Judaea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-12 Joshua allotted to Judah, Ephraim, and the half of Manasseh, their inheritances before they left Gilgal. Afterwards removing to Shiloh, another survey was made, and the other tribes had their portion assigned. In due time all God's people are settled.</body></html>
