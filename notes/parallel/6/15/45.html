These cities of the Philistines had, like Gibeon, daughter cities dependent on them, and must therefore have been, like Gibeon, "great cities as the royal cities" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). They do not appear to have come under regal government till later times (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8, 11</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). "Around it (Gezer) and along the sides were distributed a series of small isolated centres of agglomeration .... This disposition to scatter itself, of which Gezer surely does not offer us the only specimen, explains in a striking manner the Biblical phrase, 'the city and her daughters'" (Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper, Jan., 1874). This explanation, however, is doubtful (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>). According to Knobel, this passage cannot have been written by the Elohist, because he confines himself to the description of the cities the Israelites actually possessed. Why a lair writer, writing presumably when Israel's fortunes were at a lower ebb, should have added a description of the territory Israel <span class="accented">did not</span> possess, he does not explain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:20-63 Here is a list of the cities of Judah. But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.</body></html>
