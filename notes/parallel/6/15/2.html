Although the points mentioned along the border are not all certainly known, there is no doubt that the great mountain wall which extends from the Dead Sea to the water-shed south of Rehoboth (<span class= "ital">Er-Ruheibeh</span>) formed the natural and recognised boundary of Palestine, while the river of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-4.htm" title="From there it passed toward Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.">Joshua 15:4</a>) is generally supposed to be the present <span class= "ital">Wady-el'-Arish, </span>the northern boundary between Syria and Egypt. The north branch of this valley ( <span class= "ital">Wady-el-Abiad</span>) rises near 'Abdeh (<span class= "ital">Ebodah</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>south of Rehoboth, and thus carries on the boundary from the mountain rampart.

It is called the Lisan. Whoever was the writer of the Book of Joshua, these details prove him to have had an accurate acquaintance with the geography of Palestine. He was no priestly inventor of fables attached to the temple at Jerusalem. Canon Tristram gives a vivid description of the neighbourhood in his 'Land of Israel,' ch. 15. The ridge of Jebel Usdum - one large mass of rock salt - on the west of this "tongue" of water, the salt marsh of the Sebkha on the southwest, with its treeless waste - "not a plant or a leaf could be seen save just under the hills" - and its mirage like that of Sahara, the barren outline of the Lisan itself, to the eastward rising to an elevation of from five to six hundred feet, and the fertile oasis of the Ghor-es-Safieh at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, give an unique character to this remarkable region. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-12 Joshua allotted to Judah, Ephraim, and the half of Manasseh, their inheritances before they left Gilgal.
