The western cairn was in Gilgal, the other on the opposite side, at the edge of the overflow, where the priests had stopped. The only difficulty lies in the words above cited, <span class= "ital">in the midst of Jordan. </span>The phrase, like many other Hebrew phrases, is used in a different way from that in which we should use it. The words "in the middle of the Jordan" to an English reader appear to mean half-way between the banks. But if the river were divided, and half of it had recoiled many miles towards the north, and the rest flowed away to the south, any one standing between these two parts of the river might be said to stand <span class= "ital">in the midst of Jordan, </span>the two parts being on either side; and he would be equally in the midst, <span class= "ital">as regards them, </span>whether he were at the edge of the stream or not. It is contrary to common-sense, as well as to the words of the text, to suppose that a cairn was set up in the midst of the river's bed. "They are there unto this day," the writer adds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-9.htm" title="And Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.">Joshua 4:9</a>. It is perfectly clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-8.htm" title="And you shall command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, you shall stand still in Jordan.">Joshua 3:8</a> that the priests stood at the brim of the overflow. That spot and no other would be the particular spot which it would be most interesting to mark, the place from which Jordan, in full flood, was driven back.<p>Further, the words "in the midst" (Hebrew, <span class= "ital">Vtholc</span>) do not necessarily mean more than <span class= "ital">within. </span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.">Joshua 19:1</a>, it is said the inheritance of Simeon was <span class= "ital">within </span>(<span class= "ital">b'thok</span>) the inheritance of the children of Judah. Yet it was entirely on one edge of it. May not the ark standing in the midst of Jordan represent that suspension of the power of death which is effected by the interposition of our Saviour, and fills the interval between the reign of death "from Adam to Moses," and the "second death" that is to come?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stood firm.</span> Much discussion has taken place about the proper rendering of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> which the LXX. translates <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">durissimos.</span> It seems best to take it, as our version does, as the infinitive absolute, and to translate as in ch.
