Here the word used is <span class="accented">horn of jubilee</span>, but not necessarily of <span class="accented">ram's</span> horn, as our version, any more than the modern <span class="accented">horn</span>, though it takes the place of the more primitive instrument made of that material, must itself be a ram's horn. So Rosenmuller. The word. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> in Hebrew is used in different senses, all, however, growing out of the one original sense. Thus it is used for a <span class="accented">musical instrument</span>, for <span class="accented">rays of light</span>, for the <span class="accented">projections extending from the corners of the altar</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>, for a <span class="accented">mountain peak</span> (like the German Schreekhorn, Gabelhorn, Weisshorn). Origen compares the blast of the trumpet at which the walls of Jericho fell, to the sound of the last trumpet, which shall finally destroy the kingdoms of sin. <span class="cmt_word">When ye hear.</span> The Keri substitute here, as in many other places, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> but unnecessarily. The Keri means <span class="accented">at the very moment when</span>, the Chethibh simply and less emphatically, <span class="accented">"when"</span> (see ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Flat</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">underneath it, i.e.</span>, the walls were to give way from their very foundations. <span class="cmt_word">Every man straight before him.</span> There was no need to <span class="accented">surround</span> the city, nor to endeavour to enter it through a "practicable breach." The walls were to give way entirely, and the warriors might advance at once, in the order of battle, and from the place in which they were at the moment when they raised the shout of triumph (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) for the inhabitants of Jericho alone were evidently no match for them in numbers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1-3</a>), though they might have hoped to hold out some time under the protection of their walls. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 Jericho resolves Israel shall not be its master. It shut itself up, being strongly fortified both by art and nature. Thus were they foolish, and their hearts hardened to their destruction; the miserable case of all that strengthen themselves against the Almighty. God resolves Israel shall be its master, and that quickly. No warlike preparations were to be made. By the uncommon method of besieging the city, the Lord honoured the ark, as the symbol of his presence, and showed that all the victories were from him. The faith and patience of the people were proved and increased.</body></html>
