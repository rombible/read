(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-26.htm" title="Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>.) The combination of the two ideas of devotion to God and utter destruction may be seen in the sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-25.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.">Leviticus 6:25</a>), which is called "holy of holies," or most holy, and yet, when offered for the priest or congregation, must be utterly consumed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word"> Accursed.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">devotea</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> LXX. The original meaning of this word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5dd;</span> to "shut up." Hence it originally means "a net." With this we may compare the well known Eastern word <span class="accented">harem</span>, meaning the enclosed apartments reserved for the women of the family. Hence it comes to mean <span class="accented">under a ban, devoted</span>, generally to utter destruction under the pressure of a vow to God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2</a>, or in consequence of His command (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-15.htm">Deuteronomy 13:15</a> (Hebrew 16); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>, "the man of my <span class="accented">devoting,"</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, etc). But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-14.htm">Numbers 18:14</a>, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5de;</span> as devoted to the Lord, became the property of the priest. This ban was the most solemn and tremendous religious sentence, the absolute and final excommunication of the old law. The sin of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.) was the sparing of anything whatever in the city which had been laid under the ban - a ban which Saul had been specially commanded to execute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>) according to the principles laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>. When Keil, however, states that the ban "could never be pronounced upon things and property alone, but only upon open idolaters, either with or without their possessions," he appears to have overlooked <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-16.htm">Leviticus 27:16-21</a>, where a man may devote irredeemably to God property of <span class="accented">his own</span> (cf. ver. 28 of the same chapter). In his subsequent work, however, Keil qualifies this assertion by a consideration of this very passage. Idolatrous worship was the one thing which justified the Israelites in laying one of their own cities under the ban (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12</a> 18, above cited). But (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>) it had been pronounced against the Canaanites. Property, how. ever, save in the case of Jericho, seems to have been exempted from the ban (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>). Even at Jericho the silver and the gold, the brass and the iron, were placed in the treasury of the Lord (Joshua 5:19, 24). "Why," says Theodoret, "was the city thus devoted? It was devoted on the same principle which offered the first fruits to God, since it was the first fruits of their conquests." Because she hid. See for the peculiar form of this word as though it came from a quadriliteral <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:17-27 Jericho was to be a solemn and awful sacrifice to the justice of God, upon those who had filled up the measure of their sins. So He appoints, from whom, as creatures, they received their lives, and to whom, as sinners, they had forfeited them. Rahab perished not with them that believed not, Heb 11:31. All her kindred were saved with her; thus faith in Christ brings salvation to the house, Ac 14:31. She, and they with her, were plucked as brands from the burning. With Rahab, or with the men of Jericho; our portion must be assigned, as we posses or disregard the sign of salvation; even faith in Christ, which worketh by love. Let us remember what depends upon our choice, and let us choose accordingly. God shows the weight of a Divine curse; where it rests there is no getting from under it; for it brings ruin without remedy.</body></html>
