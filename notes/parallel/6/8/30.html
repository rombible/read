It is a note of time. Josephus places this transaction later. The LXX. places <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:">Joshua 8:1-2</a> of Joshua 9 before this passage. But there seems no reason for moving the transaction from the place where we find it in the text. By the capture of Ai, Joshua had obtained command over the road to Shechem. We hear of no strong place north of Beth-el in that part of the country. From other passages (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-18.htm" title="But the mountain shall be yours; for it is a wood, and you shall cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be yours: for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.">Joshua 17:18</a>) there seems reason to think that a large part of this district was wooded and uncleared. The confederacy of the southern kings had its centre far to the south of this, and there was a considerable distance between Shechem and the strong places to the north. It is in keeping with what we have already observed regarding the purpose of the conquest of Canaan, that the law of the God of Israel should be as soon as possible proclaimed and set up in the heart of the country, to be thenceforward the law of the land. For the enactment that was here carried out, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/11-26.htm" title="Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;">Deuteronomy 11:26-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-2.htm" title="And it shall be on the day when you shall pass over Jordan to the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set you up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:">Deuteronomy 27:2</a>, &c. Observe also that the command there given required the work to be done as soon after the passing of Jordan as possible. The possibility of reading the law from this position, so as to be heard by the whole congregation, has been proved by actual experiment.<p>(30, 31) <span class= "bld">An altar . . . in mount Ebal . . .</span>--This was explicitly commanded in Deuteronomy. The blessing was put on mount Gerizim, the altar and the curse on mount Ebal. We do not hear elsewhere of any sacrifice on Ebal. But it is certain that God accepted sacrifices in many places in Canaan. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-24.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Away, get you down, and you shall come up, you, and Aaron with you: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth on them.">Exodus 19:24</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal.</span> This passage has been pronounced to be an interpolation by Meyer, De Wette, Maurer, Rosenmuller, Knobel, and others. The LXX. does not introduce it here, but after <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-2.htm">Joshua 9:2</a>. For other authorities see below. It is very easy to see why its genuineness has been disputed. The Book of Joshua has many marks of having been written not so very long after the events described in it. But it has been a favourite opinion with the school which disputes the authenticity of the books of the Bible, that Deuteronomy was a late revision by Ezra of the law of Moses, though this (see Introduction) has lately been discarded for another hypothesis. But we have, if the present passage be genuine, a distinct proof that the Book of Joshua was written after the Book of Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy is here quoted as the "book of the law of Moses" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9, 24, 26</a>). The grounds on which the genuine. ness of the passage has been denied are these: First, the passage begins with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;</span> followed by an imperfect, or future, as does the interpolated passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-41.htm">Deuteronomy 4:41-43</a>. This is Maurer's theory. But in this case we must reject every passage which begins thus, and certainly we should do so on grounds which, to say the least, are very slender. Next, we are told that Joshua could not have ventured to trust himself so far in the heart of a hostile country. But why not? Gerizim was not more than twenty miles from Ai. The Canaanites, we are told, were panic stricken at Joshua's success. The Gibeonites were not disposed to offer any hindrance to his progress; on the contrary, they hastened to form an alliance with him. And these solemn religious rites, performed by a people so clearly under the protection of the Most High, were more likely to increase than lessen the awe felt by the surrounding tribes. The only difficulty is that the women and children (v. 35) are expressly said to have gone thither also, and it seems improbable that they, whom we have supposed to have been left under a guard at Gilgal, should have been brought so far while the country was as yet unsubdued. And the difficulty is increased by finding Joshua again at Gilgal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>. But there is the hypothesis that this was another Gilgal to fall back upon, and this (see note on the passage just mentioned) is an extremely probable one. The suggestion of many commentators, that the passage has been transposed, is of course possible. We can only leave the difficulty unsolved, as one which a fuller knowledge of the facts, could we obtain it, would clear up at once. But we may be sure that if the passage were an interpolation, some explanation would have been given of the circumstances which seem to us so perplexing. And on the other hand we must remember that, as has been already contended, the notion that the whole camp of Israel performed this journey at a time when stupefaction had seized upon the Canaanitish tribes, though involving some amount of impossibility, is by no means impossible. (See also note on ver. 33). A number of extraordinary interpretations of this passage have been given. A favourite Rabbinical interpretation (see note on next verse) was that this altar was erected on the very day on which the Israelites crossed the Jordan. This was of course a physical impossibility. Josephus, on the contrary, supposes that five years elapsed before its erection, while Rabbi Israel, in the Jerusalem Talmud, thinks that it was deferred until after the expiration of fourteen years, and after the land had been divided. So Masius <span class="accented">in loc.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In Mount Ebal.</span> Between it and Gerizim stood the city of Shechem, or Sychar, as it is called in St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a>. Gerizim was close to this city, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 7</a> and St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a> testify, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>. Dr. Maclear, in the 'Cambridge Bible for Schools,' suggests that the Israelites took this opportunity of interring the bones of Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25, 26</a>) in the piece of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>). (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:30-35 As soon as Joshua got to the mountains Ebal and Gerizim, without delay, and without caring for the unsettled state of Israel, or their enemies, he confirmed the covenant of the Lord with his people, as appointed, De 11; 27. We must not think to defer covenanting with God till we are settled in the world; nor must any business put us from minding and pursuing the one thing needful. The way to prosper is to begin with God, Mt 6:33. They built an altar, and offered sacrifice to God, in token of their dedicating themselves to God, as living sacrifices to his honour, in and by a Mediator. By Christ's sacrifice of himself for us, we have peace with God. It is a great mercy to any people to have the law of God in writing, and it is fit that the written law should be in a known tongue, that it may be seen and read of all men.</body></html>
