The Vulgate translates the last clause of the verse, "Praesertim cum hi, qui simulaverint fugam... fortissime restitissent." They could not flee back to the city, for it was in flames. They could not advance northward, because the Israelites had faced about and were coming to meet them. To flee in any other direction would be to cut off the last hope of saving the city. For <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> in the sense of <span class="accented">side</span> or <span class="accented">direction</span>, however, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-5.htm">Exodus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-37.htm">Deuteronomy 2:37</a>, and especially the dual, as here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-21.htm">Genesis 34:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:3-22 Observe Joshua's conduct and prudence. Those that would maintain their spiritual conflicts must not love their ease. Probably he went into the valley alone, to pray to God for a blessing, and he did not seek in vain. He never drew back till the work was done. Those that have stretched out their hands against their spiritual enemies, must never draw them back.</body></html>
