In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-9.htm" title="Have not I commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be you dismayed: for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.">Joshua 1:9</a>, "For the Lord thy God is with thee." These words indicate the return of Jehovah to the host of Israel, for the prosecution of the war.<p><span class= "bld">Take all the people.</span>--Not merely "two or three thousand," as before.<p><span class= "bld">Ai.</span>--In Hebrew, <span class= "ital">Ha-ai. </span>Ai is intended for one syllable, not two as often sounded in English. It means "the heap" (of ruins apparently). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-28.htm" title="And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation to this day.">Joshua 8:28</a> we read that Joshua made it "an heap for ever" (<span class= "ital">Tel-olam </span>in Hebrew). Thus its first and last names agree. It is remarked that whereas Palestine is full of "Tels" with other names appended to them (as Tell-es Sultan, and some ten others near Jericho alone), the place called et-Tel by Bethel has no other appendage. It is not the heap of anything, but simply <span class= "ital">the heap, </span>to this day; and this fact, which is apparently without parallel, seems to fix the site of Ai at <span class= "ital">et-Tel. </span>(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.">Joshua 7:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And his land.</span>--The capture of Ai was not simply the capture of a town or fortress, but of the chief town of a territory, the extent of which we are not told. If we knew the circumstances of the time more precisely, we might apprehend the strategical reasons which made it desirable to obtain possession of Ai in particular at this stage of the campaign.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fear not.</span> Joshua was down cast at his former failure, and well he might. "Treacherous Israelites are to be dreaded more than malicious Canaanites" (Matthew Henry). <span class="cmt_word">Take all the people of wax with thee.</span> Not, as has been before stated, because 3,000 men were too few to take the city, for the capture of Jericho was a far greater marvel than that of Ai with this number of men. The true reason is indicated by Calvin, and is indeed suggested by the words "Fear not, neither be thou dismayed." It was to reassure the people, whose hearts had "melted and become as water." Sometimes God calls upon His people for a display of faith, as when He led them through the Jordan, or commanded them to compass Jericho seven days. But in days of despondency He compassionates their weakness and permits them to rely upon visible means of support (see also below, ver. 3). Matthew Henry thinks that a tacit rebuke is here administered to Joshua for sending so few men to Ai on the frowner occasion. He ought to have permitted all to have shared the toil and glory. <span class="cmt_word">I have given into thy hand.</span> The work, let man do his best, is God's after all. <span class="cmt_word">The king.</span> For the political condition of Palestine before the Israelitish invasion see Introduction. <span class="cmt_word">And his land.</span> As in the case of the early Germanic peoples, there was a certain portion of their land in the neigbourhood attached to each city which was used for agricultural purposes (see Introduction; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1,2 When we have faithfully put away sin, that accursed thing which separates between us and God, then, and not till then, we may look to hear from God to our comfort; and God's directing us how to go on in our Christian work and warfare, is a good evidence of his being reconciled to us. God encouraged Joshua to proceed. At Ai the spoil was not to be destroyed as at Jericho, therefore there was no danger of the people's committing such a trespass. Achan, who caught at forbidden spoil, lost that, and life, and all; but the rest of the people, who kept themselves from the accursed thing, were quickly rewarded for their obedience. The way to have the comfort of what God allows us, is, to keep from what he forbids us. No man shall lose by self-denial.</body></html>
