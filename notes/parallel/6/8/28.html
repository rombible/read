The word in ver. 19 (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;</span>) has rather the sense of kindling a fire; the word here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5ea;</span>), more the sense of destruction by fire. <span class="cmt_word">A heap forever.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> a heap of eternity; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a heap forever, at least up to the time of our writer. But the Ai mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a> may have been a city built, not on precisely the same spot, but near enough to it to take its name. And if Ai signifies ruins, and Dean Stanley be right in regarding it as referring to ruins in the days of the Philistines, the name would be particularly suitable to this particular city. Travellers have identified the place with Tel-el. Hajar, immediately to the south of the Wady Mutyah. But see note on ch. 7:2 for Robinson's conclusion, which is confirmed by Canon Tristram, from the belief that Tel-el-Hajar does not answer to the description of Ai in the Scripture narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Hanged on a tree.</span> Literally, "on the tree." Perhaps after his death, But see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-22.htm">Genesis 40:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Until eventide.</span> We find here a remarkable coincidence with the precept in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>. The fact that no notice is here taken of that passage is conclusive against its having been inserted with a view to that precept in later times, and this affords a strong presumption against the Elohist and Jehovist theory. <span class="cmt_word">Heap.</span> Here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, an expression usually applied to a heap of stones, a <span class="accented">cairn</span>, though not always in precisely this sense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 8:30-35. THE COPY OF THE LAW. - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:23-29 God, the righteous Judge, had sentenced the Canaanites for their wickedness; the Israelites only executed his doom. None of their conduct can be drawn into an example for others. Especial reason no doubt there was for this severity to the king of Ai; it is likely he had been notoriously wicked and vile, and a blasphemer of the God of Israel.</body></html>
