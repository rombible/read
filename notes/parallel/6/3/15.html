But this rendering is contrary <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the Hebrew, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> contrary to fact. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The literal rendering here is, "filleth <span class="accented">out</span> (or <span class="accented">upon</span>) all its banks." In ch. 4:18 we read that Jordan goeth <span class="accented">over</span> all its banks And that the Jordan is not merely full, but full to overflowing, at the harvest season, is proved by the statements of many travellers. Take, for instance, Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 223), who describes his visit to the Jordan as occurring just after it had been overflowing its banks, and the lower level of the valley as filled with "a deep slimy ooze." He adds that, by measure merit, the river was found to have been fourteen feet above the level at which he found it, and it was then quite full. Bartlett ('From Egypt to Palestine,' p. 451) remarks, "We were fortunate enough to see it in the state in which it is described in Joshua, 'overflowing all its banks' - that is, the whole line of its banks. The turbid stream rushed along like a mill race, and though it had fallen from its greatest height, the proper banks of the channel were invisible, and indicated only by lines of oleanders and other shrubs and trees." This was on the 22nd of March. This overflowing is caused by the melting of the snows of Hermon, which then rush down, fill Lake Huleh and its marshes, as well as Gennesareth, and cause the "swelling of Jordan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; 1:44), which drives the wild beasts from their retreats on its banks (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-15.htm">1 Chronicles 12:15</a>). Some travellers have boldly asserted, in spite of this concurrent testimony, that Jordan does not overflow its banks at the time of harvest. But they have mistaken the wheat for the barley harvest, forgetting that in Palestine the latter precedes the former by six or seven weeks. By the time of wheat harvest Jordan has returned to its normal condition, and all traces of the inundation have passed away (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' pp. 618-621). <span class="cmt_word">The time of harvest,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the barley harvest, which took place about the 10th Nisan, or Abib, when the Israelites crossed. The wheat harvest was about Pentecost, or seven weeks later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>). An important argument for the genuineness of the narrative (and much the more important as its chief incident is miraculous) is drawn from this passage by Blunt in his 'Undesigned Coincidences.' He remarks that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 33</a> the barley and flax are said to have ripened together. Therefore the time of the barley and flax harvest would be identical. Accordingly we have Rahab, three days before the event here recorded, in possession of the as yet undried stalks of flax which had just been cut. Nothing could be a more satisfactory proof that the narrative we have before us comes from persons who were accurately and minutely informed concerning the circumstances of which they tell us. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-17 Jordan overflowed all its banks. This magnified the power of God, and his kindness to Israel. Although those who oppose the salvation of God's people have all advantages, yet God can and will conquer. This passage over Jordan, as an entrance to Canaan, after their long, weary wanderings in the wilderness, shadowed out the believer's passage through death to heaven, after he has finished his wanderings in this sinful world. Jesus, typified by the ark, hath gone before, and he crossed the river when it most flooded the country around. Let us treasure up experiences of His faithful and tender care, that they may help our faith and hope in the last conflict.</body></html>
