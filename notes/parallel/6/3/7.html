The details that follow in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-15.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,">Joshua 4:15</a>, &c., seem to be added by way of appendix. The passage of Jordan, being the principal event, is exhibited by itself; and other particulars of attendant circumstances are given separately. A somewhat similar plan appears to be adopted in Joshua 10, but the arrangement of both narratives is at first sight somewhat complex, and not quite clear.<p>It is here stated that the passage of Jordan was to be to Joshua what the giving of the law at Sinai was to Moses, "that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.">Exodus 19:9</a>). But the power which establishes Joshua is the work of the <span class= "ital">written </span>instead of the <span class= "ital">spoken </span>word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This day will I begin to magnify thee.</span> "Neque enim ante mysterium baptismi exal-tatur Jesus, sed exaltatio ejus, et exaltatio in conspectu pepuli, inde sunlit exordium" (Orig., Hem. 4 on Joshua. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 The waters of Jordan shall be cut off. This must be done in such a way as never was done, but in the dividing of the Red sea. That miracle is here repeated; God has the same power to finish the salvation of his people, as to begin it; the WORD of the Lord was as truly with Joshua as with Moses. God's appearances for his people ought to encourage faith and hope. God's work is perfect, he will keep his people. Jordan's flood cannot keep out Israel, Canaan's force cannot turn them out again.</body></html>
