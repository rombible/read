The LXX. does not translate this. The Vulgate renders <span class="accented">accincti.</span> The original, literally translated, means <span class="accented">to cause to stand upright. <span class="cmt_word"></span>In the midst of Jordan.</span> That is, they stood surrounded by water, but not in midstream, which would be expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> as in ver. 10, where our version has "among" (see note on Joshua 4:9). So Drusius: "In medio Jordanis; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, intra Jordanem. Sic Tyrus legitur sita <span class="accented">in corde maris</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, intra mare nam non procul abest a continente." <span class="cmt_word">Clean over.</span> The word is the same as that translated "failed" in the last note. It means <span class="accented">completion</span> - "till the people had entirely finished crossing." Origen thus explains, in his fourth homily on Joshua, the mystical signification of this crossing the Jordan: "Cure catechumenorum aggregatus es numero, et praeceptis Ecclesiasticis parere coepisti digressus es mare rubrum, et in deserti stationibus positus, ad audiendam Dei legem, et intuendum Mosei vulture per gloriam Domini revelatum quotidie vacas. Si vero ad mysticum baptismi veneris fontem, et consistente sacerdotali et Levitico ordine initiatus fueris venerandis illis magnificisque sacramentis quae norunt illi quos nosse fas est, hanc etiam sacerdotum ministeriis Jordane digresso terram repromissionis intratis, in qua te post Moysen suscipi Jesus, et ipse tibi efficitur novi itineris dux." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-17 Jordan overflowed all its banks. This magnified the power of God, and his kindness to Israel. Although those who oppose the salvation of God's people have all advantages, yet God can and will conquer. This passage over Jordan, as an entrance to Canaan, after their long, weary wanderings in the wilderness, shadowed out the believer's passage through death to heaven, after he has finished his wanderings in this sinful world. Jesus, typified by the ark, hath gone before, and he crossed the river when it most flooded the country around. Let us treasure up experiences of His faithful and tender care, that they may help our faith and hope in the last conflict.</body></html>
