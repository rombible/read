<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-12.htm">1 Chronicles 15:12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-11.htm">2 Chronicles 5:11</a>; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4</a>. It is also connected with purification, but ironically, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow.</span> These words were uttered while all was in preparation. We learn from ver. 7, though it is not expressly stated, that the actual crossing took place the next day. We ought, probably, to place this verse in a parenthesis, and to translate "Joshua had said," because the sanctification (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10, 14</a>) involved some definite period. Knobel, however, assumes, as usual, that there is at least a faulty arrangement here. <span class="cmt_word">Wonders,</span> or rather, <span class="accented">miracles</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> to <span class="accented">separate, distinguish.</span> They were, therefore, acts distinguished from the ordinary course of God's providence. We may observe that, while among the Canaanites all was terror and confusion, m the camp of Joshua all was confidence and faith. "Either successe or discomfiture begins ever at the heart. A man's inward disposition doth more than presage the event. If Satan see us once faint, he gives himselfe the day. There is no way to safety, but that our hearts be the last that shall yield" (Bp. Hall). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The Israelites came to Jordan in faith, having been told that they should pass it. In the way of duty, let us proceed as far as we can, and depend on the Lord. Joshua led them. Particular notice is taken of his early rising, as afterwards upon other occasions, which shows how little he sought his own ease. Those who would bring great things to pass, must rise early. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty. All in public stations should always attend to the duty of their place. The people were to follow the ark. Thus must we walk after the rule of the word, and the direction of the Spirit, in everything; so shall peace be upon us as upon the Israel of God; but we must follow our ministers only as they follow Christ. All their way through the wilderness was an untrodden path, but most so this through Jordan. While we are here, we must expect and prepare to pass ways that we have not passed before; but in the path of duty we may proceed with boldness and cheerfulness. Whether we are called to suffer poverty, pain, labour, persecution, reproach, or death, we are following the Author and Finisher of our faith; nor can we set our feet in any dangerous or difficult spot, through our whole journey, but faith will there see the prints of the Redeemer's feet, who trod that very path to glory above, and bids us follow him, that where he is, we may be also. They were to sanctify themselves. Would we experience the effects of God's love and power, we must put away sin, and be careful not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God.</body></html>
