The former have given the sense, but have changed the construction. The second have supposed <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> to mean <span class="accented">fail</span>, and to refer to the waters <span class="accented">below</span> the place of crossing. The third have interpolated the word "from." The words "the waters descending from above" are in apposition to, and explanatory of, the words "the waters" above. If for "from" in our version we substitute "namely," we shall express the meaning of the original. The Masorites point thus, dividing the verb from what follows by Zakeph Katon<span class="cmt_word">. A heap</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a>). The original is picturesque, "and they shall stand, one heap." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 The waters of Jordan shall be cut off. This must be done in such a way as never was done, but in the dividing of the Red sea. That miracle is here repeated; God has the same power to finish the salvation of his people, as to begin it; the WORD of the Lord was as truly with Joshua as with Moses. God's appearances for his people ought to encourage faith and hope. God's work is perfect, he will keep his people. Jordan's flood cannot keep out Israel, Canaan's force cannot turn them out again.</body></html>
