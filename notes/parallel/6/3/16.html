The reading makes no difference to the literal fact. The two prepositions, <span class= "ital">in and from, </span>express the same thought. The heap of water stood up as it were in Adam. From Adam to the place where Israel crossed, the river-bed was dry--the heap was as far away as Adam, but as it was not actually <span class= "ital">in </span>the city, the word <span class= "ital">in </span>was most likely altered to <span class= "ital">from. </span>The more difficult reading, <span class= "ital">in</span>, may very possibly be the best. For Zaretan see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm" title="Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:">1Kings 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-46.htm" title="In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.">1Kings 7:46</a>. Adam, as the name of a city, does not occur elsewhere. The meaning of the fact has been well pointed out by Bishop Wordsworth on this place. Zaretan was beneath Jezreel, but has not been identified. Adam has been thought to be at the ford Damieh, thirty miles away.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stood and rose up upon a heap.</span> Literally, "stood - they rose up, one heap." The narrative assumes a poetic form here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Very far from the city Adam.</span> The Masorites have corrected the text here. The original text has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> for which the suggested Keri is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;</span>. But the correction is needless. It is better to render, "they rose up, one heap, very far off, at the city Adam." The city Adam is nowhere else mentioned in Scripture, The LXX. appears to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;</span>, for it translates <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. This reading of the LXX. shows that the correction, though it obscures the sense, is of great antiquity, and that the site of Adam was then quite unknown. Knobel would place it either just south of the Jabbok, where the ford <span class="accented">Damieh</span> now exists, or at <span class="accented">Eduma</span>, now <span class="accented">Daumeh</span>, twelve German miles east of Neapolis. The former is generally accepted now, and Conder ('Handbook,' p. 241) identifies it with Admah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2</a>), in the plain or ciccar of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">That is beside Zaretan.</span> Called Zarthan in the original (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a>), and Zeredatha, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-17.htm">2 Chronicles 4:17</a>. Some read Zeredatha for Zererath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>. Knobel supposes, and not without some probability, that Zereda, Jeroboam's birthplace, is the same as this. It was in the plain of Jordan, not far from Succoth, at the mouth of the Jabbok. The LXX. here reads <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, either Kiriathaim or Kirjath-jearim, but without authority. Delitzsch and Knobel suppose the spot to be Kurn, or Karn (<span class="accented">i.e., horn</span>) Sartabeh, near the ford <span class="accented">Damieh</span>, where the Jordan valley is at its narrowest, and the rocks stretch forward so as almost to meet. They fix on this spot, partly from the suitability of the situation for such an arresting of the waters, partly from its agreement with the situation of Zarthan, as described in the Scriptures. Vandevelde agrees with them. There was an Adami and a Zartanath higher up the river near Bethshean, which some have supposed to be meant (see Joshua 19:83; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>), but these lay entirely out of Joshua's line of march. <span class="cmt_word">The sea of the plain.</span> Rather the sea of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;</span>, LXX.), or desert (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>). The term is applied by the Hebrews and Arabs to any sterile region, and thence to the sterile depression which borders on the Jordan, extending from the lake of Tiberias southward. The Arabs now apply the term <span class="accented">el ghor</span> to the part between Tiberias and the Dead Sea, and reserve the term Arabah for the desert valley, or wady, which extends thence to the Red Sea. So Gesen., 'Thesaurus,' s.v.; and Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.' The word translated <span class="accented">plain</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, a word of very different signification (see also 'Shephelah' and 'Emek,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The salt sea</span>. This sea is called the Dead Sea from the immobility of its waters, as well as from the apparent absence of all life within them. "Some of our party," says Canon Tristram," employed themselves in searching, but without avail, for life in the Dead Sea." It lies at a level of more than 1,300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its waters are thus described by Dr. Thomson: "The water is perfectly clear and transparent. The taste is bitter and salt, far beyond that of the ocean. It acts upon the tongue and mouth like alum; smarts in the eye like camphor; produces a burning, pricking sensation." The specific gravity of its waters is very great, and bathers find a great difficulty in swimming in it from the unusual buoyancy of the water. This is caused by the very large quantity of saline matter held in solution from the salt hills in the neighbourhood. One of them, Jebel Usdum, is described by Canon Tristram as "a solid mass of rock salt," and the water in its vicinity as "syrup of chloride of sodium," that is to say, of common salt. So also Bartlett, 'Egypt and Palestine,' p. 451. The statement that no bird can fly across its waters is a fable. The fullest account of the various attempts - some of them fatal - to explore the Dead Sea are to be found in Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine,' vol. 3. Canon Tristram explored the western side thoroughly, while Mr. Macgregor's canoe voyage, described in his 'Rob Roy on the Jordan,' gives a number of most interesting details. In Ritter's work will also be found some valuable observations on the physical geography of the district, on the geological formation of the basin of the Dead Sea, together with two papers, one by M. Terreil and the other by M. Lartet, on the chemical composition of the Dead Sea waters. <span class="cmt_word">Failed and were cut off.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">were completed, were cut off, i.e.</span>, were completely cut off, so that the supply of water failed, and the channel of the Jordan to the southward, and to the northward as far as Zaretan, became dry ground (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-17 Jordan overflowed all its banks. This magnified the power of God, and his kindness to Israel. Although those who oppose the salvation of God's people have all advantages, yet God can and will conquer. This passage over Jordan, as an entrance to Canaan, after their long, weary wanderings in the wilderness, shadowed out the believer's passage through death to heaven, after he has finished his wanderings in this sinful world. Jesus, typified by the ark, hath gone before, and he crossed the river when it most flooded the country around. Let us treasure up experiences of His faithful and tender care, that they may help our faith and hope in the last conflict.</body></html>
