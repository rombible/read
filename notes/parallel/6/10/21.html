Most likely the pursuit lasted one or two days. After the return to Makkedah the execution of the kings was carried out with much ceremony (ver. 24), and their bodies hung up before all Israel, not so much as a memorial of the victory, as to impress upon the Israelites the duty of exterminating their enemies, a duty which the after history of the twelve tribes shows them to have been very prone to forget. <span class="cmt_word">None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">He did not sharpen against the children of Israel, against a man, his tongue.</span> The Hebrew construction here is somewhat unusual. Houbigant and Maurer suppose that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;</span>is a mistake of the copyist and that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> is the subject of the sentence. They would translate as the LXX., "no man muttered with his tongue against the children of Israel." But Keil and Rosenmuller prefer a rendering agreeing with that of the Authorised Version, <span class="accented">node moved</span> (or <span class="accented">sharpened</span>) <span class="accented">his tongue against the children of Israel, not against a single man of them.</span> And this is a far more forcible way of expressing the awe in which they were held. A still stronger expression is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-7.htm">Exodus 11:7</a>; cf. Judith 11:19. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-27 None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. This shows their perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebels against the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God's judgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act of justice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sins of the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type and figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and of believers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we must not be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursue our scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise up in our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord will afford light until the warfare be accomplished.</body></html>
