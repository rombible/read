He takes immediate measures to secure their persons, but for the present throws his whole strength, as well as that of his army, into the task of following up the advantage he has gained<span class="cmt_word">. And smite the hindmost of them.</span> Literally, "and <span class="accented">tail</span> them," a verb denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e0;&#x5d1;</span> tail. The LXX. renders <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. The word is of rare occurrence in the Hebrew, but its obvious meaning is as the text. Comp. also the Vulgate, <span class="accented">extremos quosque fugientium coedite.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-27 None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. This shows their perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebels against the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God's judgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act of justice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sins of the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type and figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and of believers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we must not be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursue our scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise up in our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord will afford light until the warfare be accomplished.</body></html>
