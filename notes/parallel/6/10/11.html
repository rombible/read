But the next sentence of the verse states that they were <span class="accented">hailstones</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>. And even if there were not sufficient evidence of the fall of hailstones large enough to do great destruction to man and beast, we might fall back upon the theory that this was a miraculous hailstorm, since the whole history teems with miraculous intervention. But in point of fact this is unnecessary. We need not go further back than the famous storm of August 2nd, 1879, for an account of hailstones of enormous size falling within fifty miles of London. And in tropical climates still more destructive storms are of no infrequent occurrence. Every treatise on physical geography teems with instances. Masius refers to the well known story of the relief afforded by a sudden shower to Marcus Aurelius and his army, which he follows Eusebius in thinking attributable to Christian prayers, but which the emperor, in a medal struck on the occasion, attributed to Jupiter Pluvius (see Neander, 'Hist. of Christian Church,' vol. 1.). He also fcites the verses of Claudian on a similar victory of Theodosius: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"O nimium dilecte Deo, tibi militat aether<br />Et conjurati veniunt ad praelia venti."</span> They were more which died with hailstones. A conclusive proof, both to the Israelites and their antagonists, that the victory was owing rather to the favour of God than to the power of man, and suggesting the exclamation of the Psalmist, "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to Thy Name give glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>). See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4, 5</a>. It is, perhaps, worth while to remark that the printers have modernized this passage. For <span class="accented">more</span> the original edition has <span class="accented">moe</span>; cf. Shakspeare's ' Lover's Complaint,' line 47 - "Found yet <span class="accented">mo</span> letters sadly penned in blood." "Faith and troth they would no <span class="accented">mo"</span> (Greene, 'Shepherd's Ode '). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:7-14 The meanest and most feeble, who have just begun to trust the Lord, are as much entitled to be protected as those who have long and faithfully been his servants. It is our duty to defend the afflicted, who, like the Gibeonites, are brought into trouble on our account, or for the sake of the gospel. Joshua would not forsake his new vassals. How much less shall our true Joshua fail those who trust in Him! We may be wanting in our trust, but our trust never can want success. Yet God's promises are not to slacken and do away, but to quicken and encourage our endeavours. Notice the great faith of Joshua, and the power of God answering it by the miraculous staying of the sun, that the day of Israel's victories might be made longer. Joshua acted on this occasion by impulse on his mind from the Spirit of God. It was not necessary that Joshua should speak, or the miracle be recorded, according to the modern terms of astronomy. The sun appeared to the Israelites over Gibeon, and the moon over the valley of Ajalon, and there they appeared to be stopped on their course for one whole day. Is any thing too hard for the Lord? forms a sufficient answer to ten thousand difficulties, which objectors have in every age started against the truth of God as revealed in his written word. Proclamation was hereby made to the neighbouring nations, Behold the works of the Lord, and say, What nation is there so great as Israel, who has God so nigh unto them?</body></html>
