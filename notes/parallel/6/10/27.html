Joshua set the example to the Israelites of a strict observance of the law. And we may observe that this law is only to be found in Deuteronomy. On the "Deuteronomist" theory we have to suppose that the Deuteronomist, with a lynx eye to the chance of recommending the provisions which he had invented, and to the importance of representing Joshua as a strict observer of them, inserted this piece of detail with an obvious purpose. It is a wonder that this should be almost the only "Deuteronomist" precept thus emphasised. We find it noticed above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>), and in both cases the obvious explanation is that this sign of triumph made a great impression on those who witnessed it, and that it was carried out in strict fulfilment of enactments already existing. On the other hand, as we have seen, there is no attempt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a> to emphasise thus the obedience to the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-2.htm">Deuteronomy 27:2-8</a>. It is from minute details of this kind, which escape the superficial observer, that the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy is established. <span class="cmt_word">Until this very day.</span> The form of the expression here is singularly different from the expression found elsewhere when the meaning suggested by the Authorized Version is to be conveyed. But for the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> we should translate "on the self-same day," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>, etc. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> may be a slip of the pen for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> which is seldom, if ever, used of time (only, if at all, in Psalm 48:15, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>), though the idiom is found in Arabic, in Greek (as in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), in German (as in <span class="accented">auf den Tag.</span>) and in English, "on that day;" or we may, with Keil, refer back to ver. 18, and trans. late "they cast them into the cave where they had been hid, and where they had placed great stones unto that very day." For there may have been an interval of several days between the confinement of the kings in the cave and their death at the hands of Joshua. See note on ver. 21. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-27 None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. This shows their perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebels against the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God's judgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act of justice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sins of the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type and figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and of believers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we must not be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursue our scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise up in our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord will afford light until the warfare be accomplished.</body></html>
