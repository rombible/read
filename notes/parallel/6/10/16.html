Dr. Maclear remarks on the number of caves in Palestine (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-30.htm">Genesis 19:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-47.htm">Judges 20:47</a>), as well as the well-known caves of Adullam and Engedi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>, 24:3), and the cave in which a hundred prophets were concealed by Obadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). Also see note on Joshua 2:22. But Lieut. Conder believes that in this particular neighbourhood there were few caves. See note on Makkedah above, ver. 10. For "these five kings" the original has simply "five kings." The order of the narrative is somewhat interrupted by the introduction of Joshua's adjuration, and the account of the flight of the five kings. Compare ver. 11 with ver. 20. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-27 None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. This shows their perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebels against the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God's judgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act of justice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sins of the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type and figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and of believers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we must not be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursue our scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise up in our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord will afford light until the warfare be accomplished.</body></html>
