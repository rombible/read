Bahr ('Symbolik des Alten Testaments,' 1:221) remarks on the symbolical meaning of this number. He compares it, first, to the twelve tribes marching in four detachments, the ark of God and its guard in the centre (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.). Four, he says, is the number of the world, and three the sign of God, and twelve of the combination of the two. Thus we are reminded of the heavenly city which "lieth four-square," which has "twelve foundations of precious stones," "twelve gates of pearls, and at the gates twelve angels," and the names of "the twelve tribes of Israel" written thereupon, and wherein was "the tree of life," with its "twelve manner of fruits," which were "yielded every month" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12, 14, 16, 19, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 The Levites waited till the other tribes were provided for, before they preferred their claim to Joshua.

The maintenance of ministers is not a thing left merely to the will of the people, that they may let them starve if they please; they which preach the gospel should live by the gospel, and should live comfortably.</body></html>
