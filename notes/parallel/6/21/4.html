In the camp of Israel there were two squares surrounding the tabernacle: an inner square of priests and Levites, an outer square of the tribes of Israel, three on each side. The inner square was arranged thus:--The priests, with Moses and Aaron, on the east, by the entrance of the tabernacle; the Kohathites on the south, the Gershonites on the west, and the Merarites on the north. On the march the priests were the chief officers of this portion of the army. The Kohathites carried the sacred vessels, the Gershonites the curtains and various fabrics of the tent and tabernacle, and the Merarites the bars and boards. When they received their inheritances in Palestine, the same relative order was preserved.<p><span class= "bld">INHERITANCE OF THE PRIESTS </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/21-9.htm" title="And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.">Joshua 21:9-19</a>).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Out of the tribe of . . .

The Merarites are employed to connect two tribes on the east of Jordan with one upon the west, and the south-east of the Israelitish territory with the north. Thus "the whole body by joints and bands" was "knit together, that it might grow with a growth of God." It is not a little interesting to observe that Joshua's work of dividing the land of Canaan was so much directed to preserve the union of the several parts. The name of Levi (<span class= "ital">joined</span>) thus received a spiritual emphasis. He was divided in Israel that he might be a bond of union, bringing the tribes of Israel together, and joining all of them to their God.<p><span class= "bld">Jokneam</span> (<span class= "ital">Tell Keim-n, </span>near Carmel).<p>(35) <span class= "bld">Nahalal</span> ('<span class= "ital">Ain Mahil</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>(43) <span class= "bld">And the Lord gave unto Israel.</span>--Although the conquest of Canaan was not completed in the time of Joshua, as it was afterwards under David, yet we see by this statement that the expectations of Israel were abundantly satisfied.

Thus solemnly placed in His hands, the division would not afterwards become the occasion of jealousy or dispute. The division was first made between the descendants of the three sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16-25</a>), and then, as regards the Kohathites, between the priests, the descendants of Aaron, and the rest of the Levites. We have remarked above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a>) on the disinterestedness of Joshua. We have now to remark on the same characteristic as displayed by Moses. There was no attempt on the part of Moses to "found a family," the object of ambition with most men, whether kings or private persons possessed of wealth. No special privileges belonged to his descendants. They merged in the undistinguished herd of the Levites generally. In this Moses contrasts favourably with most public men in our own day; he stands out prominently before nearly all the great leaders and conquerors before or even after the Christian era. The same may be said of Joshua, his successor. Cincinnatus may be in some measure compared with them, but as a dictator simply in time of danger, his power was by no means so absolute, nor were his temptations so great as those of the two successive leaders of the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Thirteen cities.</span> It has been contended by Maurer and others that this number of cities was largely in excess of what could possibly be required for the descendants of Aaron in so short a time. But we have to consider <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the cities were probably not, at least at first, inhabited exclusively by the priests; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Israelites multiplied rapidly, and that the number of descendants in the fourth generation would probably be nearly a thousand, and in the fifth, above five thousand; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that all the cities were not, as yet, actually taken from the Canaanites at all, and so therefore were in all probability only intended as an eventual possession of the priests, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that the cities themselves were probably not of any very great size. It may be worthy of remark, as a proof of the accuracy of the writers of the Old Testament, and as a means of approximately ascertaining the date of the Book of Joshua, that Nob, mentioned as a priestly city in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-11.htm">1 Samuel 22:11, 19</a>, is not found in the list given here. For the number of priests being sure to increase, it is not surprising that in the course of time additional cities should be assigned to them. And since Nob is not mentioned here, we have good grounds for concluding that the Book of Joshua was not a compilation put together after the reign of Saul Calvin does not fail to remark on the prescience of God here demonstrated. He had fixed upon Jerusalem as the place where he would "put His Name." He therefore directed that the lot of the priests should fall within the limits of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, on whose borders Jerusalem stood. Simeon is also mentioned, but the territory of that tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>), was contained within the borders of Judah. <span class="cmt_word">For theirs was the first lot</span>. Not because Kohath was the firstborn, for this Gershon appears to have been, but because to Aaron and his sons had the priesthood been reserved. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 The Levites waited till the other tribes were provided for, before they preferred their claim to Joshua. They build their claim upon a very good foundation; not their own merits or services, but the Divine precept. The maintenance of ministers is not a thing left merely to the will of the people, that they may let them starve if they please; they which preach the gospel should live by the gospel, and should live comfortably.</body></html>
