The student of Scripture will not fail to recall the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-8.htm">Joshua 4:8</a>) in which reference is made to this passage, and especially to the LXX. version of it. The word signifies rather rest from wandering than rest from toil, though in some passages (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>) it has the latter signification (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Round about.</span> Or, <span class="accented">from</span> round about, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the assaults of the surrounding nations. <span class="cmt_word">According to all that he sware</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There stood not a man of all their enemies before them</span>. This was true, as far as the present history is concerned. We read that the Ephraimites did not, or "could not," drive out their enemies, and that the other tribes also failed to obtain complete possession of the land. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we are not told that this was in the time of Joshua, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is intimated that this was their own fault. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How could it be otherwise? Had the same faith been theirs which caused the Jordan to dry up, and the towers of Jericho to fall down at their march, which discomfited one vast confederacy at Beth-horon, and annihilated another vast confederacy, even better supplied with munitions of war at Lake Merom, they could not have failed to root out the scanty remnant of their humiliated and disheartened foes. As has already been remarked (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>, note), it was from no neglect on Joshua's part that this was not done at once, for it had been God's own command that it should not be done, lest the country should become a desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>). Calvin concludes a similar argument with the words, "nothing but their own cowardice prevented them from enjoying the blessings of God in all their fulness." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:43-45 God promised to give to the seed of Abraham the land of Canaan for a possession, and now they possessed it, and dwelt therein. And the promise of the heavenly Canaan is as sure to all God's spiritual Israel; for it is the promise of Him that cannot lie. There stood not a man before them. The after-prevalence of the Canaanites was the effect of Israel's slothfulness, and the punishment of their sinful inclination to the idolatries and abominations of the heathen whom they harboured and indulged. There failed not aught of any good thing, which the Lord had spoken to the house of Israel. In due season all his promises will be accomplished; then will his people acknowledge that the Lord has exceeded their largest expectations, and made them more than conquerors, and brought them to their desired rest.</body></html>
