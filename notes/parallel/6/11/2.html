The word Arabah is given untranslated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18</a>. This was, no doubt, the great Ghor, or depression of the Jordan, or at least the northern part of it, extending for some distance south of the town of Chinneroth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>). This town gave its name to the lake or inland sea now better known to the student of Scriptures as the sea of Tiberias, or lake of Gennesareth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>). "As we enter upon the geological character of the basin which contains the sea of Galilee, we see at once that it is simply one element of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea, which extends due north and south for a distance of sixty hours. This is the Ghor, or Sunken Valley of the Arabah" (see note on Joshua 3:16)," extending from Hasbeya to the AElanitic gulf as a continuous cleft - the deepest one known to us" (Ritter, 2:241). He goes on to enumerate the various signs of volcanic agency in this region; the frequent earthquakes, the form of the basin of Gennesareth (though he denies it to be a crater), the hot springs, the frequent eaves, the naphtha deposits and springs, the hot water springs to be found even in the Dead Sea, the lofty crystalline masses of the Sinaitic peninsula, and the porphyritic dykes found at the southern end Of the Ghor, as well as the general conformation of the country east of Jordan. The sea of Chinneroth, or Tiberias, is stated by Conder (Handbook, pp. 212, 216) to be 682.5 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. And in the valley. The Shephelah, or lowland district (see above <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1</a>). The borders of Dot. Rather, the <span class="accented">heights</span>, or <span class="accented">highlands</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> Vulg. <span class="accented">regionibus</span>) of Dor. This elevated position was a remarkable feature of the neighbourhood, though the various translations of the word (as "coast," <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a>; "region," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>) rather obscure the prominence given to this physical characteristic in the Scripture narrative. Rosenmuller would translate it the "promontory" of Dor, for Dot (now <span class="accented">Tantura, Tortura</span>, or <span class="accented">Dandora</span>) was upon the sea coast south of Carmel, and nine Roman miles north of Caesarea. Thus situated, its position on a hill, though the hill is not a lofty one, would strike the observer, and it accounts for the peculiar form of speech noticed above, which is so common that in the LXX. it is usually given as part of the proper name, <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span>, ch. 12:23; <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>). And behind it are still higher rocky ridges, to which the name also applies. Dor, with its excellent harbour, was a noted place of commerce in ancient times, especially in the <span class="accented">murex coccineus</span>, from which the far famed Tyrian dye was obtained. These are a species of mussel, and Seetzen mentions two varieties, the <span class="accented">murex trunculus</span> of Linnaeus, and the <span class="accented">Helix ianthina.</span> The latter is of a whitish green, but when taken out of the water it passes from red to purple, and after death to violet. Its use has been superseded by that of the cochineal insect, but the Tyrian purple was in great demand in early times. Its costliness may be inferred from the fact that in each insect a little pouch behind the head, not the size of a pea, contains the dye. See Ritter, 4:280, 281; Pliny, ' Nat. Hist.' 9, 36 (60 in some editions); and' Epist.' 50, 10, 26. The allusions to it by Horace, Virgil, Juvenal, and other classical authors are too numerous for quotation. We may take as instances Virgil, Georg. 3:17: "Illi victor ego, et Tyrio conspectus in ostro" (cf. AEn. 4:262): and Juvenal, Sat. 7:134; "Spondet enim Tyrio stlataria purpura filo." The ruins of the ancient city still crown the steeps of its site (see Vandevelde's Memoir, and Conder's Handbook. Also Keil <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">.<span class="cmt_word"></span> On the west</span>. The LXX. renders, "And to the Amorites on the sea coast" (see last note), leaving out all mention of the Canaanites. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 The wonders God wrought for the Israelites were to encourage them to act vigorously themselves. Thus the war against Satan's kingdom, carried on by preaching the gospel, was at first forwarded by miracles; but being fully proved to be of God, we are now left to the Divine grace in the usual course, in the use of the sword of the Spirit. God encouraged Joshua. Fresh dangers and difficulties make it necessary to seek fresh supports from the word of God, which we have nigh unto us for use in every time of need. God proportions our trials to our strength, and our strength to our trials. Joshua's obedience in destroying the horses and chariots, shows his self-denial in compliance with God's command. The possession of things on which the carnal heart is prone to depend, is hurtful to the life of faith, and the walk with God; therefore it is better to be without worldly advantages, than to have the soul endangered by them.</body></html>
