It must not be pressed to mean the utter destruction of all the Canaanites, and the undisturbed possession of the country. <span class="cmt_word">The hills.</span> The mountain country of Judah, in the south. The same word is translated "mountain" immediately afterwards, to the confusion of the sense, which contrasts the mountains of Israel with the mountains of Judah (see ver. 21). This would seem at first sight to lead to the conclusion that the Book of Joshua was composed after the jealousy between Judah and the rest of Israel had sprung up in the time of David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41</a>-48). But Dr. Edersheim has suggested another explanation. Judah, he says (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a>), entered upon their inheritance, while the other tribes were still in Gilgal. In the same way Mount Ephraim is so called because it was given to that tribe, and occupied by them shortly after. While as the remaining seven tribes remained without their inheritance (Reuben and Gad as well as Manasseh and Ephraim being now provided for), the rest of the mountains were known as the mountains of Israel. This explanation is ingenious, but hardly satisfactory. Ephraim (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1</a>) early acquired a preponderance over the other tribes. We should therefore expect a threefold division of the mountain district, the mountains of Judah, of Joseph, and of Israel, especially as Ephraim was the next after Judah to enter upon its inheritance. The internal evidence seems to prove that the Book of Joshua was written by one of the tribe of Judah, or by a Levite residing within the borders of that tribe. Perhaps this affords the best explanation, but is quite possible that the whole mountain district of Palestine is here meant. <span class="cmt_word">The south.</span> The Negeb, or dry country (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The valley.</span> The <span class="accented">Shephelah</span>, or lowlands (see note on Joshua 9:1). This must have extended from Gaza northward to Joppa, while the Shephelah of Israel mentioned immediately below must be the lowland tract from Joppa to Mount Carmel. <span class="cmt_word">The plain</span>. The Arabah (see note on Joshua 3:16). <span class="cmt_word">And the valley of the same.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">his</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Israel's) <span class="accented">lowland.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:15-23 Never let the sons of Anak be a terror to the Israel of God, for their day to fall will come. The land rested from war. It ended not in a peace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace from them. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished. That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually to set each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need not question the performance of the promise. But the believer must never put off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes in death; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect more heavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault the believer till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus ever lives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, however Satan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, and difficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may be encouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest from sin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.</body></html>
