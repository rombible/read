But it had almost died out. Goliath and his brethren seem to have been regarded by the Philistines, as much as by the Hebrews, in the light of prodigies. It may be that the race deteriorated in size and strength, when driven from the mountain district. Gaza (Hebrew Azzah, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>) was a stronghold of the Philistines. We first find it mentioned as the border of Canaan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>. It was the scene of the exploits of Samson, related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16.htm">Judges 16</a>. It, with Gath, Ekron, Ashdod, and Ashkelon, formed the five Philistine lordships mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>. Gaza does not appear in the list of cities captured by David, although Gath does. Perhaps the strength of its position (Azzah signifies strength) may have enabled it to resist David and Solomon, whose dominions are said to have extended to, but not to have included, Azzah. We read little more of it in the Old Testament. Jeremiah says that Pharaoh smote it (Joshua 47:1); Amos and Zephaniah threatened it with punishment. It is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a> as a place of some importance. And it still exists, at about an hour's journey from the sea, and is now called Ghazzeh. (see also note on ver. 41). Gath. Also one of the five Philistine lordships. In David's time it had a king, with whom David took refuge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). It was afterwards conquered by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-20.htm">2 Samuel 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-6.htm">1 Chronicles 20:6</a>). We find it in Solomon's jurisdiction, though under the government of one of its own royal family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>). Rehoboam fortified it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). Hazael, the powerful king of Syria, wrested it from Jehoash, and was only bought air from assailing Jerusalem. Uzziah retook it once more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). Hezekiah seems to have retained it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>). After this we hear no more of it. Modern travellers and commentators have identified it with Beit-Jibrin (the house of the mighty - perhaps a reminiscence of Goliath and his kindred), now Eleutheropolis (so Knobel). Others suppose it to be the Blanche Garde of the Crusaders, or Tell-es-Safieh, an opinion supported, among others, by Mr. J. L. Porter and Lieut. Conder. See, however, the note on Libnah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>. Ashdod. Later Azotus, now Esdud. Here the ark was carried after the disastrous defeat related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>. It was conquered by Uzziah (no doubt it had formerly been reduced by David), who built forts to overawe it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), but it fell into the hands of Sargon, king of Assyria, a little later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>). It is frequently mentioned by the prophets, and we find that Jonathan, the brother of Judas Maceabaeus, burnt the temple of Dagon there (1 Macc. 10:83, 84). It is mentioned as Azotus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:15-23 Never let the sons of Anak be a terror to the Israel of God, for their day to fall will come. The land rested from war. It ended not in a peace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace from them. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished. That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually to set each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need not question the performance of the promise. But the believer must never put off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes in death; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect more heavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault the believer till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus ever lives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, however Satan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, and difficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may be encouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest from sin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.</body></html>
