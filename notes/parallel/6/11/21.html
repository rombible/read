The death of Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the three sons of Anak, the chiefs of the Anakim, is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Judges 1:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at that time</span> (see ver. 18). What is meant is, during the continuance of the war in which the country above described was conquered. The destruction of the Anakim was the conclusion of the work, and was rendered necessary by their having reoccupied the places Joshua had taken (see notes on Joshua 10:36-39). <span class="cmt_word">The Anakims.</span> Literally, the <span class="accented">long-necked</span> men. Called the "children of Anak" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-28.htm">Numbers 13:28, 33</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13, 14</a>). Gesenius would derive the German <span class="accented">nacken</span> and the English <span class="accented">neck</span> from this root. The word is used of the chains on the necks of camels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>. So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>, of a necklace). They were men of gigantic stature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32</a>), and were no doubt a hill tribe of the Amorites. It is worthy of remark that to the two fearless men whose faith did not fail them at the sight of the walled cities, and of the giant forms of their inhabitants, was entrusted the task of overcoming these antagonists, and thus of proving the truth of their own words. Thus it ever is in the counsels of God. "To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away." To Joshua, who had confidence in God, the whole land of Canaan was given into subjection. From the Israelites, who had not that confidence, the inheritance of their fathers was taken away (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21, 28</a>). Many writers suppose that these Anakim (like the Rephaim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>) were the aboriginal inhabitants, and of Turanian descent (see note on next verse). <span class="cmt_word">Anab</span>. A town about ten miles southwest of Hebron (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-50.htm">Joshua 15:50</a>). It was apparently one of the daughter cities of Debir, and there is still a place of that name in the immediate vicinity of Dhaharijeh. <span class="cmt_word">Mountains of Judah.</span> For this and the "mountains of Israel" see note on ver. 16. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:15-23 Never let the sons of Anak be a terror to the Israel of God, for their day to fall will come. The land rested from war. It ended not in a peace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace from them. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished. That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually to set each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need not question the performance of the promise. But the believer must never put off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes in death; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect more heavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault the believer till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus ever lives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, however Satan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, and difficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may be encouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest from sin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.</body></html>
