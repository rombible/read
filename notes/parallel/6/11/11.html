Hazor was afterwards rebuilt and reoccupied by the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), though not in the time of Joshua. For the present, this destruction of the stronghold of Phoenician power in the north was a decisive measure, and would have been so permanently had the Israelites followed up the policy of Joshua. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:10-14 The Canaanites filled up the measure of their iniquity, and were, as a judgment, left to the pride, obstinacy, and enmity of their hearts, and to the power of Satan; all restraints being withdrawn, while the dispensations of Providence tended to drive them to despair. They brought on themselves the vengeance they justly merited, of which the Israelites were to be executioners, by the command the Lord gave to Moses.</body></html>
