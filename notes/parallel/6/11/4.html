The comparison is more picturesque than accurate. In the first place, it was by no means a "last struggle" (see ver. 21; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-3.htm">Joshua 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>. throughout). In the next, the Britons were never driven to the Land's End, but Dorsetshire, which retained its independence for 200 years, was treated by Ina as Gezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>), was treated by the Ephraimites, while Devonshire and Cornwall came very gradually and almost peacefully under the hands of the conquerors. And thirdly, even had it been otherwise, there is a vast difference between a handful of desperate men driven to bay on a tongue of land surrounded nearly on every side by the sea, and a powerful, though defeated, nation with a vast continent in its rear. Yet there are many features common to the history of the Israelites in Canaan, and of the Teutonic tribes in Britain (see Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">As the sand that is upon the sea shore.</span> This poetic phrase is common in the Hebrew writings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>, etc.). Solomon's capacious intellect is compared to the sand on the sea shore, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29</a>. The word translated "shore" is "lip" in the original, a word which adds to the poetry of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">And horses and chariots very many.</span> Literally, many ex<span class="accented">ceedingly.</span> The Israelites appear to have held cavalry and chariots in great awe (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-18.htm">Exodus 14:18</a>, and the song of triumph in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>). In later times they appear to have become more used to them. See, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, where the historian gives their number, large as it was, instead of regarding it as past all computation. This battle must have taken place on level ground, or the chariots would have been useless. Accordingly the historian fixes its scene on the banks of "the waters of Merom," where such ground is to be found - another instance of his historical accuracy (see Vandevelde, Journey 2:413, who places the battle on the great plain southwest of the latter). The use of chariots in battle dates from an early period. Homer's heroes are described as driven to battle in them. But perhaps the scythe chariots are here meant, which are not found on early Egyptian monuments, but which Xenophon in his Cyropaedia says were introduced By Cyrus. We find them, however, in use in Britain, in the days of Julius Caesar, and they could hardly have obtained the idea from the Persians. Potter (Antiquities, bk. 3. ch. 1.) says that they were gradually abandoned when they were found more dangerous to those who used them than to the enemy. That this kind of chariot is here meant seems pretty certain from the alarm they caused. No such alarm would have been caused by chariots simply used to convey the chieftains to the fight (see Gesenius, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> Xenophon, Cyr. 6:4; and 2 Macc. 13:2). <span class="cmt_word">All their hosts</span>. The LXX. reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5de;</span> their <span class="accented">kings</span>, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 The wonders God wrought for the Israelites were to encourage them to act vigorously themselves. Thus the war against Satan's kingdom, carried on by preaching the gospel, was at first forwarded by miracles; but being fully proved to be of God, we are now left to the Divine grace in the usual course, in the use of the sword of the Spirit. God encouraged Joshua. Fresh dangers and difficulties make it necessary to seek fresh supports from the word of God, which we have nigh unto us for use in every time of need. God proportions our trials to our strength, and our strength to our trials. Joshua's obedience in destroying the horses and chariots, shows his self-denial in compliance with God's command. The possession of things on which the carnal heart is prone to depend, is hurtful to the life of faith, and the walk with God; therefore it is better to be without worldly advantages, than to have the soul endangered by them.</body></html>
