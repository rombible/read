The law of the wave sheaf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10, 11</a>) was intended to apply to corn raised by the Israelites on their own land, after Canaan had been divided to them for an inheritance (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And parched corn;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, ears roasted at the fire, and the grain afterwards rubbed out, a custom still in use among the Arabs (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-17.htm">1 Samuel 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>, etc. See also for the precept here followed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>). This verse therefore adds some confirmation to the view that until their arrival in Palestine a full observance of the precepts of the law was impossible (see above, ver. 6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:10-12 A solemn passover was kept, at the time appointed by the law, in the plains of Jericho, in defiance of the Canaanites round about them. It was a performance of the promise, that when they went up to keep the feasts, their land should be under the special protection of the Divine providence, Ex 34:24. Notice is taken of the ceasing of the manna as soon as they had eaten the old corn of the land. For as it came just when they needed, so it continued as long as they needed it. This teaches us not to expect supplies by miracles, when they may be had in a common way. The word and ordinances of God are spiritual manna, with which God nourishes his people in this wilderness. Though often forfeited, yet they are continued while we are here; but when we come to the heavenly Canaan, this manna will cease, for we shall no longer need it.</body></html>
