It is applied to the Israelites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>. In the singular it means a people in the more general sense, a nation, as distinguished from a people in whom one has an interest. In the plural it always means the Gentiles. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>. (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), the word usually applied to the people of God, is not used here, because the people who "provoked God in the wilderness" had made themselves in a sense a rejected people. Delitzsch regards this (after Calvin) as a sign that, for the time at least, the covenant between God and Israel was annulled, permanently in the case of those who were condemned to die in the wilderness, temporarily only in their descendants, who were formally reconciled to God, and restored to their former covenant position by this solemn performance of the covenant rite of circumcision (see note on verse 2). So also Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 205. The difficulty about the passover may be met by supposing that those only who were circumcised - a constantly decreasing number, of course - were allowed to celebrate that feast. Knobel would understand that in consequence of the "unquiet, unsettled, uncomfortable life" the Israelites led in the wilderness, they could keep very few of the ordained feasts. He continues: "the Elohist knows nothing of any cessation." Nevertheless we read of no passover being <span class="accented">kept</span> after the one recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-5.htm">Numbers 9:5</a>, so that if "the Elohist knows of no cessation," he knows as little of any continued observance of the feast. But there is no certainty on the point. Considering the loose way in which the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> is used in Scripture (see, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>), we need not press the word to include <span class="accented">all</span> who were born after the departure from Egypt, but only those who were born after the rejection of the people recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> This rejection, be it remembered, did not include all the Israelites who were born in Egypt, but only those who were over twenty years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>). The view of Kurz (3:323, Clark's translation), that circumcision was suspended on account of the continual movements of the Israelites, is refuted by Delitzsch's remark that the Israelites were not continually on the march, but that they often encamped in one place for a long period, a period far longer, in fact, than the time in which they abode in Gilgal. Delitzsch asks why this circumcision did not take place before, why it was not performed as soon as they crossed the brook Zered. The answer is that, until the Jordan was crossed, they had not taken formal possession of their own land. As soon as, under the Divine protection, they had crossed the Jordan, the long-delayed promise was fulfilled. God's covenant with Abraham was accomplished, and now they, in their turn, had to place themselves once more in the position of God's covenant people, bound to serve Him with their whole heart. For a fuller discussion of this question see Keil's Commentary, and Hengstenberg in the passage cited above. We may observe that God fulfils His part of the covenant first, and then it is man's duty to fulfil his. God, under the Christian dispensation, first places us in the state of salvation. Then it becomes our duty to make that salvation sure by overcoming God's enemies, by the help which He never fails to afford. Give us. This introduction of the first person into the middle of the sentence is unexpected. Some MSS. and editors read "to them" (see note on ver. 1, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>, where there is a similar change of person). <span class="cmt_word">A land that floweth with milk and honey.</span> This, says Keil, "is a standing expression in the Pentateuch to express the great fertility of the land of Canaan. Milk and honey are produced by a land rich in grass and flowers, which were both of them plentiful in Canaan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15, 22</a>). Milk, not only of cows, but of sheep and goats also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>), and eaten sometimes sweet, at other times thick or curdled (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>), was a leading article of food amongst the ancient Hebrews, as it is in the present day in most Eastern countries, and Palestine was peculiarly fitted for the rearing of cattle. Honey also, especially that of wild bees, was found in large quantities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>, sqq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-26.htm">1 Samuel 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and is still found, notwithstanding its present desolate condition." Some have thought <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to mean the newly expressed juice of grapes, which, under the Arabic name of <span class="accented">dibs</span>, is largely used at present in Palestine, and is even exported to other countries.

Oh that they would now take warning, and before it be too late, flee for refuge to lay hold upon that hope set before them in the gospel!

They were hereby owned to be the free-born children of God, having the seal of the covenant. When God glorifies himself in perfecting the salvation of his people, he not only silences all enemies, but rolls back their reproaches upon themselves.</body></html>
