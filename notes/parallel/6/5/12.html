Thirty-nine years and eleven months it fell, except on the Sabbath. It kept Sabbath all through the wilderness, on the seventh day of the week, and it finally ceased, <span class= "ital">kept Sabbath </span>(<span class= "ital">vay-yishboth, </span>Hebrew) <span class= "ital">on the very day afterwards marked by our Lord's resurrection, which became the Lord's day. </span>The coincidence is too remarkable to be overlooked. It is the risen Christ who takes the place of the manna; and in the discourse wherein He calls Himself "the true bread from heaven," He points again and again to resurrection as the end of the life which He gives: "I will raise him up at the last day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>). Then the manna, which is the food of the wilderness, shall keep Sabbath, for "they shall hunger no more." The food of the wilderness is that which Israel ate, <span class= "ital">not knowing what it was. </span>Of the other world it is written, "<span class= "ital">then shall I know, even as also I am known."</span><p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The manna ceased.</span> It ceased when the Israelites entered a cultivated region. The eastern portion of their inheritance, though well suited for pastoral purposes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-12.htm">Joshua 1:12</a>), was not a land of agricultural produce. Therefore the manna did not cease until the Israelites had crossed the Jordan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 5:13-15. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:10-12 A solemn passover was kept, at the time appointed by the law, in the plains of Jericho, in defiance of the Canaanites round about them. It was a performance of the promise, that when they went up to keep the feasts, their land should be under the special protection of the Divine providence, Ex 34:24. Notice is taken of the ceasing of the manna as soon as they had eaten the old corn of the land. For as it came just when they needed, so it continued as long as they needed it. This teaches us not to expect supplies by miracles, when they may be had in a common way. The word and ordinances of God are spiritual manna, with which God nourishes his people in this wilderness. Though often forfeited, yet they are continued while we are here; but when we come to the heavenly Canaan, this manna will cease, for we shall no longer need it.</body></html>
