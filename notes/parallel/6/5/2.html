The expression is "knives of <span class= "ital">tsurim." </span>The word <span class= "ital">ts-r </span>does not seem anywhere to be connected with the material of the tool, but rather with the edge of it. <span class= "ital">Knives of keen edge </span>is, therefore, the better translation. At the same time they may have been stone knives in this instance. The idea that they were so is supported by an addition in the LXX. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-30.htm" title="And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.">Joshua 24:30</a> : "They put with him (Joshua) into the tomb . . . the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel . . . and there they are to this day."

I is introduced in order to explain why Joshua ventured upon the circumcision of the children of Israel at so critical a period. Nothing could more clearly evince the spirit of confidence in Jehovah which animated not only Joshua, but all the children of Israel. We read of no murmurings, although it was well known that the performance of the rite of circumcision would unfit the Israelites for active service for some days. We may imagine, and even the silence of the sacred historian may be deemed eloquent on the point, that the marvellous passage of the Jordan had inspired the Israelites with an eager desire to renew their covenant with the God who "had done so great things for them already." And although, for religious reasons, they remained inactive for four or five days, a course of action from a military point of view highly injudicious, yet such was the terror the passage of the Jordan had struck into the hearts of the Phoenicians that no attack on them was attempted, and the inhabitants of Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>) remained under the protection of their strong walls. <span class="cmt_word">Sharp knives,</span> or <span class="accented">knives of stone</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>; cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25</a>). The LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions, as well as the margins of our Bibles, render thus. On the other hand, several of the Rabbis give the same translation as the text of our version. The LXX. translator, following no doubt an ancient tradition, adds after <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-30.htm">Joshua 24:30</a>, that these knives were buried with Joshua (see note there). The idea which has found great favour lately of a "stone age," as anterior to an "iron age," of the world, will hardly derive support from this passage. That the use of stone preceded the use of iron scarcely admits of a doubt. But from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a> we learn that the use of iron had been known hundreds of years before Joshua, and yet we find him using stone knives. And we may go further. In spite of the advance of civilisation in our own day, there are still millions of human beings who have not advanced beyond the "stone age." The idea, then, of an age in which the universal use of iron has supplanted the universal use of stone is an idea which facts compel us to reject, while admitting that the use of stone must have preceded the use of iron in the infancy of the human race. In these "knives of flint," Origen, Theodoret, and others see an allusion to Christ, the rock. The second time. For "circumcise again the children of Israel the second time," the literal translation is, "return (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>) to circumcise," or, "return, circumcise" them the second time. This has perplexed the commentators and translators. It has been assumed that the text involves the idea of a former general circumcision of the people, and various are the expedients which have been resorted to in order to avoid the difficulty. Some copies of the LXX. would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span> (or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span> Rosenmuller), and translate "sit down" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, halt), "and circumcise" The Vulgate leaves out the word altogether. The Syriac translates literally. The Arabic reads "tomorrow" for "again." The Rabbi Solomon Jarchi falls back on the expedient of a general circumcision ordered by Moses on the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt, on account of their neglect of that rite while they sojourned there, "Nam jam antea magna multitudo simul erat circumcisa illa nocte qua egrediebantur ex AEgypto." But this is rendered highly improbable by the fact that circumcision was an Egyptian as well as a Hebrew custom, and still more so by the improbability that such an important circumstance should have been passed over in silence. Knobel regards Abraham's circumcision with that of his household as the first time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>). Perhaps the best explanation is that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, though it is rightly translated "again" here, and in several other places in Scripture, carries with it the idea of a <span class="accented">return into a former condition</span> (<span class="accented">kehre zuruck</span>, Knobel). So <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>, Hosea 2:11 (Hosea 2:9, in our version). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11, 13</a> we have the king's <span class="accented">return to his former purpose</span> in the second and third mission to Elijah. Thus here the word is used of the <span class="accented">bringing back</span> the children of Israel to their former state, that of a people who were in the enjoyment of a visible sign and seal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>) of their being God's covenant people. The meaning therefore would seem to be, "Restore the children of Israel a second time to the position they formerly held, as visibly bound to me, and placed under my protection, by the rite of circumcision." "The person must be in favour ere the work can hope to prosper; his predecessor Moses had like to have been slain for neglect of this sacrament, when he went to call the people out of Egypt; he justly fears his own safety, if now he omit it, when they are brought into Canaan" (Bp. Hall). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 How dreadful is their case, who see the wrath of God advancing towards them, without being able to turn it aside, or escape it! Such will be the horrible situation of the wicked; nor can words express the anguish of their feelings, or the greatness of their terror. Oh that they would now take warning, and before it be too late, flee for refuge to lay hold upon that hope set before them in the gospel! God impressed these fears on the Canaanites, and dispirited them. This gave a short rest to the Israelites, and circumcision rolled away the reproach of Egypt. They were hereby owned to be the free-born children of God, having the seal of the covenant. When God glorifies himself in perfecting the salvation of his people, he not only silences all enemies, but rolls back their reproaches upon themselves.</body></html>
