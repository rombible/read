Many MSS. which are followed by the LXX. and Syriac versions, have <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;</span> here. The Chaldee and Vulgate read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;</span>, and the Masorites do not reckon this among the 15 passages in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> is read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;</span> (Keil). But when Keil adds that a comparison of this passage with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-21.htm">Joshua 24:21</a> decides the point, he is going too far, since <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> often stands, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, before a quotation, in the place of our inverted commas (see, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-33.htm">Genesis 29:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>, etc.). The various reading has no doubt arisen from the ambiguity of the passage, for it appears grammatically doubtful to which part of Joshua's question the particle of negation applies. Yet it is obvious enough practically that it is in answer to the last portion of it. <span class="cmt_word">But as captain of the Lord's host am I now come.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">"for</span> (or <span class="accented">but</span>) <span class="accented">I, the captain of the Lord's host, have now come."</span> As though he would say, "the struggle is now imminent; the conflict is all but begun; and now, at the critical moment when my help is needed, I, the captain of the hosts of the Lord, the leader of all that vast army of unseen confederates, who are destined to marshal the forces of nature, the elements of supernatural terror and dismay, on the side of the Israelites, am come to help you." That the Lord's host must mean the angels is clear from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a>; St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a> (aft <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Hengstenberg, in his 'Christology,' illustrates by <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>. Two opinions have been held by the early Church concerning this manifestation. The first regards it as the appearance of the Son of God in a visible form; the second supposes it to have been a created being - an angel - through whom Jehovah was pleased to manifest Himself. The former opinion was general in the earliest ages of the Church. The appearance of the Arian heresy, however, brought this interpretation into discredit. It was felt to be dangerous to admit it, lest it should lead to the notion that the Logos, however great and glorious a being he might be, however superior to all other created beings, was nevertheless removed by an infinite interval from the Supreme God Himself. The Jewish interpreters differ on the point. Maimonides and others (see next note) do not regard the appearance as a real one. The majority seem <span class="accented">to</span> have supposed it to have been the Archangel Michael. We will proceed to examine the scriptural and patristic evidence on the subject. That appearances, believed to be manifestations of God Himself in a visible form, are recorded in Scripture, is a fact which cannot be denied. Thus we have the voice of God (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) walking in the garden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>). Again, in ch. 15, though first God appears to Abraham in a vision, the nature of the manifestation would seem to have changed in some respects afterwards, for we read" he brought him forth abroad" (ver. 5). Again, in ch. 18, we find that Jehovah "appeared" to Abraham as he dwelt by the oaks of Mature (ver. 1), and the narrative would suggest that Jehovah Himself appeared, and two attendant angels. This is further corroborated by the fact that Abraham remains in conference with Jehovah, while the two angels who arrived in the evening at Sodom do not appear to have been spoken of as Jehovah, or to have received Divine honours from Lot. The "man" who (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24</a>) wrestled with Jacob is described afterwards (ver. 30) as "God." The "angel of the Lord" who (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) "appeared" unto Moses "in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush," is immediately afterwards described as Jehovah and Elohim (ver. 4), and, as in the present passage, Moses is instructed to remove his shoe from his foot in consequence of the holiness of the place in which so great a Being appeared. And here we are led to investigate the nature of that mysterious being who is described as "the angel of the Lord," the "angel," or, as the word is sometimes translated, "messenger of the covenant." He appears to Hagar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>), and she immediately proceeds (ver. 13) to express her belief that it is God whom she has seen. The angel who appears to Abraham at the sacrifice of Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11, 12, 18</a>) speaks of Himself as God. The voice of the angel, again, is regarded by Leah and Rachel as the voice of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-11.htm">Genesis 31:11, 16</a>), and He calls Himself so (ver. 13). Jacob speaks of the angel as having "redeemed him from all evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>), but here the term Goel, though it means a ransomer, is not necessarily connected with <span class="accented">moral</span> evil. After His appearance to Hoses in the bush He becomes the special guide of the children of Israel. His divinity is again asserted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, for the Being there spoken of as Jehovah is described in Joshua 14:19 as His angel. The solemn terms in which the God of Israel refers to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20, 21</a> must not be passed over. He is the "Angel of Jehovah." He is sent to "keep" Israel "in the way." They were to take heed and not rebel against Him (so LXX.); for, adds Jehovah, "My name is in His inward parts" (not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> denoting close and intimate union). Cf. ver. 93 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2</a>. This angel is called the Face, or <span class="accented">Faces</span>, of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>), and is thus specially identified with the revelation of Him, like the term <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament. The angel that withstood Balaam assumes a tone of authority in harmony with this view (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22-35</a>). Whether the angel at Bochim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>) were a Divine or human messenger does not appear from the narrative, and the word is occasionally, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>, used of a prophet. But the appearance to Gideon and Manoah has a Divine character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-8.htm">Judges 13:8-22</a>). And the special reference to Jehovah, the angel of the covenant, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> seems to point in a special manner to the Second Person in the Blessed Trinity. This view, as has been stated, is the view of the earlier Fathers, nor does there seem any reasonable ground for its rejection by those of later date. The idea that the Logos, always the medium of the Father's revelation and impartation of Himself, in creation as in redemption, frequently took a visible form under the old dispensation in order to communicate the Divine will to mankind, does not in the least militate against the doctrine of His consubstantiality with the Father. On the contrary, it rather emphasises the fact which the New Testament teaches us throughout, that the Logos was ever the manifestation, the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1.htm">John 1</a>.) of the Father, the eternal medium whereby He communicates Himself beyond Himself. This was in the main the view of the earliest Fathers. They might use an incautious expression now and then, but they ever intended to be true to the doctrine of the Consubstantial Son of the Father, who took a visible shape to convey the Father's mind to man. Thus Justin Martyr ('Dial. cum Tryphone,' 56) cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1, 2</a> to prove that, as he says, "there is another God under (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) the the Creator of all things, who is called an angel because he announces (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) whatever the Creator of all things desires him to announce." This being, he adds, "was also God before the creation of the world." He was another God than the Creator of the world in number (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>), not in mind (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span>). And from the expression "the Lord rained down fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>), he deduces the belief that this Being was "Lord from beside (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) the Lord who is in heaven." He proceeds to cite the passages from the Old Testament which have just been mentioned, and to draw from them the conclusion which has just been drawn, that this Being was one who ministered (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) to God who is above; the word, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> whom He begat before all creation (see. 60, 61). Similarly Theophilus ('Ad Autolycum, 2:22) says that the Word of God held a colloquy with Adam in the person (or representation, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>) of God. Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' 4:7, 4) speaks of the Being who spake to Abraham at Mamre and Moses in the bush as superior to all created angels, and as, in fact, the Word of God; though afterwards (Joshua 20:11) he modifies this statement into a manifestation of "claritatem et dispositiones patris," "secundum dispositionum ejus causas sive efficaciam." It is to be remembered that we unfortunately chiefly possess Irenaeus in a very unsatisfactory Latin dress. Similar passages may be found in Clem., 'Alex. Paed.,' 1:7; and Tertullian, 'Adv. Prax.,' 14. The latter says that God was "invisible as the Father, but visible as the Son," the latter being the means whereby the former was revealed. The passage from Clement is embodied and improved upon in a passage in the 'Apostolic Constitutions,' which presents the primitive doctrine on this point in clearer language than any other. "To Him (Christ) did Moses bear witness, and said, 'The Lord received fire from the Lord, and rained it down.' Him did Jacob see as a man, and said, 'I have seen God face to face, and my soul is preserved.' Him did Abraham entertain, and acknowledge to be the Judge and his Lord. Him did Moses see in the bush. Him did Joshua the son of Nun see, as captain of the Lord's host, for assistance against Jericho" ('Apost. Const.,' 5:20). One passage more will be cited on this point. "Who else," says Origen, in his Homily on this passage, "is the prince of the host of the virtues of the Lord, save our Lord Jesus Christ? .... Joshua would not have adored," he adds, "unless he had recognised God." The fact that the later Fathers (St. Augustine, for instance, and Theodoret, who holds that it was Michael the Archangel who appeared to Joshua) rejected this interpretation would not be sufficient to outweigh primitive testimony at once so explicit and so general, unless it were supported by the strongest arguments. The fact that it was rejected rather from prudential motives, and that such prudence was, in point of fact, entirely unnecessary, robs the later interpretation of much of its weight. Thus much at least is certain, that we may adopt the earlier one without fear of prejudicing thereby the doctrine of the divinity of Christ. Further information on this point will be found in Hengstenberg's 'Christology,' in Liddon's 'Bampton Lectures' (Lect. it.), in Bull ('Defens. Fid. Nicen.,' 1:1), and in Keil's Commentaries upon the various passages of the Old Testament, cited above. "He here appeared as a soldier, with His sword drawn in His hand. To Abraham in his tent He appeared as a traveller; to Joshua in the field, as a man of war. Christ will be to His people what their faith expects and desires" (Matthew Henry). <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua fell on his face.</span> The apparition had no doubt taken Joshua by surprise. He believed himself to be alone, when suddenly he found himself confronted by a warrior, with his sword drawn. Uncertain, in those days when Divine interposition was more common than it is now, whether what he saw was a proof that he was watched by enemies, who had resolved to cut him off by surprise, or whether God had vouchsafed to appear to him, but evidently quite prepared to expect the latter, he addresses a question to the apparition, which of itself implies at least a half belief that what he saw was something above nature. He needs but the simple reply just recorded to lead him to prostrate himself in simple faith before the Mighty One who now stood before him to be the defence and shield of His people from all their adversaries. Maimonides, in his 'Moreh Nevochim,' and others (as, for instance, Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 209) have regarded this as a vision seen by Joshua when he was alone, plunged in deep meditation on the difficult task before him. But without denying that many of the. Divine interpositions recorded in Scripture (as, for instance, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) took place through the inner workings of the mind as the medium of their action, yet here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32.htm">Genesis 32</a>, and most probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>, we have visible appearances of God to men in deep anxiety of heart, pondering "great matters" which were "too high for them." Whether we choose to accept or reject the historical narrative as a whole, there can be no rational ground for doubting that the Hebrew historians wrote under the full persuasion that they and their forefathers lived under a dispensation of continual Divine interpositions, sometimes taking place by secret inward intimations, sometimes through the Urim and Thummim; sometimes, at a crisis in the history of the nation or of an individual, by actual external appearances of God in a visible form, and that we have here an account of one of these. The purport of the appearance is, however, obscured by our present division of chapters. The narrative proceeds without a break as far as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a> is simply parenthetical and explanatory. Thus we gather that Joshua was meditating the plan of his future campaign, and deliberating on the best mode of capturing the strong walled city close by which (ver. 13) he stood, when God appeared to him in the form of a warrior, and solved all his doubts by commanding him to prepare for a miraculous intervention of His Providence, and in the place of warlike expedients to resort to a religious ceremony, which should be the external token to all the surrounding nations that the invading host was under the protection of the Lord of heaven and earth; a fact of which they were more than half convinced by the supernatural passage of the Red Sea and the Jordan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:13-15 We read not of any appearance of God's glory to Joshua till now. There appeared to him one as a man to be noticed. This Man was the Son of God, the eternal Word. Joshua gave him Divine honours: he received them, which a created angel would not have done, and he is called Jehovah, chap. 6:2. To Abraham he appeared as a traveller; to Joshua as a man of war. Christ will be to his people what their faith needs. Christ had his sword drawn, which encouraged Joshua to carry on the war with vigour. Christ's sword drawn in his hand, denotes how ready he is for the defence and salvation of his people. His sword turns every way. Joshua will know whether he is a friend or a foe. The cause between the Israelites and Canaanites, between Christ and Beelzebub, will not admit of any man's refusing to take one part or the other, as he may do in worldly contests. Joshua's inquiry shows an earnest desire to know the will of Christ, and a cheerful readiness and resolution to do it. All true Christians must fight under Christ's banner, and they will conquer by his presence and assistance.</body></html>
