<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-49.htm" title="And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.">Numbers 33:49</a>). Shittim was the last stage of the Exodus under Moses. Probably the sending of these two spies was simultaneous with the issue of the general orders to Israel to prepare for the passage of Jordan within three days. The three days of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-11.htm" title="Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.">Joshua 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-22.htm" title="And they went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.">Joshua 2:22</a> appear to be the same period of time.<p><span class= "bld">Two men to spy.</span>--The sending of these spies should be compared, as to the general effect and character of the measure, with other similar events. There are three instances of sending spies in reference to Canaan--viz., (1) the sending of the twelve by Moses from Kadesh-barnea; (2) the instance before us; (3) the sending of men to view Ai. The present instance is the only one in which the measure had a good effect. In the case of the twelve, Moses describes the action as a manifestation of unbelief. The spies took upon them to discover the right path for Israel to take, a thing which was God's prerogative, not theirs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-22.htm" title="And you came near to me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.">Deuteronomy 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/1-32.htm" title="Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,">Deuteronomy 1:32-33</a>). The men who viewed Ai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.">Joshua 7:2-3</a>) came back and presumed to instruct Joshua how to proceed against it, with disastrous results. In this instance the two men brought back a report of the state of things in Jericho (exactly what they were ordered to do), which encouraged all Israel to proceed. Compare the effect of Gideon and Phurah's visit to the camp of Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-11.htm" title="And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.">Judges 7:11</a>), "Thou shalt hear what they say, and. afterwards shall thine hands be strengthened."<p><span class= "bld">Into an harlot's house, named Rahab.</span>--The attempts to show that Rahab was <span class= "ital">not </span>"an harlot" are not justified by the word used in Hebrew, or in the Greek of the LXX., or in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-31.htm" title="By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.">Hebrews 11:31</a>), or in that of St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-25.htm" title="Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?">James 2:25</a>). But there is no harm in supposing that she was also an innkeeper, which the Targum calls her in every place; indeed, it is very probable that the spies would resort to a place of public entertainment, as most suitable for ascertaining the state of the public mind. How far they were disguised, how they came to be discovered, whether the king of Jericho knew of the impending march of Israel from Shittim, are questions of detail which the narrative leaves unanswered, and which the imagination may discuss at pleasure. The point of the story is not in these.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were.</span>--A falsehood which evidently left no stain on Rahab's conscience, although all falsehood is sin. The same may be said of Jael's slaying Sisera. The Divine standard of sin and holiness never varies; but the standard of man's conscience, even when faith is a dominant principle in the character, may vary to a very considerable degree. In Jesus Christ "all that believe are justified from all things;" but "by the deeds of the law no one. Here, as elsewhere, the application of the law only brings the discovery of sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> -  <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua the son of Nun sent.</span> Rather, as margin, had sent (see note on Joshua 1:2). It might have been at the very time when the command was given to the Israelites, for, according to a common Hebrew manner of speech (see, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-10.htm">1 Samuel 16:10</a>), the three days (ver. 22) may include the whole time spent by the spies in their exploring expedition. Out of Shittim. Literally, <span class="accented">from the valley of acacias.</span> It is so called in full in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>. This place (called Abel-Shittim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-49.htm">Numbers 33:49</a>), in which the Israelites had sojourned for some time (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>; cf. 10. 12:1), seems to have been in the plains (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> see note on Joshua 4:13) of Moab, by Jordan, opposite Jericho" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-48.htm">Numbers 33:48, 49, 50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-13.htm">Numbers 36:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>). It was "the long belt of acacia groves which mark with a line of verdure the upper terraces of the valley." (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 298). The word Abel, or meadow, signifying the long grass with its juicy moisture, points to it as a refreshing place of sojourn and pasture for flocks, after the weary wandering in the wilderness. The acacia, not the <span class="accented">spina AEgyptiaca</span> of the ancients, the <span class="accented">mimosa Nilotica</span> of Linnaeus, but the acacia Seyal, a tree with a golden tuft of blossom, which is still (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 524) to be found on the spot, very hard dark wood, of which much use was made in the tabernacle and its fittings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 26, 36, 37</a>, etc.). The name Abel was a common one in Palestine, and is the same as Abila, from whence comes Abilene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>). We may add that it has nowhere been said that they <span class="accented">were</span> at Shittim. We find this out from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>. This undesigned coincidence is beyond the power of an inventor, and far beyond the power of a compiler who was not only untrustworthy, but so clumsy that he made the most extraordinary blunders in the management of his matter (see note on next verse, and also on Joshua 1:11). <span class="cmt_word">Two men.</span> <span class="accented">Young men</span>, as we are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-23.htm">Joshua 6:23</a>, and therefore active, fleet of foot as well as brave and prudent. All these qualities, as the subsequent narrative shows, were urgently required. "Joshua himself was full of God's Spirit, and had the oracle of God ready for his direction. Yet now he goes, not to the Propitiatorie for consultation, but to the spyes. Except where ordinarie meanes faile us, it is no use appealing to the immediate helpe of God; we may not seek to the posterne, but where the common gate is shut. It was promised Joshua that bee should leade Israel into the promised land, yet hee knew it was unsafe to presume. The condition of his provident care was included in that assurance of successe. Heaven is promised to us, but not to our carelessnesse, infidelitie, disobedience" (Bishop Hall). <span class="cmt_word">Secretly</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">dumbness</span> or <span class="accented">craftiness</span> (the noun being used adverbially), implying the silence and skill required for the task. He who knows how to he silent possesses one at least of the elements of success. The necessity of silence and secrecy may be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>. Keil, however, following the Masoretic punctuation, regards" secretly" as referring to the Israelites, and the spies as sent unknown to the army, that no depressing report might damp their courage. Jericho. "The city of fragrance" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> to breathe, and in the Hiphil, to smell a sweet odour), so called from its situation in the midst of palm trees, from which it was called "the city of palm trees <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-15.htm">2 Chronicles 28:15</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. The vast palm grove, of which relics are even now occasionally washed up from the Red Sea, preserved by the salt in its acrid waters, has now disappeared. We read of it as still existing in the twelfth century, and indeed traces of it were to be seen as late as 1838. A dirty and poverty-stricken village called Riha, or Eriha, is all that now marks the site of all these glories of nature and art, and the most careful researches have until lately failed to discover any remains of the ancient city. It is doubtful whether the ruins observed by Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 216) are not the ruins of soma later city, built in the neighbourhood. Bartlett, p. 452, believes Riha to be the site of the later Jericho of our Lord's day, but Tristram would, with less probability, identify Riha with Gilgal. They both, however, place the site of ancient Jericho about a mile and a half from Riha. Conder thinks its true position is at the fountain Ain-es-Sultan. Lenormant, in his 'Manual of Oriental History,' remarks on the skill of Joshua as a military tactician. Whether he followed the advice of his experienced leader, or whether we are to attribute his success to special guidance from above, he certainly displayed the qualities of a consummate general. "Jericho," says Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 805), "stands at the entrance of the main passes from the valley of the Jordan into the interior of Palestine, the one branching off to the southwest towards Olivet, the other to the northwest towards Michmash, which commands the approach to Ai and Bethel. It was thus the key of Palestine to any invader from this quarter." He illustrates by <span class="accented">Chiavenna</span> (or the key city, from its situation), in Italy. Lenormant remarks that from an ordinary historical point of view the strategy of Joshua is worth notice. It was the practice ever followed by Napoleon, and, he adds, by Nelson also, to divide his enemies, and crush them in detail. Had Joshua advanced upon Palestine from the south, each success, as it alarmed, would have also united the various communities of the land, under their separate kings, by the sense of a common danger. Thus each onward step would have increased his difficulties, and exposed him, exhausted by continued efforts, to the assaults of fresh and also more numerous enemies, in a country which grew ever more easy to defend and more perilous to attack. But by crossing the Jordan and marching at once upon Jericho, he was enabled, after the capture of that city, to fall with his whole force first upon the cities of the south, and then on those of the north. The political condition of Palestine at that time (see Introduction) did not permit of a resistance by the whole force of the country under a single leader. A hasty confederation of the kings of the south, after the treaty with Gibeon, was overthrown by the rapid advance of Joshua and the battle of Beth-boron. By this success he was free to march with his whole army northward, against the confederation of tribes under the leadership of the king of Hazor, whom he overcame in the decisive battle of Merom. There is no hint given in the Scripture that in this strategy Joshua acted under the special guidance of the Most High. The probability is, that in this, as in all other of God's purposes effected through the agency of man, there is a mixture of the Divine and human elements, and that man's individuality is selected and guided as an instrument of God's purpose, which, in this instance, was the chastisement of the Canaanitish people, and the gift of the Holy Land as a possession to the descendants of Abraham. That Joshua was not indifferent to human means is shown by this very verse. <span class="cmt_word">Into a harlots house.</span> Many commentators have striven to show that this word simply means an innkeeper, an office which, as Dr. Adam Clarke proves at length, was often filled by a woman. It has been derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> to nourish, a root also found in the Syriac. The Chaldee paraphast and many Jewish and Christian interpreters have adopted this interpretation, in order, as Rosenmuller remarks, "to absolve her from whom Christ had His origin from the crime of prostitution." But St. Matthew seems to imply the very opposite. The genealogy there contained mentions, as though of set purpose, all the blots on the lineage of Christ as was fitting in setting forth the origin of Him who came to forgive sin. Only three women are there mentioned: Tamar, who was guilty of incest; Rahab, the harlot; and Ruth, the Moabitess. And the LXX. render by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. Calvin calls the interpretation "innkeeper" a "presumptuous wresting of Scripture." Hengstenberg ('Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 197) also rejects the interpretation "innkeeper," and maintains the right of the spies, who, he says, were no doubt chosen by Joshua for their good character, to enter a wicked woman's house for a good purpose. It does not appear that the spies entered the house of Rahab with any evil intent, but simply because to enter the house of a woman of that kind - and women of that kind must have been very numerous in the licentious Phoenician cities - would have attracted far less attention than if they had entered any other. Even there it did not escape the notice of the king, who had been thoroughly alarmed (ver. 3) by the successes of Israel eastward of Jordan. Origen, in his third homily on Joshua, remarks that, "As the first Jesus sent his spies before him and they were received into the harlot's house, so the second Jesus sent His forerunners, whom the publicans and harlots gladly received." <span class="cmt_word">Named Rahab.</span> Origen (Hom. 3) sees in this name, which signifies <span class="accented">room</span> (see Rehoboth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>), the type of the Church of Christ which extends throughout the world, and receives sinners. <span class="cmt_word">And lodged there.</span> Literally, and <span class="accented">lay</span> there, perhaps with the idea of lying hid, for they did not (ver. 15) spend the night there. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 Faith in God's promises ought not to do away, but to encourage our diligence in the use of proper means. The providence of God directed the spies to the house of Rahab. God knew where there was one that would be true to them, though they did not. Rahab appears to have been an innkeeper; and if she had formerly been one of bad life, which is doubtful, she had left her evil courses. That which seems to us most accidental, is often overruled by the Divine providence to serve great ends. It was by faith that Rahab received those with peace, against whom her king and country had war. We are sure this was a good work; it is so spoken of by the apostle, Jas 2:25; and she did it by faith, such a faith as set her above the fear of man. Those only are true believers, who find in their hearts to venture for God; they take his people for their people, and cast in their lot among them. The spies were led by the special providence of God, and Rahab entertained them out of regard to Israel and Israel's God, and not for lucre or for any evil purpose. Though excuses may be offered for the guilt of Rahab's falsehood, it seems best to admit nothing which tends to explain it away. Her views of the Divine law must have been very dim: a falsehood like this, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, whatever the motive, would deserve heavy censure.</body></html>
