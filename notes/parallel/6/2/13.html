She was in no way separated or degraded from their society. When we remember what Moses describes the Canaanites to have been (in certain passages of the Pentateuch, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/18-24.htm" title="Defile not you yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:">Leviticus 18:24-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/20-22.htm" title="You shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, where I bring you to dwell therein, spew you not out.">Leviticus 20:22-23</a>) and compare this chapter, we may reasonably conclude Rahab to have been morally not inferior to her countrymen as they were then, but rather their superior. We are reminded that the "publicans and harlots "were not the worst members of the "evil and adulterous generation" to whom the Word of God came. They believed John the Baptist, and were among the most constant hearers of the true Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-32.htm" title="For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and you, when you had seen it, repented not afterward, that you might believe him.">Matthew 21:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-1.htm" title="Then drew near to him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.">Luke 15:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-21 Rahab had heard of the miracles the Lord wrought for Israel. She believed that his promises would certainly be fulfilled, and his threatenings take effect; and that there was no way of escape but by submitting to him, and joining with his people. The conduct of Rahab proved that she had the real principle of Divine faith. Observe the promises the spies made to her. The goodness of God is often expressed by his kindness and truth, Ps 117:2; in both these we must be followers of him. Those who will be conscientious in keeping promises, are cautious in making them. The spies make needful conditions. The scarlet cord, like the blood upon the doorpost at the passover, recalls to remembrance the sinner's security under the atoning blood of Christ; and that we are to flee thereto for refuge from the wrath of a justly offended God. The same cord Rahab used for the saving of these Israelites, was to be used for her own safety. What we serve and honour God with, we may expect he will bless, and make useful to us.</body></html>
