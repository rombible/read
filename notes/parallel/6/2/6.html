"Two strangers, Israelites, spies, have a safe harbour provided them, even amongst their enemies, against the proclamation of a king." "Where cannot the God of heaven either find or raise up friends to His own causes and servants?" (Bp. Hall.) <span class="cmt_word">To the roof of the house.</span> The flat roofs of Oriental, and even of Greek and Italian houses, are used for all kinds of purposes, especially for drying corn and other things for domestic use (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>. Also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>, where the roof is used as a place of retirement and repose). <span class="cmt_word">Stalks of flax.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">flax of the tree.</span> The word translated flax either of the raw material or of the linen made from it. Here it must mean flax as it came cut from the field; that is, as our version translates it, the stalks of flax (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.), which grows in Egypt to a height of three feet, and may be presumed to have attained a height not much less at Jericho. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> which signifies <span class="accented">to lay in a row</span>, and is used of the wood on the altar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>, and of the shew bread in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>, confirms this view. It is obvious that this would have formed a most sufficient hiding place for the fugitives. "Either faith or friendship are not tried but in extremities. To show countenance to the messengers of God while the publique face of the State smiles upon them, is but a courtesie of course; but to hide our own lives in theirs when they are persecuted is an act which looks for a reward" (Bp. Hall). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 Faith in God's promises ought not to do away, but to encourage our diligence in the use of proper means. The providence of God directed the spies to the house of Rahab. God knew where there was one that would be true to them, though they did not. Rahab appears to have been an innkeeper; and if she had formerly been one of bad life, which is doubtful, she had left her evil courses. That which seems to us most accidental, is often overruled by the Divine providence to serve great ends. It was by faith that Rahab received those with peace, against whom her king and country had war. We are sure this was a good work; it is so spoken of by the apostle, Jas 2:25; and she did it by faith, such a faith as set her above the fear of man. Those only are true believers, who find in their hearts to venture for God; they take his people for their people, and cast in their lot among them. The spies were led by the special providence of God, and Rahab entertained them out of regard to Israel and Israel's God, and not for lucre or for any evil purpose. Though excuses may be offered for the guilt of Rahab's falsehood, it seems best to admit nothing which tends to explain it away. Her views of the Divine law must have been very dim: a falsehood like this, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, whatever the motive, would deserve heavy censure.</body></html>
