One near Jericho (cf, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-16.htm">2 Samuel 19:16, 19, 39</a>); one at Bethsean, now Beisan, leading to Succoth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>. See Robinson, ' Biblical Researches' 2:497; Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine'); beside others not mentioned in Scripture. A vivid description of the crossing the Jordan at the fords near Jericho is to be found in Tristrain's 'Land of Israel,' p. 520. The ford is almost certainly the one mentioned here, since an hour or two's ride brought the party to Shittim. These fords were easy to cross save when the Jordan, as was now the case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>), overflowed its banks. This may have been the reason why the pursuers did not cross the fords, but they pursued the spies to the fords, hoping to find their retreat cut off. This is rendered more probable by the fact (ver. 22) that the pursuers appear to have continued their search after leaving the fords. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 Faith in God's promises ought not to do away, but to encourage our diligence in the use of proper means. The providence of God directed the spies to the house of Rahab. God knew where there was one that would be true to them, though they did not. Rahab appears to have been an innkeeper; and if she had formerly been one of bad life, which is doubtful, she had left her evil courses. That which seems to us most accidental, is often overruled by the Divine providence to serve great ends. It was by faith that Rahab received those with peace, against whom her king and country had war. We are sure this was a good work; it is so spoken of by the apostle, Jas 2:25; and she did it by faith, such a faith as set her above the fear of man. Those only are true believers, who find in their hearts to venture for God; they take his people for their people, and cast in their lot among them. The spies were led by the special providence of God, and Rahab entertained them out of regard to Israel and Israel's God, and not for lucre or for any evil purpose. Though excuses may be offered for the guilt of Rahab's falsehood, it seems best to admit nothing which tends to explain it away. Her views of the Divine law must have been very dim: a falsehood like this, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, whatever the motive, would deserve heavy censure.</body></html>
