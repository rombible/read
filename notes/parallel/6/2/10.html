Whether this name were known to her or not, she knew what was signified by it, the one only self-existent God (since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> is clearly derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to <span class="accented">be</span>), the Author of all things, visible and invisible (see ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">The Red Sea.</span> Brugsch, in his 'History of Egypt,' denies that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> should be rendered 'Red Sea,' and affirms that this error of the LXX. interpreters has been the source of endless misapprehensions. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> is an Egyptian word signifying flags or rushes, which abound not only in the Red Sea, but in the marshes on the shores of the Mediterranean, as, in fact, in all low-lying lands. It is here, according to Brugsch, in a treacherous and well-nigh impassable country, near that Serbonian bog, "where armies whole have sunk" (Milton, 'Paradise Lost,' Book H., line 594), that we are to look for the victorious passage of <span class="accented">Moses</span>, and the destruction of Pharaoh and his host. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> or rushes were to be found in the Nile, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-9.htm">Exodus 2:9, 5</a> shows (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>). So that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> by no means necessarily implies the Red Sea. Yet on the other hand we may remember, with the Edinburgh Reviewer (July, 1879), that the coastline of Palestine and of the delta of the Nile has undergone considerable changes during the historic period, and that the land has, during that period, largely encroached on the sea. <span class="cmt_word">Sihon and Og.</span> As we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2.htm">Deuteronomy 2, 3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye utterly destroyed.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">devoted to utter destruction</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>). Rahab seems to be aware that the extermination of these nations was in fulfilment of a Divine sentence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-21 Rahab had heard of the miracles the Lord wrought for Israel. She believed that his promises would certainly be fulfilled, and his threatenings take effect; and that there was no way of escape but by submitting to him, and joining with his people. The conduct of Rahab proved that she had the real principle of Divine faith. Observe the promises the spies made to her. The goodness of God is often expressed by his kindness and truth, Ps 117:2; in both these we must be followers of him. Those who will be conscientious in keeping promises, are cautious in making them. The spies make needful conditions. The scarlet cord, like the blood upon the doorpost at the passover, recalls to remembrance the sinner's security under the atoning blood of Christ; and that we are to flee thereto for refuge from the wrath of a justly offended God. The same cord Rahab used for the saving of these Israelites, was to be used for her own safety. What we serve and honour God with, we may expect he will bless, and make useful to us.</body></html>
