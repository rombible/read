Perhaps, indeed, they selected it for this reason, as it enabled them to leave the town without passing the gate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then she let them down.</span> The conversation which is related afterwards, no doubt occurred afterwards, as is proved by the use of the perfect <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> in ver. 18. There is no reason to suppose the window by which she let them down. to have been so distant from the ground as to preclude a conversation, and it is quite possible that Rahab's house may have been in a situation in which such a conversation could be carried on without interruption. There are continental cities now surrounded by walls, in which such a conversation would involve no difficulty whatever, especially if the house from which such a conversation was carried on happened to stand a little apart from other houses. And though the spies sent by Moses described the walls of the Phoenician cities in hyperbolical language, it is highly improbable that their fortifications were stronger than those of mediaeval times. The little town of Ahrweiler, in the valley of the Ahr, near Remagen, may serve as an instance in point. It would once have been called a strongly fortified town, but the walls are of no great height, and the houses are built upon them. The same may be seen at Bacharach and Oberwesel, and other well known places where the fortifications have not been modernised. With the escape of the spies we may compare the escape of St. Paul from Damascus, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32, 33</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-21 Rahab had heard of the miracles the Lord wrought for Israel. She believed that his promises would certainly be fulfilled, and his threatenings take effect; and that there was no way of escape but by submitting to him, and joining with his people. The conduct of Rahab proved that she had the real principle of Divine faith. Observe the promises the spies made to her. The goodness of God is often expressed by his kindness and truth, Ps 117:2; in both these we must be followers of him. Those who will be conscientious in keeping promises, are cautious in making them. The spies make needful conditions. The scarlet cord, like the blood upon the doorpost at the passover, recalls to remembrance the sinner's security under the atoning blood of Christ; and that we are to flee thereto for refuge from the wrath of a justly offended God. The same cord Rahab used for the saving of these Israelites, was to be used for her own safety. What we serve and honour God with, we may expect he will bless, and make useful to us.</body></html>
