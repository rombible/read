Note the fulfilment of the prophetic song of Moses, which is partly repeated here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-15.htm" title="Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold on them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.">Exodus 15:15-16</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/2-9.htm" title="And she said to the men, I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.">Joshua 2:9-11</a>), "All the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away; fear and dread shall fall upon them." But especially observe the expression of Rahab's own belief, <span class= "ital">"</span>Jehovah, your God, He is God in heaven above and in earth beneath." Did the faith of the men of Israel go much further than this? Did it always go so far? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm" title="And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.">1Kings 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jonah/1-9.htm" title="And he said to them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which has made the sea and the dry land.">Jonah 1:9-10</a>). The prophets themselves could not assert much more. The greatest of them were satisfied if they could bring the people of Israel to acknowledge this. Rahab's confession is also one of a series. The Egyptians, Philistines, Syrians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, were all in turn brought to the same acknowledgment by their contact with Israel. The reason is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-24.htm" title="That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that you might fear the LORD your God for ever.">Joshua 4:24</a>, "That all the people of the earth may know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath given.</span> Rahab's faith is shown by this expression. What God willed she regarded as already done. To speak of the future as of a past already fulfilled is the usual language of the Hebrew prophets. <span class="cmt_word">Faint,</span> Literally, <span class="accented">melt</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15, 16</a>, which is thus shown to be not poetic license, but sober fact. For we may take the future in the passage just cited as a present, and translate, "All the inhabitants of Canaan melt away; fear and dread are falling upon them" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-21 Rahab had heard of the miracles the Lord wrought for Israel. She believed that his promises would certainly be fulfilled, and his threatenings take effect; and that there was no way of escape but by submitting to him, and joining with his people. The conduct of Rahab proved that she had the real principle of Divine faith. Observe the promises the spies made to her. The goodness of God is often expressed by his kindness and truth, Ps 117:2; in both these we must be followers of him. Those who will be conscientious in keeping promises, are cautious in making them. The spies make needful conditions. The scarlet cord, like the blood upon the doorpost at the passover, recalls to remembrance the sinner's security under the atoning blood of Christ; and that we are to flee thereto for refuge from the wrath of a justly offended God. The same cord Rahab used for the saving of these Israelites, was to be used for her own safety. What we serve and honour God with, we may expect he will bless, and make useful to us.</body></html>
