This, however, need not of necessity be imputed to them as a sin. For, as we have seen, the conquest was to be gradual. No doubt there was enough to be done in consolidating the conquests already made, in settling the tribes in their possessions, to occupy all the days of Joshua, and even possibly a longer period. At least we may he sure that, as long as Joshua lived, the heathen settlements were kept distinct from the Israelitish community, that intermarriages were not allowed, nor rights of citizenship granted to any but the Gibeonites. <span class="cmt_word">Cut off.</span> Joshua's speech here exactly agrees with the statements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11, 14, 21</a>. Here at least, if Joshua's speech and the history were taken from two different sources, neither of them precisely accurate, the first postulate of the destructive criticism, we might have expected some slight discrepancy. But Joshua uses a word which implies total extermination, a feature, be it observed, of the campaigns of Moses and Joshua only, and not of the later Israelitish history. <span class="cmt_word">Westward</span>.

He put them in mind of the great things God had done for them in his days. He exhorted them to be very courageous. Keep with care, do with diligence, and regard with sincerity what is written. Also, very cautiously to endeavour that the heathen idolatry may be forgotten, so that it may never be revived. It is sad that among Christians the names of the heathen gods are so commonly used, and made so familiar as they are. Joshua exhorts them to be very constant. There might be many things amiss among them, but they had not forsaken the Lord their God; the way to make people better, is to make the best of them.</body></html>
