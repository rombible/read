The snare or <span class="accented">pach</span> was evidently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>) laid upon the earth; but there is no evidence for Gesenius' idea that the <span class="accented">mokesh</span> which follows, there as here, means the stick of the trap, which when displaced involved the bird in the net. As the primary signification of this latter word, which is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> a bow, seems to mean something curved, it is probably a noose or springe. And the word and its cognates are used of involving, or catching, people by its use. Furst's Lexicon confirms this view, which has been independently arrived at. <span class="cmt_word">Scourges</span>. The Hebrew word is in the singular. It is translated <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, nails, in the LXX., and <span class="accented">offendiculum in the</span> Vulgate. <span class="cmt_word">In your sides.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">on</span> your sides. The words here are very similar to those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. Moses, however, does but use two of the similes of which here we have four. He has, moreover, a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) for thorns, and the word here translated thorns is there substituted for scourges; "thorns in your sides." Joshua crowds together his similes "to describe the shame, and trouble, and oppression which they would bring upon themselves by joining in the idolatry of the Canaanites" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord your God.</span> Here, as elsewhere in this and many other passages, we have in the original, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> your God. It is important to remember that the sacred writer is calling the God of Israel by His own proper name, that by which He was distinguished from the gods of the nations round about. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:11-16 Would we cleave to the Lord, we must always stand upon our guard, for many a soul is lost through carelessness. Love the Lord your God, and you will not leave him. Has God been thus true to you? Be not you false to him. He is faithful that has promised, Heb 10:23. The experience of every Christian witnesses the same truth. Conflicts may have been severe and long, trials great and many; but at the last he will acknowledge that goodness and mercy followed him all the days of his life. Joshua states the fatal consequences of going back; know for a certainty it will be your ruin. The first step would be, friendship with idolaters; the next would be, marrying with them; the end of that would be, serving their gods. Thus the way of sin is down-hill, and those who have fellowship with sinners, cannot avoid having fellowship with sin. He describes the destruction he warns them of. The goodness of the heavenly Canaan, and the free and sure grant God has made of it, will add to the misery of those who shall for ever be shut out from it. Nothing will make them see how wretched they are, so much, as to see how happy they might have been. Let us watch and pray against temptation. Let us trust in God's faithfulness, love, and power; let us plead his promises, and cleave to his commandments, then we shall be happy in life, in death, and for ever.</body></html>
