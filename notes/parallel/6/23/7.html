It must always be remembered that, in proposing the extermination of the seven nations, Jehovah reserved to Himself the ordering of the details of the conquest and extermination. When the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them." He did not propose to deliver them all to Israel at once, for reasons set forth in Judges 2, 3. Meantime, it was a trial of Israel's faith and obedience to live among idolaters without making any peace with them, or lending any countenance to their idolatry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye come not among these nations</span> (see note on ver. 4). We can here perceive that the Israelites, though living among these nations, held no intercourse with them. <span class="cmt_word">Neither make mention of the name of their gods.</span> Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>, which however is not a verbal quotation of this passage. The LXX. here has, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>; the Vulgate simply, "ne juretis in nomine deorum earum." The Hebrew has the signification <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to bring to remembrance, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to praise or celebrate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The former is the better idea here, "let them not be named among you, as becometh saints," let them be quite forgotten, as though they had never been heard of; and this not with a purely theological, but with an ethical purpose, since "fornication and all uncleanness and greediness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>) were the first principles of their rites (see Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">Nor cause to swear by them.</span> These words are found in connection with what follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>. So with "serve" and "bow down" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, etc.). Here again we have Joshua quoting Deuteronomy as the book of the Law of Moses. According to the "Deuteronomist" theory, the quotation is an audacious fiction, manufactured by the person who was at that moment forging the book from which he pretended to quote. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-10 Joshua was old and dying, let them observe what he said now. He put them in mind of the great things God had done for them in his days. He exhorted them to be very courageous. Keep with care, do with diligence, and regard with sincerity what is written. Also, very cautiously to endeavour that the heathen idolatry may be forgotten, so that it may never be revived. It is sad that among Christians the names of the heathen gods are so commonly used, and made so familiar as they are. Joshua exhorts them to be very constant. There might be many things amiss among them, but they had not forsaken the Lord their God; the way to make people better, is to make the best of them.</body></html>
