Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.">Joshua 9:17</a>. Their deception of Joshua and the Israelites on this occasion is a curious compensation for what was done by Simeon and Levi to the Hivites long before, when Jacob first came to Shechem from Padan-Aram (see Genesis 34). On that occasion, the inhabitants of a single city of the Hivites were put to the sword by Israel, by means of a stratagem; on this occasion, a stratagem saved four Hivite cities from destruction by Israel's sword.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Gibeon.</span> That is, of a confederation of cities (see ver. 17), of which Gibeon was the head. Gibeon was a city of some importance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). Though it was for size and importance "as one of the royal cities," we hear nothing of a king there. Hengstenberg, in his history, describes it (p. 227) as "eine freie Stadt," with daughter cities dependent on it. In fact, the Phoenician cities (see Introduction) seem to have had as great a variety of constitution as those of ancient Greece. Its inhabitants were Hivites (ver. 7, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>). Its name (compare Gibeah and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> a hill) signifies hill city, like the termination <span class="accented">dunum</span> in Latin, as Lugdunum, or Lyons; <span class="accented">dune</span> in Anglo-Saxon, as <span class="accented">Ethandune.</span> Compare also Dunkirk. Robinson, in his 'Biblical Researches,' 2:135-9, identifies it with el-Jib, a village on an eminence in the midst of a fertile plain, where the remains of large buildings may still be seen. (So Vandevelde and Condor.) "Onely the Hivites are wiser than their fellowes, and will rather yeeld and live. Their intelligence was not diverse from the rest; all had equally heard of the miraculous conduct and successe of Israel; but their resolution was diverse. As Rahab saved her family in the midst of Jericho, so these foure cities preserved themselves in the midst of Canaan; and both of them by beleeving what God would do. The efficacie of God's marvellous works is not in the acts themselves, but in our apprehension" (Bp. Hall). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:3-13 Other people heard these tidings, and were driven thereby to make war upon Israel; but the Gibeonites were led to make peace with them. Thus the discovery of the glory and the grace of God in the gospel, is to some a savour of life unto life, but to others a savour of death unto death, 2Co 2:16. The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. The falsehood of the Gibeonites cannot be justified. We must not do evil that good may themselves to the God of Israel, we have reason to think Joshua would have been directed by the oracle of God to spare their lives. But when they had once said, We are come from a far country, they were led to say it made of skins, and their clothes: one lie brings on another, and that a third, and so on. The way of that sin is especially down-hill. Yet their faith and prudence are to be commended. In submitting to Israel they submitted to the God of Israel, which implied forsaking their idolatries. And how can we do better than cast ourselves upon the mercy of a God of all goodness? The way to avoid judgment is to meet it by repentance. Let us do like these Gibeonites, seek peace with God in the rags of abasement, and godly sorrow; so our sin shall not be our ruin. Let us be servants to Jesus, our blessed Joshua, and we shall live.</body></html>
