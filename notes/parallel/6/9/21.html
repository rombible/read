See Keil <span class="accented">in loc.</span> for the force of the Vau conversive. The LXX. and Vulgate render as our version. <span class="cmt_word">Hewers of wood and drawers of water.</span> Some amount of casuistry has been displayed upon this passage. But the fairness of the proceeding seems clear enough. The Gibeonites had escaped death by a fraud. For that fraud they deserved punishment. Their lives were spared by virtue of a solemn oath. But equality of rights had never been promised them. They might think themselves well off if they escaped destruction, even though they might be condemned permanently to occupy a servile condition. They appear to have assisted at the tabernacle worship, since they were condemned to serve, not individual Israelites, but the congregation. Such was the office of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (Nethinhim <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the given or devoted) in the later history of Judah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43-54, 58, 70</a>; and Ezra 8:20. See also Drusius and Masius <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The latter discusses the question whether the Nethinim were really the Gibeonites, or whether David, as stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-20.htm">Ezra 8:20</a>, instituted a new order of persons to take their place. If the latter were the case, then we have a proof that the Book of Joshua was written anterior to the time of David. It seems quite possible that Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>) had all but exterminated the Gibeonites, and that David was compelled to institute a new order in their stead. If this suggestion be correct, and it is far from improbable, we have here an undesigned coincidence strongly supporting the credit of the narrative, in the place of Knobel's insinuation, contained in the words, that "the Elohist in Saul's time gives no hint of this, although he took the greatest interest in the persons engaged in God's service." <span class="cmt_word">As the princes had promised them.</span> These words as they stand are unintelligible. No such promise had been given. The literal rendering is "as the princes" (see note on ver. 15) "said to them," by the mouth of Joshua, as recorded in ver. 23. The Syriac Version supplies some words here to make up for a supposed deficiency in the text. But this is not necessary. The repetition in vers. 23 and 27 is quite in the manner of the historian. Nor are the words "as the princes said to them" explicable on the supposition that the words after, "let them live," are the words of the princes (see note above). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joshua/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:14-21 The Israelites, having examined the provisions of the Gibeonites, hastily concluded that they confirmed their account. We make more haste than good speed, when we stay not to take God with us, and do not consult him by the word and prayer. The fraud was soon found out. A lying tongue is but for a moment. Had the oath been in itself unlawful, it would not have been binding; for no obligation can render it our duty to commit a sin. But it was not unlawful to spare the Canaanites who submitted, and left idolatry, desiring only that their lives might be spared. A citizen of Zion swears to his own hurt, and changes not, Ps 15:4. Joshua and the princes, when they found that they had been deceived, did not apply to Eleazar the high priest to be freed from their engagement, much less did they pretend that no faith is to be kept with those to whom they had sworn. Let this convince us how we ought to keep our promises, and make good our bargains; and what conscience we ought to make of our words.</body></html>
