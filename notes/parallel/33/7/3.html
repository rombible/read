This clause and the rest of the verse are very obscure Cheyne supposes the text to be corrupt. Henderson renders, "For evil their hands are well prepared;" so virtually Hitzig, Pusey, and the Septuagint. Caspari agrees rather with the Vulgate (<span class="accented">Malum manuum suarum dicunt bonum</span>)," Hands are (busy) upon evil to make (it seem) good," which looks to that extremity of iniquity when men "call evil good, and good evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). The general meaning is that they are ready enough to do evil, and, as the next clause says, can be bribed to do anything. <span class="cmt_word">The prince asketh;</span> makes some nefarious demand of the judge, some perversion of justice at his hands, as in the case of Naboth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The judge asketh</span> (<span class="accented">is ready</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for a reward.</span> The judge is willing to do what the prince wishes, if he is bribed for it. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "The judge speaks words of peace" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He uttereth his mischievous desire;</span> or, <span class="accented">the mischief of his soul.</span> The rich man speaks out unblushingly the evil that he has conceived in his heart, the wicked design which he meditates. <span class="cmt_word">So they wrap it up;</span> better, <span class="accented">and they weave it together.</span> The prince, the judge, and the rich man weave their evil plan together, to make it strong and right in others' eyes. The passage is altered in meaning by a different grouping of the Hebrew letters, thus: "The prince demandeth (a reward) to do good; and the judge, for the recompense of a great man, uttereth what he himself desireth. And they entangle the good more than briars, and the righteous more than a thorn hedge." The LXX. carries on the sense to the next verse, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "And I will destroy their goods as a consuming moth." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 The prophet bemoans himself that he lived among a people ripening apace for ruin, in which many good persons would suffer. Men had no comfort, no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations. Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom of universal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but in looking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation. When under trials, we should look continually to our Divine Redeemer, that we may have strength and grace to trust in him, and to be examples to those around us.</body></html>
