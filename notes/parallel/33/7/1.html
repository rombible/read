As the early fig gathered in June is eagerly sought for by the traveller, so the prophet sought anxiously for a good man; but his experience was that of the Psalmist: "The godly man ceaseth; the faithful fail from among the children of men."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> &sect; 5. <span class="accented">Israel's penitential acknowledgment of the general corruption.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe is me!</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>). Micah threatens no more; he represents repentant Israel confessing its corruption and lamenting the necessity of punishment. <span class="cmt_word">I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I am as the gatherings of the fruit harvest.</span> The point of comparison is only to be inferred from the context. At the fruit. harvest no early figs are to be found, and (in the next clause) after the vintage no more grapes; so in Israel there is none righteous left. The Septuagint gives a plainer exposition, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I became as one that gathereth straw in harvest;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Factus sum sicut qui collegit in autumno racemos vindimiae</span>, joining the two clauses together. My soul desired the first ripe fruit; better, <span class="accented">nor</span> <span class="accented">early fig which my soul desired.</span> The holiness and grace of more primitive times are wholly absent from this later period (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, where a similar figure is used; compare also Christ's dealing with the barren fig tree, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-18.htm">Matthew 21:18</a>, etc.). The first ripe figs were proverbially sweet and good (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>; and Hosea, <span class="accented">loc cit</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 The prophet bemoans himself that he lived among a people ripening apace for ruin, in which many good persons would suffer. Men had no comfort, no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations. Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom of universal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but in looking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation. When under trials, we should look continually to our Divine Redeemer, that we may have strength and grace to trust in him, and to be examples to those around us.</body></html>
