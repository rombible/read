"Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm" title="And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; on your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life:">Genesis 3:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall lick the dust like a serpent</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>). The enemies of God's people "shall lick the dust" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>), shall be reduced to the utmost degradation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall move out of their holes,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">they come trembling out of their close places</span> (or, <span class="accented">fastnesses</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-46.htm">Psalm 18:46</a>), <span class="accented">like crawling things of the earth</span>. They who prided themselves on their security shall come forth from their strongholds in utter fear, driven out like snakes from their lairs (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-11.htm">Psalm 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be afraid of</span> (<span class="accented">whine with fear unto</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Lord our God.</span> They shall be driven by terror to acknowledge the God of Israel. The expression is ambiguous, and may mean servile fear, which makes a man shrink from God. or that fear. which is one step towards repentance; the latter seems intended here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, where, as Pusey says, the words, "and his goodness," determine the character of the fear. <span class="cmt_word">Because of</span> (or, <span class="accented">before</span>) <span class="cmt_word">thee</span>. It is the heathen who are still the subject, not the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-7.htm">Jeremiah 10:7</a>). The sudden change of persons is quite in the prophet's style. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-20 When God is about to deliver his people, he stirs up their friends to pray for them. Apply spiritually the prophet's prayer to Christ, to take care of his church, as the great Shepherd of the sheep, and to go before them, while they are here in this world as in a wood, in this world but not of it. God promises in answer to this prayer, he will do that for them which shall be repeating the miracles of former ages. As their sin brought them into bondage, so God's pardoning their sin brought them out. All who find pardoning mercy, cannot but wonder at that mercy; we have reason to stand amazed, if we know what it is. When the Lord takes away the guilt of sin, that it may not condemn us, he will break the power of sin, that it may not have dominion over us. If left to ourselves, our sins will be too hard for us; but God's grace shall be sufficient to subdue them, so that they shall not rule us, and then they shall not ruin us. When God forgives sin, he takes care that it never shall be remembered any more against the sinner. He casts their sins into the sea; not near the shore-side, where they may appear again, but into the depth of the sea, never to rise again. All their sins shall be cast there, for when God forgives sin, he forgives all. He will perfect that which concerns us, and with this good work will do all for us which our case requires, and which he has promised. These engagements relate to Christ, and the success of the gospel to the end of time, the future restoration of Israel, and the final prevailing of true religion in all lands. The Lord will perform his truth and mercy, not one jot or tittle of it shall fall to the ground: faithful is He that has promised, who also will do it. Let us remember that the Lord has given the security of his covenant, for strong consolation to all who flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
