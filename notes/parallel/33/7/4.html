In punishment of all this corruption, the prophet points to the day of judgment. <span class="cmt_word">The day of thy watchmen.</span> The day of retribution foretold by the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>). And (<span class="accented">even</span>) <span class="cmt_word">thy visitation;</span> in apposition with the day, the time, and explanatory of punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Cometh</span>; is come - the perfect tense denoting the certainty of the future event. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "Woe! thy vengeance is come." <span class="cmt_word">Now shall be their perplexity.</span> When this day of the Lord comes, there shall be confusion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>); it shall bring chastise ment before deliverance. The prophet here, as elsewhere, changes from the second to the third person, speaking of the people gene rally.

Pusey notes the paronomasia here. They were as bad as a thorn hedge (<span class="accented">merucah</span>); they shall fall into perplexity (<span class="accented">mebucah</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 The prophet bemoans himself that he lived among a people ripening apace for ruin, in which many good persons would suffer. Men had no comfort, no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations. Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom of universal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but in looking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation. When under trials, we should look continually to our Divine Redeemer, that we may have strength and grace to trust in him, and to be examples to those around us.</body></html>
