The gracious character here ascribed to Jehovah is unparalleled in the Bible in human utterances; it is the response of the prophet to the glorious words spoken by Jehovah of Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-6.htm" title="And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The promise there made to Moses is here extended by the inspiration of the prophet to the Gentiles. The "remnant" refers to the returned from the captivity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - &sect; 8. <span class="accented">The book ends</span> <span class="accented">with a lyric ode in praise of God's mercy and faithfulness.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - In view of the many provocations and backslidings of the people, Micah is filled with wonder at the goodness and long suffering of God. <span class="cmt_word">Who is a God like unto thee?</span> The question seems to recall the prophet's own name, which means, "Who is like Jehovah?" and the clause in Moses' song (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>), "Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?" Such comparisons are made from the standpoint of the nations who believe in the real existence of their false gods. <span class="cmt_word">That pardoneth iniquty</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Passeth by the transgression;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "passing over iniquities;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">transis peccatum.</span> To pass by, or pass over, is to forgive, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-8.htm">Amos 7:8</a>. There is probably an allusion, as Jerome says, to the night of the Exodus. As the destroying angel passed over the Israelites and destroyed them not, so God spares his people, imputing not their iniquities unto them. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6, 7</a>).

Wisd. 11:24). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-20 When God is about to deliver his people, he stirs up their friends to pray for them. Apply spiritually the prophet's prayer to Christ, to take care of his church, as the great Shepherd of the sheep, and to go before them, while they are here in this world as in a wood, in this world but not of it. God promises in answer to this prayer, he will do that for them which shall be repeating the miracles of former ages. As their sin brought them into bondage, so God's pardoning their sin brought them out. All who find pardoning mercy, cannot but wonder at that mercy; we have reason to stand amazed, if we know what it is. When the Lord takes away the guilt of sin, that it may not condemn us, he will break the power of sin, that it may not have dominion over us. If left to ourselves, our sins will be too hard for us; but God's grace shall be sufficient to subdue them, so that they shall not rule us, and then they shall not ruin us. When God forgives sin, he takes care that it never shall be remembered any more against the sinner. He casts their sins into the sea; not near the shore-side, where they may appear again, but into the depth of the sea, never to rise again. All their sins shall be cast there, for when God forgives sin, he forgives all. He will perfect that which concerns us, and with this good work will do all for us which our case requires, and which he has promised. These engagements relate to Christ, and the success of the gospel to the end of time, the future restoration of Israel, and the final prevailing of true religion in all lands. The Lord will perform his truth and mercy, not one jot or tittle of it shall fall to the ground: faithful is He that has promised, who also will do it. Let us remember that the Lord has given the security of his covenant, for strong consolation to all who flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them in Christ Jesus.</body></html>
