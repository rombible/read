Some interpret this prophecy to mean the removal of the law of separation between Jews and Gentiles; others explain it as predicting that the decree of God concerned not the Jews only, but distant nations who should press into the kingdom of God. And this explanation coincides with the effect of the decree, which was to bring to Jerusalem people from "the ends of the world."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The prophet here addresses Zion, and announces her restoration. <span class="cmt_word">In the day that thy walls are to be built;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a day for building thy walls</span> (<span class="accented">gader</span>) <span class="accented">cometh</span>. Zion is represented as a vineyard whose fence has been destroyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5, 7</a>). The announcement is given abruptly and concisely in three short sentences. In that day shall the decree be far removed. The decree (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>) is explained by Hengstenberg and many commentators, ancient and modern, to he that of the enemy by which they held Israel captive. Keil and others suppose the law to be meant which separated Israel from all other nations, the ancient ordinance which confined God's people and the blessings of the theocracy to narrow limits. This is now to be set aside (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-16</a>), when heathen nations flock to the city of God. Oaspari, Hitzig, Cheyne, and others translate, "shall the bound be afar off," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the boundaries of the land of Israel shall be widely extended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>, which Cheyne explains, "Thine eyes shall behold a widely extended territory"). Wordsworth obtains much the same meaning by taking the verb in the sense of "promulgated," and referring the "decree," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7, 8</a>, to God's purpose of giving to Messiah the utmost parts of the earth for a possession. The building, of the walls does not indicate the narowing of the limits of the theocratic kingdom. Whether <span class="accented">chok</span> be taken to signify "decree" (<span class="accented">lex</span>, Vulgate) or "boundary," the effect of its removal afar is seen by the next verse to be the entrance of foreign nations into the kingdom of God. The LXX. favours the first interpretation, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Alex.] <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;</span>, Alex.] <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "That day shall utterly abolish thy ordinances." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:8-13 Those truly penitent for sin, will see great reason to be patient under affliction. When we complain to the Lord of the badness of the times, we ought to complain against ourselves for the badness of our hearts. We must depend upon God to work deliverance for us in due time. We must not only look to him, but look for him. In our greatest distresses, we shall see no reason to despair of salvation, if by faith we look to the Lord as the God of our salvation. Though enemies triumph and insult, they shall be silenced and put to shame. Though Zion's walls may long be in ruins, there will come a day when they shall be repaired. Israel shall come from all the remote parts, not turning back for discouragements. Though our enemies may seem to prevail against us, and to rejoice over us, we should not despond. Though cast down, we are not destroyed; we may join hope in God's mercy, with submission to his correction. No hinderances can prevent the favours the Lord intends for his church.</body></html>
