The type of the greatest enemy of God. <span class="cmt_word">The fortified cities;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the cities of Mazor</span>, the strong land, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Egypt. The usual term for Egypt is Mizraim; but Mazor is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm">2 Kings 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-25.htm">Isaiah 37:25</a>. Cheyne compares the Assyrian name for this country, <span class="accented">Mucar.</span> <span class="cmt_word">From the fortress;</span> <span class="accented">from Mazor</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "from Tyre" or Tsor. <span class="cmt_word">Even to the river.</span> From Egypt to the Euphrates, which was the river <span class="accented">par excellence</span>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From sea to sea</span>. Not necessarily from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea or to the Persian Gulf (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>), but generally, from one sea to another, from the earth as bounded by the seas; so, <span class="cmt_word">from mountain to mountain;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not from Lebanon to Sinai, or from Hor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22</a>) to Hor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-7.htm">Numbers 34:7</a>), which is too limited, but from all lands situated between mountain barriers, which are the bounds of the world (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:8-13 Those truly penitent for sin, will see great reason to be patient under affliction. When we complain to the Lord of the badness of the times, we ought to complain against ourselves for the badness of our hearts. We must depend upon God to work deliverance for us in due time. We must not only look to him, but look for him. In our greatest distresses, we shall see no reason to despair of salvation, if by faith we look to the Lord as the God of our salvation. Though enemies triumph and insult, they shall be silenced and put to shame. Though Zion's walls may long be in ruins, there will come a day when they shall be repaired. Israel shall come from all the remote parts, not turning back for discouragements. Though our enemies may seem to prevail against us, and to rejoice over us, we should not despond. Though cast down, we are not destroyed; we may join hope in God's mercy, with submission to his correction. No hinderances can prevent the favours the Lord intends for his church.</body></html>
