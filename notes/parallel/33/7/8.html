The cities of Babylon and Edom are probably intended. They are mentioned together in Psalms 137 : "Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom." . . . "O Babylon, that art to be destroyed." The fall of those cities should be final, but Jerusalem would rise again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Israel in her sorrow and captivity asserts her undiminished confidence in the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">O mine enemy.</span> The oppressor of the Church, the worldly power, is represented at one time by Asshur, at another by Babylon.

When we complain to the Lord of the badness of the times, we ought to complain against ourselves for the badness of our hearts. We must depend upon God to work deliverance for us in due time. We must not only look to him, but look for him. In our greatest distresses, we shall see no reason to despair of salvation, if by faith we look to the Lord as the God of our salvation. Though enemies triumph and insult, they shall be silenced and put to shame. Though Zion's walls may long be in ruins, there will come a day when they shall be repaired. Israel shall come from all the remote parts, not turning back for discouragements. Though our enemies may seem to prevail against us, and to rejoice over us, we should not despond. Though cast down, we are not destroyed; we may join hope in God's mercy, with submission to his correction. No hinderances can prevent the favours the Lord intends for his church.</body></html>
