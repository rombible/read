"Ah! what a saying!" or, "Is this a thing to be said, O house of Jacob?" The versions of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3b2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., and of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dicit domus Jacob</span>, do not suit the Hebrew. If we adopt the rendering of the Authorized Version, we must consider that Micah addresses those who gloried in their privilege as the family of Jacob, though they had ceased to be what he was, believing and obedient. "O ye who are only in name and title the chosen nation" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33, 39</a>). Professor Driver (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1887) obtains the very suitable meaning, <span class="accented">Num dicendum</span>, "Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the ear of the Lord shortened?" etc., by the change of a vowel point. Somewhat similarly Orelli, "Is this the speech of the house of Jacob?" viz. - Should Jehovah be impatient (as these threats declare him to be)? or were these his doings? The following clause is Jehovah's answer to the objection. <span class="cmt_word">Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?</span> or, <span class="accented">shortened</span>. Is he less long suffering than Jehovah of heretofore? Will you accuse Jehovah of impatience? "Shortness" of spirit is opposed to longanimity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are these his doings?</span> Are these judgments and chastisements his usual doings that which he delights in? Is the cause of them in him? Is it not in you (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">Do not my words do good,</span> etc.? This may be Jehovah's answer to the previous questions, or Micah's refutation of the complaint. The Lord's word is good, his action is a blessing, but only to him who does his commandments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-50.htm">Luke 1:50</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-11 Since they say, Prophesy not, God will take them at their word, and their sin shall be their punishment. Let the physician no longer attend the patient that will not be healed. Those are enemies, not only to God, but to their country, who silence good ministers, and stop the means of grace. What bonds will hold those who have no reverence for God's word? Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted. You shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There is corruption in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distance from it. It is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but not for our portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuing city; let us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing city above. Since they will be deceived, let them be deceived. Teachers who recommend self-indulgence by their doctrine and example, best suit such sinners.</body></html>
