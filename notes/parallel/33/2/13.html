The passage is clearly Messianic, and can neither be considered an interpolation nor tortured into a declaration of the siege and ruin of Samaria or Jerusalem. "One that breaketh" is a liberator, a leader that overcomes all obstacles which oppose Israel's return. There may be an allusion in the first instance to a human leader, such as Zerubbabel, in analogy with Moses and Joshua in old time, but the real conqueror intended is generally regarded as Messiah. The Breaker up is supposed to be a title of the Messiah well known to the Jews (see Pusey; and Pearson, 'Exposition of the Creed,' art. 7, note y). This interpretation is rejected by Professor Driver (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April 1887), who considers the "breaker up" to be "either a leader or a detachment of men, whose duty it was to break up walls or other obstacles opposing the progress of an army." But is not this to introduce an agency unknown to these times? Was there any special body of men trained and maintained for this particular duty? This "breaker up," according to Dr. Driver's conception, "advances before them, breaking through the gates of the prison in which the people are confined; they follow, marching forth triumphantly through this open way; their king, with Jehovah at his side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>), heads the victorious procession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">They have broken up;</span> <span class="accented">broken forth</span>, or <span class="accented">through.</span> The captives cooperate with their leader. <span class="cmt_word">Have passed through the gate,</span> etc. The prophet speaks of a solemn, regular removal, like the Exodus from Egypt, which no human power can oppose. <span class="cmt_word">Their king.</span> The same as Jehovah in the next clause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>). He shall lead the host, as he headed the Israelites when they left the house of bondage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The prediction may look forward to the final gathering of Israel, which St. Paul seems to contemplate when he writes, "And so all Israel shall be saved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12,13 These verses may refer to the captivity of Israel and Judah. But the passage is also a prophecy of the conversion of the Jews to Christ. The Lord would not only bring them from captivity, and multiply them, but the Lord Jesus would open their way to God, by taking upon him the nature of man, and by the work of his Spirit in their hearts, breaking the fetters of Satan. Thus he has gone before, and the people follow, breaking, in his strength, through the enemies that would stop their way to heaven.</body></html>
