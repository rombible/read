probably here "a taunting song." The enemy shall use the words in which Israel laments her calamity as a taunt against her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And lament with a doleful lamentation.</span> The Hebrew gives a remarkable alliteration, <span class="accented">Nahah nehi niheyah</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "Lament a lamentation with melody;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Cantabitur canticum cum suavitate</span>; "Wail a wail of woe." (Pusey). The Syriac coincides with the LXX. By taking the three words as cognates, we get a very forcible sentence; but most modern commentators consider <span class="accented">niheyah</span> not a feminine formation, butniph. of the substantive verb <span class="accented">hayah</span>; hence the words would mean, "Lament with the lamentation;" "It is done," they shall say; "we are utterly spoiled." Thus Cheyne. The lamentation begins with "It is done," and continues to the end of the verse. The verbs are used impersonally - "one shall take up," "one shall lament," "one shall say;" but it is plain that the last two refer to the Jews who shall utter the given dirge, which in turn shall be repeated as a taunt by the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">We are utterly spoiled.</span> According to the second of the explanations of the preceding clause, these words expand and define the despairing cry, "It is done!" In the other case, they are the commencement of the lamentation. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "We are miserably miserable." The complaint is twofold. First, the once flourishing condition of Israel is changed to ruin and desolation. Secondly, <span class="cmt_word">He hath changed</span> (<span class="accented">changeth</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the portion of my people.</span> This is the second calamity: he, Jehovah, passes our inheritance over to the hands of others; the land of Canaan, pledged to us, is transferred to our enemies. Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>, "hath been measured with a line." <span class="cmt_word">How hath he removed it</span> [the portion] <span class="cmt_word">from me!</span> This is better than the alternative rendering, "How doth he depart from me?" Turning away he hath divided our fields; rather, <span class="accented">to an apostate he</span> <span class="accented">divideth our fields.</span> The apostate is the King of Assyria or Chaldea; and he is so named as being a rebel against Jehovah, whom he might have known by the light of natural religion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-15.htm">Micah 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). This was fulfilled later by the colonization of Samaria by a mixed population. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Woe to the people that devise evil during the night, and rise early to carry it into execution! It is bad to do mischief on a sudden thought, much worse to do it with design and forethought. It is of great moment to improve and employ hours of retirement and solitude in a proper manner. If covetousness reigns in the heart, compassion is banished; and when the heart is thus engaged, violence and fraud commonly occupy the hands. The most haughty and secure in prosperity, are commonly most ready to despair in adversity. Woe to those from whom God turns away! Those are the sorest calamities which cut us off from the congregation of the Lord, or cut us short in the enjoyment of its privileges.</body></html>
