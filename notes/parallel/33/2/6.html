The oppressors desire the prophets to cease prophesying; nevertheless, the prophecies shall be continued, but without benefit to those who will not put away their shame.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-11.</span> - &sect; 7. <span class="accented">The threat announced in ver.</span> 3 <span class="accented">is further vindicated and applied to individual sinners, with a glance at the false prophets who taught the people to love lies.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy ye not;</span> literally, <span class="accented">drop ye not</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a> (where see note). The speakers are generally supposed to be the false prophets who wish to stop the mouths of Micah and those who are like minded with him. This is probably correct; but these are not the only speakers; the people themselves, the oppressing grandees, who side with the popularity hunting seers, are also included (see note on ver. 12). Say they to them that <span class="cmt_word">prophesy</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thus they prophesy</span> (<span class="accented">drop</span>). Micah uses their own word sarcastically, "Do not be always rebuking; Thus they rebuke." The rest of the verse belongs to the same speakers, and should be rendered, "They shall not prophesy of these things; reproaches never cease." The great men and the false prophets complain of the true prophets that they are always proclaiming misfortune and rebuking the people, and they bid them leave such denunciations alone for the future. The passage is very difficult, and its interpretation has greatly exercised commentators; the above is virtually the explanation of Ewald, Hitzig, Caspari, and Cheyne. Orelli makes the two last clauses Micah's answer to the interdict of the adversaries, "Should one not prophesy of these things? Should reproaches (against the true prophets) never cease?" We prefer the interpretations given above, and consider the prophet's reply to be given in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-11 Since they say, Prophesy not, God will take them at their word, and their sin shall be their punishment. Let the physician no longer attend the patient that will not be healed. Those are enemies, not only to God, but to their country, who silence good ministers, and stop the means of grace. What bonds will hold those who have no reverence for God's word? Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted. You shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There is corruption in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distance from it. It is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but not for our portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuing city; let us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing city above. Since they will be deceived, let them be deceived. Teachers who recommend self-indulgence by their doctrine and example, best suit such sinners.</body></html>
