They are not old offences which the Lord is visiting, but sins of recent and daily occurrence. <span class="cmt_word">My people is risen up as an enemy.</span> A reading, varying by a letter or two, is rendered, "But against my people one setteth himself."

This translation obviates the difficulty of referring the words, "my people," in this verse to the oppressor, and in ver. 7 to the oppressed. According to the usual view, and retaining the authorized rendering, the meaning is that the princes exhibit themselves as enemies of the Lord by their acts of violence and oppression, which the prophet proceeds to particularize. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, "My people withstood as an enemy." <span class="cmt_word">Ye pull off the robe with the garment;</span> <span class="accented">ye violently strip off the robe away from the garment.</span> The "robe" (<span class="accented">eder</span>) is the wide cloak, the mantle sufficient to wrap the whole person, and which was often of very costly material. The "garment" (<span class="accented">salmah</span>) is the principal inner garment, or tunic. There may be an allusion to the enactment which forbade a creditor retaining the pledged garment during the night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>, etc.).

The grandees rob those who are peaceably disposed, perhaps strip their debtors of their cloaks as they pass quietly along the road. The versions vary considerably from the received Hebrew text.

(with which the Syriac partially agrees) has, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "To remove hope in the destruction of war;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Eos qui transibant simpliciter convertistis in bellum.</span> From this rendering Trochon derives the paraphrase - Ye treat them as if they were prisoners of war. Hitzig considers that the reference is to fugitives from the northern kingdom who passed through Judaea in their endeavour to escape the evils of the war, leaving wives and children in the hands of the Judaeans. But these treated the refugees harshly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-11 Since they say, Prophesy not, God will take them at their word, and their sin shall be their punishment. Let the physician no longer attend the patient that will not be healed. Those are enemies, not only to God, but to their country, who silence good ministers, and stop the means of grace. What bonds will hold those who have no reverence for God's word? Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted. You shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There is corruption in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distance from it. It is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but not for our portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuing city; let us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing city above. Since they will be deceived, let them be deceived. Teachers who recommend self-indulgence by their doctrine and example, best suit such sinners.</body></html>
