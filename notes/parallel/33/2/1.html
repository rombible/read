There is a gradation in the terms employed: they mark the deliberate character of the acts: there were no extenuating circumstances. In the night they <span class= "ital">formed</span> the plan, they <span class= "ital">thought it out</span> upon their beds, and <span class= "ital">carried it out</span> into execution in the morning. So also the gradually increasing intercourse with the wicked is described, as reaching its culmination, in the first Psalm: <span class= "ital">Walking</span> with the ungodly leads to <span class= "ital">standing</span> among sinners, and at last <span class= "ital">sitting</span> habitually in the seat of the scornful.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> ? &sect; 6. <span class="accented">The prophet justifies his threat by recounting the sins of which the grandees and guilty.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The prophet, himself one of the people, first inveighs against the sins of injustice and oppression of the poor. <span class="cmt_word">Devise... work... practise.</span> A gradation. They are not led into these sins by others; they themselves conceive the evil purpose in their own heart; then they prepare and mature their scheme by reflection; then they proceed to execute it. Work evil; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prepare the means for carrying out their conception (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Upon their beds.</span> At night, the natural time for reflection (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm">Psalm 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is light.</span> Far from shrinking from the light of day in putting into effect their evil projects, they set about their accomplishment as soon as ever the morning allows them. <span class="cmt_word">Because it is in the power of their hand.</span> Their might makes their right. (For the phrase, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>.) As the word <span class="accented">el</span> may be taken to mean "God" as well as "power," some render here, "For their hand is their god," comparing the boast of Mezentius in Virgil, 'AEneid,' 10:773 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Dextra mihi Deus et telum quod missile libro."</span> The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Quoniam contra Deum est manus eorum</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Because they lifted not up their hands unto God." So the Syriac, with the omission of the negative. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Woe to the people that devise evil during the night, and rise early to carry it into execution! It is bad to do mischief on a sudden thought, much worse to do it with design and forethought. It is of great moment to improve and employ hours of retirement and solitude in a proper manner. If covetousness reigns in the heart, compassion is banished; and when the heart is thus engaged, violence and fraud commonly occupy the hands. The most haughty and secure in prosperity, are commonly most ready to despair in adversity. Woe to those from whom God turns away! Those are the sorest calamities which cut us off from the congregation of the Lord, or cut us short in the enjoyment of its privileges.</body></html>
