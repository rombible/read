We have the same figurative expression for merciless extortion and pillage. Ezekiel makes a similar complaint (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>). Cheyne sees in this and the following verse a possible allusion to cannibalism as at least known to the Israelites by hearsay or tradition. There is a passage in Wisdom (12:5) which somewhat countenances the idea that the Canaanites were guilty of this enormity, but it is probably only a rhetorical exaggeration of the writer. In the present passage the terms seem to be simply metaphors taken from the preparation of meat for human food. Such an allusion is natural in the mouth of one who had just been speaking of Israel as a flock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 Men cannot expect to do ill, and fare well; but to find that done to them which they did to others. How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.</body></html>
