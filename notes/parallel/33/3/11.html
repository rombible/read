They rely for safety upon the presence of the sacred buildings; they cry, "The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are these!" "Is not the Lord among us?" Isaiah contrasts in scathing terms the profession of holiness with the vicious life as seen in Jerusalem, and likens the city, with its rulers, to Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/1-10.htm" title="Declare you it not at Gath, weep you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.">Micah 1:10-15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judge for reward.</span> The very judges take bribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>), which the Law so stringently forbade (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The priests thereof teach for hire.</span> The priests were bound to teach and explain the Law, and decide questions of religion and ritual (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-11.htm">Haggai 2:11</a>, etc.). This they ought to have done gratuitously, but they corruptly made it a source of gain. <span class="cmt_word">Divine for money.</span> The accusation in ver. 5 is repeated. These false prophets sold their oracles, pretending to have a suitable revelation when paid for it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-28.htm">Ezekiel 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet will they lean upon the Lord.</span> These priests and prophets were worshippers of Jehovah and trusted in him, as though he could not fosake his people. They had faith without love, divorced religion from morality, made a certain outward conformity serve for righteousness and truth. <span class="cmt_word">Is not the Lord among us?</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>). As though the very fact that they had in their midst the temple, wherein Jehovah's presence was assured, would protect them from all harm, whatever their conduct might he. Such presumptuous confidence is reproved by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7:4, 8, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-14.htm">Amos 5:14</a>, and note there). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-12 Zion's walls owe no thanks to those that build them up with blood and iniquity. The sin of man works not the righteousness of God. Even when men do that which in itself is good, but do it for filthy lucre, it becomes abomination both to God and man. Faith rests in the Lord as the soul's foundation: presumption only leans upon the Lord as a prop, and would use him to serve a turn. If men's having the Lord among them will not keep them from doing evil, it never can secure them from suffering evil for so doing. See the doom of wicked Jacob; Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field. This was exactly fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and is so at this day. If sacred places are polluted by sin, they will be wasted and ruined by the judgments of God.</body></html>
