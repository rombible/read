More than a century later the elders of the land, speaking in justification of the course taken by Jeremiah, used as a precedent the example of Micah. They spake to all the assembly of the people, saying, "Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.' Did Hezekiah, king of Judah, and all Judah put him at all to death? Did he not fear the Lord, and besought the Lord, and the Lord repented Him of the evil which He had pronounced against them?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/26-17.htm" title="Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,">Jeremiah 26:17-19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Shall become heaps.</span>--So also, in after-days, the doom of Jerusalem was pronounced by our Lord: "The days will come when there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - This is the prophecy quoted by the elders to King Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-17.htm">Jeremiah 26:17</a>, etc.). It may have been delivered before Hezekiah's time originally, and repeated in his reign, when it was productive of a reformation. The denunciation is a mourn-fill contrast to the announcement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>; but it was never completely fulfilled, being, like all such judgments, conditioned by circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore... for your sake.</span> For the crimes of rulers, priests, and prophets. <span class="cmt_word">Shall Zion... be ploughed as a field.</span> Three localities are specified which destruction shall overtake Zion, Jerusalem, and the temple. Zion means that part of the city where stood the royal palace. The prophecy relates primarily to the destruction of the city by the Chaldeans, when, as Jeremiah testifies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-18.htm">Lamentations 5:18</a>), Zion was desolate and foxes walked upon it. The expression in the text may be hyperbolical, but we know that the ploughing up of the foundations of captured cities is often alluded to. Thus Horace, 'Carm.,' 1:16, 20 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"... imprimeretque muris<br />Hostile aratrum exercitus insolens."</span> (Comp. 'Propert.,' 3:7, 41; and for the whole passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13, 14</a>.) "The general surface of Mount Zion descends steeply eastwards into the Tyropoeon and Kidron, and southwards into the Valley of Hinnom. The whole of the hill here is under cultivation, and presents a most literal fulfilment of Micah's prophecy" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 540). "From the spot on which I stood," says Dr. Porter, "I saw the plough at work in the little fields that now cover the site of Zion" ('Illustrations of Bible Prophecy,' p. 17). <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem shall become heaps.</span> The city proper shall become heaps of ruins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>) Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "as a storehouse for <span class="accented">fruits</span>," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>.

In the time of the Maccabees, after its profanation by the heathen, the account speaks of shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest or in one of the mountains (1 Macc. 4:38).

The sin of man works not the righteousness of God. Even when men do that which in itself is good, but do it for filthy lucre, it becomes abomination both to God and man. Faith rests in the Lord as the soul's foundation: presumption only leans upon the Lord as a prop, and would use him to serve a turn. If men's having the Lord among them will not keep them from doing evil, it never can secure them from suffering evil for so doing. See the doom of wicked Jacob; Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field. This was exactly fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and is so at this day. If sacred places are polluted by sin, they will be wasted and ruined by the judgments of God.</body></html>
