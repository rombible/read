Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "out of vision;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">pro visione.</span> Hence some interpret this as spoken to the false prophets, who, to punish their lying prophecies and pretended revelations, shall be overwhelmed with calamity. But it is best taken as still addressed to the rulers, and Micah tells how that in the time of their distress there shall be no prophecy to direct them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>).

"Night" and "darkness" are metaphors for calamity, as in all languages. <span class="cmt_word">That ye shall not divine;</span> <span class="accented">without divination.</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "out of prophecy." Parallel and identical in meaning with the preceding clause. <span class="cmt_word">The sun shall go down over the prophets;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> over the false prophets. The sun of their prosperity shall set. Micah seems to derive his imagery from the phenomena of an eclipse (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The day.</span> The time of their punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 Men cannot expect to do ill, and fare well; but to find that done to them which they did to others. How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.</body></html>
