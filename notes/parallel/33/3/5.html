The Hebrew word, <span class= "ital">nashak,</span> which is rendered "bite," is strictly applied to serpents, to "an adder in the path," and is therefore especially appropriate to the false and lying nature of the prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-8.</span> ? &sect; 2. <span class="accented">Sins of the false prophets who led the people astray.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concerning the prophets</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>). These are the lying prophets of whom Jeremiah complains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace.</span> Very many commentators take the phrase, "bite with the teeth," to mean "eat," so that the clause signifies that the prophets when bribed with food predict peace and happiness to people. The antithesis of the following clause seems to require this explanation, which is further supported by the Chaldee. But it is quite unprecedented to find the word translated "bite" (<span class="accented">nashakh</span>) in the sense of "eat," or as it is taken here, "to have something to eat;" wherever it occurs it means "to bite like a serpent," to wound (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>). The parallelism of the succeeding member does not compel us to put a forced interpretation upon the word. These venal seers do vital harm, inflict gravest injury, when they proclaim peace where there is no peace; by such false comfort they are really infusing poison and death. <span class="cmt_word">He that putteth not into their mouths.</span> If any one does not bribe them, and so stop their evil mouths. <span class="cmt_word">They even prepare war against him.</span> The Hebrew expression is, "they consecrate" or "sanctify war." There may be allusion to the religious rites accompanying a declaration of war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>); but Micah seems to mean that, if the customary bribes are withheld, these prophets announce war and calamity as inevitable; they proclaim them in God's name, as speaking with his sanction and under his Inspiration (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; see note on Zephaniah 1:7). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 Men cannot expect to do ill, and fare well; but to find that done to them which they did to others. How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.</body></html>
