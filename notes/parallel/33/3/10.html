They raise palaces with money gained by extortion, rapine, and judicial murders like that of Naboth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-27.htm">Ezekiel 22:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>). Cheyne thinks this to be a too dark view of the state of public morals, and would therefore consider "blood" to be used for violent conduct leading to ruin of others, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>. In these passages, however, actual bloodshed may be meant; and we know too little of the moral condition of Judaea at this time to be able to decide against the darker view. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-12 Zion's walls owe no thanks to those that build them up with blood and iniquity. The sin of man works not the righteousness of God. Even when men do that which in itself is good, but do it for filthy lucre, it becomes abomination both to God and man. Faith rests in the Lord as the soul's foundation: presumption only leans upon the Lord as a prop, and would use him to serve a turn. If men's having the Lord among them will not keep them from doing evil, it never can secure them from suffering evil for so doing. See the doom of wicked Jacob; Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field. This was exactly fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and is so at this day. If sacred places are polluted by sin, they will be wasted and ruined by the judgments of God.</body></html>
