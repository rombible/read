The first of these is "power," - such might imparted to him that his words fall with force and proclaim their Divine origin (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).

In these points he is in strong contrast to the false prophets, who were not inspired by the Spirit of God. spoke not with power, called good evil, and evil good, were timid and time-serving. <span class="cmt_word">Jacob... Israel.</span> The two are identical as in ver. 1, and the clauses in which they occur contain the same thought repeated for emphasis' sake. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 Men cannot expect to do ill, and fare well; but to find that done to them which they did to others. How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.</body></html>
