But the meaning of the Hebrew is very uncertain, and the text may be corrupt. The LXX. had a different reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "darkness shall be in thee." The Syriac and Chaldee interpret the word rendered "casting down" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;</span>, which is found nowhere else) of some disease like dysentery. It is most suitable to understand this clause as connected with the preceding threat of hunger, and to take the unusual word in the sense of "emptiness." Thus, "Thy emptiness (of stomach) shall remain in thee." Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>)speaks of the famine in the city at the time of its siege. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take hold;</span> rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt remove</span> (<span class="accented">thy goods</span>). This is the second chastisement. They should try to take their goods and families out of the reach of the enemy, but should not be able to save them. The LXX. interprets the verb of escaping by flight. <span class="cmt_word">That which thou deliverest.</span> If by chance anything is carried away, it shall fall into the hands of the enemy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7, 8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-16 God, having showed how necessary it was that they should do justly, here shows how plain it was that they had done unjustly.
