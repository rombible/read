The reading is uncertain. Others render, "Blessed is he who sees thy Name;" but the construction is against this. Others, "Thy Name looketh to wisdom" (or prosperity), has the true wisdom of life in sight. The versions read "fear" for "see." Thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x39f;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "Shall save those that fear his Name;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Salus erit timentibus Nomen tuum</span>; Syriac, "He imparts instruction to those that fear his Name;" Chaldee, "The teachers fear his Name." This reading depends upon a change of vowel pointing. Orelli renders, "Happy is he who fears thy Name." The Authorized translation, which seems on the whole to be well established, takes the abstract noun "wisdom" as equivalent to "the wise," or "the man of wisdom." For similar expressions, Henderson refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>-4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-6.htm">Proverbs 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>.

This voice of the Lord says to all, Hear the rod when it is coming, before you see it, and feel it. Hear the rod when it is come, and you are sensible of the smart; hear what counsels, what cautions it speaks. The voice of God is to be heard in the rod of God. Those who are dishonest in their dealings shall never be reckoned pure, whatever shows of devotion they may make. What is got by fraud and oppression, cannot be kept or enjoyed with satisfaction. What we hold closest we commonly lose soonest. Sin is a root of bitterness, soon planted, but not soon plucked up again. Their being the people of God in name and profession, while they kept themselves in his love, was an honour to them; but now, being backsliders, their having been once the people of God turns to their reproach.</body></html>
