The Vulgate has a different reading, <span class="accented">In multis millibus hircorum pinguium</span>; so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Alex.] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "with ten thousands of fat goats," so also the Syriac. The alteration has been introduced probably with some idea of making the parallelism more exact. <span class="cmt_word">Shall I give my firstborn?</span> Micah exactly represents the people's feeling; they would do anything but what God required; they would make the costliest sacrifice, even, m their exaggerated devotion, holding themselves ready to make a forbidden offering; but they would not attend to the moral requirements of the Law. It is probably by a mere hyperbole that the question in the text is asked. The practice of human sacrifice was founded on the notion that man ought to offer to God his dearest and costliest, and that the acceptability of an offering was proportioned to its preciousness. The Hebrews had learned the custom from their neighbours, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Phoenicians and Moabites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>), and had for centuries offered their children to Moloch, in defiance of the stern prohibitions of Moses and their prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>). They might have learned, from many facts and inferences, that man's self-surrender was not to be realized by this ritual; the sanctity of human life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>), the substitution of the ram for Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>), the redemption of the firstborn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>), all made for this truth. But the heathen idea retained its hold among them, so that the inquiry above is in strict keeping with the circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">The fruit of my body;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rest of my children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-8 These verses seem to contain the substance of Balak's consultation with Balaam how to obtain the favour of Israel's God. Deep conviction of guilt and wrath will put men upon careful inquiries after peace and pardon, and then there begins to be some ground for hope of them. In order to God's being pleased with us, our care must be for an interest in the atonement of Christ, and that the sin by which we displease him may be taken away. What will be a satisfaction to God's justice? In whose name must we come, as we have nothing to plead as our own? In what righteousness shall we appear before him? The proposals betray ignorance, though they show zeal. They offer that which is very rich and costly. Those who are fully convinced of sin, and of their misery and danger by reason of it, would give all the world, if they had it, for peace and pardon. Yet they do not offer aright. The sacrifices had value from their reference to Christ; it was impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin. And all proposals of peace, except those according to the gospel, are absurd. They could not answer the demands of Divine justice, nor satisfy the wrong done to the honour of God by sin, nor would they serve at all in place of holiness of the heart and reformation of the life. Men will part with any thing rather than their sins; but they part with nothing so as to be accepted of God, unless they do part with their sins. Moral duties are commanded because they are good for man. In keeping God's commandments there is a great reward, as well as after keeping them. God has not only made it known, but made it plain. The good which God requires of us is, not the paying a price for the pardon of sin and acceptance with God, but love to himself; and what is there unreasonable, or hard, in this? Every thought within us must be brought down, to be brought into obedience to God, if we would walk comfortably with him. We must do this as penitent sinners, in dependence on the Redeemer and his atonement. Blessed be the Lord that he is ever ready to give his grace to the humble, waiting penitent.</body></html>
