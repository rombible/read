Balaam was constrained to bless when he had the highest conceivable motive to curse the Israelites. He apologised for this involuntary action on his part to Balak. There is no more conclusive instance extant of the will of man controlled to do the exact opposite of his intended action in the history of mankind. It is better to put a stop after "answered him." The next sentence records an independent instance of the interposition of God in behalf of Israel. "Remember also the incidents which happened from Shittim to Gilgal." Shittim was the name of a valley in the plains of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>), from which place Joshua sent two spies to view Jericho immediately before the passage of the Jordan to Gilgal was effected, under the circumstances mentioned in the fourth chapter of Joshua.<p><span class= "bld">Righteousness.</span>--The word rather means here <span class= "ital">liberality, beneficence.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The Lord reminds the people of another great benefit subsequent to the Exodus, viz. the defeat of the designs of Balak, and the sorceries of Balaam. <span class="cmt_word">Consulted</span>.

The answer of Balaam was the blessing which he was constrained to give, instead of the curse which he was hired to pronounce (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-10.htm">Joshua 24:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From Shittim unto Gilgal.</span> This is a fresh consideration, referring to mercies under Joshua, and may be made plainer by inserting "remember" (which has, perhaps, dropped out of the text), as in the Revised Version. Shittim was the Israelites' last station before crossing the Jordan, and Gilgal the first in the land of Canaan; and so God bids them remember all that happened to them between those places - their sin in Shittim and the mercy then shown them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>.), the miraculous passage of the Jordan, the renewal of the covenant at Gilgal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>). <span class="accented">Shittim</span>; <span class="accented">the acacia meadow</span> (<span class="accented">Abel-Shittim</span>)<span class="accented">, hod.
