Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>,"Hath it not been told thee?" <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>What doth the Lord require of thee?</span> The prophets often enforce the truth that the principles of righteous conduct are required from men, and not mere formal worship. This might well be a comfort to the Israelites when they heard that they were doomed to be cast out of their country, and that the temple was to be destroyed, and that the ritual on which they laid such stress would for a time become impracticable. So the inculcation of moral virtues is often connected with the prediction of woe or captivity. (For the prophetic view of the paramount importance of righteousness, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, etc.: 1. 8, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, etc.; see on Zechariah 7:7.) <span class="cmt_word">To do justly.</span> To act equitably, to hurt nobody by word or deed, which was the exact contrary of the conduct previously mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1, 2, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To love mercy.</span> To be guided in conduct to others by loving kindness. These two rules contain the whole duty to the neighbour. Compare Christ's description of genuine religion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To walk humbly with thy God.</span> This precept comprises man's duty to God, humility and obedience. "To walk" is an expression implying "to live and act" as the patriarchs are said to have "walked with God," denoting that they lived as consciously under his eye and referred all their actions to him. Humility is greatly enforced in the Scriptures (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, etc.). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "to be ready to walk with the Lord;" Vulgate, S<span class="accented">olicitum ambulare</span> <span class="accented">cum Deo</span>; Syriac, "Be prepared to follow thy God." But our version is doubtless correct. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-8 These verses seem to contain the substance of Balak's consultation with Balaam how to obtain the favour of Israel's God. Deep conviction of guilt and wrath will put men upon careful inquiries after peace and pardon, and then there begins to be some ground for hope of them. In order to God's being pleased with us, our care must be for an interest in the atonement of Christ, and that the sin by which we displease him may be taken away. What will be a satisfaction to God's justice? In whose name must we come, as we have nothing to plead as our own? In what righteousness shall we appear before him? The proposals betray ignorance, though they show zeal. They offer that which is very rich and costly. Those who are fully convinced of sin, and of their misery and danger by reason of it, would give all the world, if they had it, for peace and pardon. Yet they do not offer aright. The sacrifices had value from their reference to Christ; it was impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin. And all proposals of peace, except those according to the gospel, are absurd. They could not answer the demands of Divine justice, nor satisfy the wrong done to the honour of God by sin, nor would they serve at all in place of holiness of the heart and reformation of the life. Men will part with any thing rather than their sins; but they part with nothing so as to be accepted of God, unless they do part with their sins. Moral duties are commanded because they are good for man. In keeping God's commandments there is a great reward, as well as after keeping them. God has not only made it known, but made it plain. The good which God requires of us is, not the paying a price for the pardon of sin and acceptance with God, but love to himself; and what is there unreasonable, or hard, in this? Every thought within us must be brought down, to be brought into obedience to God, if we would walk comfortably with him. We must do this as penitent sinners, in dependence on the Redeemer and his atonement. Blessed be the Lord that he is ever ready to give his grace to the humble, waiting penitent.</body></html>
