The Lord shall be the Arbiter to whom all disputes shall be referred, as in the next clause. When his reign is acknowledged and his Law obeyed, all war and all causes of war shall cease. The gospel is a gospel of peace and love, and when "the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>), peace and love shall everywhere abound. (For the phrase in the text, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-27.htm">Judges 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-12.htm">1 Samuel 24:12, 15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke strong nations afar off.</span> The word rendered '"rebuke" means here "decide concerning," "act as umpire for."

But very precious promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which will be more and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. There shall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight in doing his will. The word halteth, describes those who walk not according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives from Babylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend the ordinances of God, that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them, receiving the law from his hands, which, being written in our hearts by his Spirit, may show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.</body></html>
