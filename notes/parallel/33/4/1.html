As the third chapter commenced with a startling denunciation, following immediately upon the predicted blessings of the restored kingdom, so upon that chapter, closed in deepest gloom, there now rises a vision of glorious light. The first three verses are almost identical with the second chapter of Isaiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-2.htm" title="And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Micah 4:2-4</a>; and it has been almost an open question which of the two prophets is the original author of them, or whether indeed they both adopted the words from an older prophecy current at the time. Dr. Pusey takes very decided ground, saying, "It is now owned, well-nigh on all hands, that the great prophecy, three verses of which Isaiah prefixed to his second chapter, was originally delivered by Micah. . . . No one now thinks Micah adopted that great prophecy from Isaiah" (<span class= "ital">Minor Prophets,</span> p. 289). This last statement, however, is far too sweeping; all that can be correctly said is that the preponderance of opinion is in favour of Micah being regarded as the original writer.<p><span class= "bld">In the top of the mountains</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the mountain of the Lord's house shall be spiritually elevated above all else, visible and invisible, and it shall be established for ever.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-5.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">The prophet suddenly announces the future glory of the temple mountain and the ideal happiness of the people</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. There is no adversative particle here; the verse is merely connected with what precedes without any expressed contrast. What is implied is that it was impossible that the temple, to which God's high promises attached, should lie waste forever. The passage, vers. 1-3, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>, The question as to which prophecy is the earlier cannot be settled. Possibly both prophets borrowed the language of some earlier work, as Isaiah is thought to have done on other occasions, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>. and 16. the community of ideas leading them to the same source of testimony. <span class="cmt_word">In the last days;</span> literally, <span class="accented">at the end of the days</span>; Cheyne, "in the days to come." It is the usual phrase to designate the time of Messiah, unto which the prophet's thoughts are directed, and for which all preceding events and periods are a preparation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-20.htm">Jeremiah 23:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "at the last days." The phrase may often suitably be rendered, "in latter days," as spoken not absolutely, but relatively to preceding times. <span class="cmt_word">The mountain of the house of the Lord.</span> Mount Moriah, the ruin of which was foretold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>). But the term here seems to include Jerusalem itself. Shall be established, firmly and permanently (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-45.htm">1 Kings 2:45</a>), no longer subject to ruin and devastation. <span class="cmt_word">In the top of the mountains;</span> better, <span class="accented">on the head of the mountains.</span> The idea is that the temple mountain shall be raised above, and stand forth prominently from the lower hills that surround it and form its basis (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>). The prophet speaks as if he contemplated a physical change, expressing thereby with singular force the notion that the worship of the true God (of which the temple was the symbol) shall be promulgated among all nations of the world; that from the old Jewish centre of religion a new order of things shall arise, not transitory, nor local, but extending to all time and pervading the utmost parts of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">And people</span> (<span class="accented">peoples</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shall flow unto it.</span> The prophet beholds the nations of the world coming up in formal procession to join in the service of the temple. Thus is adumbrated the comprehension of all nations in the Catholic Church. Isaiah says "all nations" in the parallel passage (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-11.htm">Zephaniah 2:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-22.htm">Zechariah 8:22</a>, and notes there). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 The nations have not yet so submitted to the Prince of Peace, as to beat their swords into ploughshares, nor has war ceased. But very precious promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which will be more and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. There shall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight in doing his will. The word halteth, describes those who walk not according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives from Babylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend the ordinances of God, that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them, receiving the law from his hands, which, being written in our hearts by his Spirit, may show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.</body></html>
