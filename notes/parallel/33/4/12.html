Then the Lord declared that the Assyrian king was but His instrument in all he had done; so that when he presumed to arrogate to himself the glory of his victories, the Lord revoked his commission: "I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou carnest." And so it came to pass.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - But the enemies who came to exult over Zion do not know God's design while blindly working it out. God's people are not to be destroyed, but their adversaries. <span class="cmt_word">They know not the thoughts of the Lord.</span> The heathen, who were the instruments of God's wrath against his people, knew nothing of his purpose in thus afflicting them, nor perceived that they themselves were drawn together for punishment. <span class="cmt_word">He shall gather</span> (<span class="accented">hath gathered</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>them as the sheaves into the floor.</span> Their blindness is proved by their not perceiving till too late that God has brought them together before Jerusalem, as sheaves are brought into the threshing floor, in order to be broken up and destroyed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a>). The metaphor is carried on in the next verse. Various are the explanations of the prophet's reference in this prophecy. Many commentators see in it a reference to the destruction of the army of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>); others discern a defeat of the Scythians after the return from captivity; others, again, place it in the times of the Maccabees; and others interpret it of the defeat of the mystical adversaries of God's Church adumbrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12.htm">Zechariah 12</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20</a>. But the prophet has not one definite event in view, but looks forward to the general conflict between the powers of the world and the Church, of which the historical events and material enemies were the types. Certain historical circumstances may exactly suit the prediction, but they do not exhaust it. And indeed we do wrong to seek for minute and definite fulfilment of particular predictions. Such utterances are often conditional and are modified by subsequent circumstances. The prophets are concerned with great moral truths and the righteous government of the world, and are not always to be interpreted with literal exactness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 Many nations would assemble against Zion to rejoice in her calamities. They would not understand that the Lord had collected them as sheaves are gathered to be threshed; and that Zion would be strengthened to beat them to pieces. Nothing has yet taken place in the history of the Jewish church agreeing with this prediction. When God has conquering work for his people to do, he will furnish them with strength and ability for it. Believers should cry aloud under distresses, with the prayer of faith, not with despondency.</body></html>
