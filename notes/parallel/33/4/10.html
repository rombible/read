It was a century after Micah's time before Babylon recovered its ancient dignity. The fact, however, remains that Micah wrote, "Thou shalt go to Babel;" and there is the other fact, that the people of Judah (not Israel) did go. Micah also declared, "THERE shalt thou be delivered:" and in the time of Cyrus the Jews were delivered there. The repetition, "There . . . there," is emphatic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be in pain.</span> The anguish is not to be resisted, but shall end, like birth pains, in deliverance. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;</span>, "Be in pain, and do bravely, and draw near," which is like Aeneas's encouragement to his friends (Virgil, 'AEneid,' 1:207) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Durate, et vosmet rebus servate secundis."</span> <span class="cmt_word">For now shalt thou go forth.</span> The prophet leaves his metaphor, and announces that the people shall "go forth" into captivity. He says "now,"as having the scene before his eyes. They must leave their city, live shelterless in the open country, be carried to a distant land, even to Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">Shall dwell in the field;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while they are making their way to the place of their captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shall go even to Babylon.</span> This is simple prophecy, and could have been known to Micah only by inspiration. In his day Assyria was the enemy whom Israel had to dread (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5, 6</a>), Babylon being at this time in the position of a conquered country, and not becoming again powerful and independent for another century, So Isaiah prophesied of the captivity to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3-8</a>), if modern critics have not shaken our faith in the genuineness of that chapter. Micah does not define the time of the Captivity, or the agents; he notes merely the place whither the Jews were at last to be deported. Even in this case "Babylon" may have its typical import, and be taken to represent the great world power arrayed against the chosen race; and the prophecy may look forward to other fulfilments in succeeding ages. Some commentators think that Babylon is here mentioned as the most distant country known, or as a portion of the Assyrian empire. Others suppose that Sargon transported some Israelitish captives to Babylon to replace the rebellious Babylonians whom he exiled to Palestine ('Records of the Past,' 7:29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>), and that thus Micah was naturally led to represent the Judaeans as following their brethren. Whichever explanation we take, there is no reason to consider that the reference to Babylon is the interpolation of a late editor of the prophetic writings. <span class="cmt_word">There shall thou be delivered.</span> In Babylon deliverance shall arise. This prophecy was first literally fulfilled in the return from captivity under Cyrus; it is further fulfilled, under Christ, in the rescue of the true Israelites from the bondage of sin and the world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 Many nations would assemble against Zion to rejoice in her calamities. They would not understand that the Lord had collected them as sheaves are gathered to be threshed; and that Zion would be strengthened to beat them to pieces. Nothing has yet taken place in the history of the Jewish church agreeing with this prediction. When God has conquering work for his people to do, he will furnish them with strength and ability for it. Believers should cry aloud under distresses, with the prayer of faith, not with despondency.</body></html>
