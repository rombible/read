It is evidently the same place as <span class="cmt_word">the stronghold</span> (<span class="accented">ophel</span>, "the hill") <span class="cmt_word">of the daughter of Zion.</span> The name "Ophel" is affixed to the southern spur of Moriah, opposite to the Mount Zion, from which it was separated by the Tyropoeon Valley. It was fortified by Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>), and on it were the king's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the old palace of David, and "the tower that lieth out," or the upper tower (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26, 27</a>). This is probably the "flock tower" mentioned in the text (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>, where Ophel and the watch tower are named together); and it is so called as having been originally a place of refuge for flocks, or of observation for shepherds. Micah uses the two expressions to represent the power and dominion of Jerusalem. The propriety of the usa of the term "flock tower" is seen when we remember that David was a shepherd before he was king, and that the Israelites are the sheep of the Lord's pasture. The reference to a flock in the prceeding verses may also have influenced the prophet's thought. Owing to a slight variation in the reading, the LXX. renders <span class="accented">Ophel</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "dark;" so Jerome, "nebulosa;" Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These translators would refer the term to the ruinous condition of the tower. The first dominion shall come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former, original empire, such as it was in the days of David and Solomon, and which had been lost in later times. The LXX. adds, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: and hence the Greek expositors explain the passage as referring to the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. The verb "shall come" is better taken with "the first dominion," and this clause in apposition to the former, "the kingdom of" or "the reign over the daughter of Jerusalem." Sovereignty over Jerusalem, or, as others take it, that appertains to Jerusalem, represents rule over the whole country. In Messiah the glory and power are restored to the throne of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 The nations have not yet so submitted to the Prince of Peace, as to beat their swords into ploughshares, nor has war ceased. But very precious promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which will be more and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. There shall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight in doing his will. The word halteth, describes those who walk not according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives from Babylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend the ordinances of God, that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them, receiving the law from his hands, which, being written in our hearts by his Spirit, may show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.</body></html>
