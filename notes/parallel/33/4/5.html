Micah's description of the universal rule of Messiah is primarily applicable to the antecedent prosperity, after the return of the Jews from the captivity. The zeal of the Jews for Jehovah was stirred up after witnessing the example of "the children of this world" in Babylon. The devotion of the Babylonian princes to their god is strikingly evident in the diaries of Nebuchadnezzar and other prophets, as lately brought to light in <span class= "ital">The Records of the Past.</span> That zealous Society for a national return to the strictness of the Law of Moses at first distinguished and honoured by the name of Pharisees took its rise after the return from the captivity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - This verse gives the reason why Israel is thus strong and safe. In the parallel passage in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-5.htm">Isaiah 2:5</a>) it is converted into an injunction to the house of Jacob. <span class="cmt_word">All people will walk;</span> rather, <span class="accented">all nations walk.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Everyone in the name of his god</span>. "To walk" is generally used of moral and religious habits (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-4.htm">2 Chronicles 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-31.htm">Psalm 89:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-6.htm">Ezekiel 5:6</a>, etc.); so here the meaning is that all other nations adhere to their false gods, and frame their life and conduct relying on the power and protection of these inanities, and, by implication, shall find their hope deceived. <span class="cmt_word">And we will walk in the name of the Lord our God.</span> This is the secret of Israel's strength. The heathen can never prevail against the true believers who put their whole trust in the Lord, and live in union with him. By saying <span class="accented">we</span>, the prophet identifies himself with the faithful people. <span class="cmt_word">Forever and ever</span>. The Church shall never fail. Heathen powers last for a time; the kingdom of Messiah is everlasting. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 The nations have not yet so submitted to the Prince of Peace, as to beat their swords into ploughshares, nor has war ceased. But very precious promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which will be more and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. There shall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight in doing his will. The word halteth, describes those who walk not according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives from Babylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend the ordinances of God, that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them, receiving the law from his hands, which, being written in our hearts by his Spirit, may show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.</body></html>
