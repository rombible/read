In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> Messiah is called "Counsellor." The Septuagint, treating the word as a collective, renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "thy counsel." <span class="cmt_word">Pangs</span>, etc. The comparison of sorrow of heart to the anguish of labour pains is very common (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; 6:43; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 Many nations would assemble against Zion to rejoice in her calamities. They would not understand that the Lord had collected them as sheaves are gathered to be threshed; and that Zion would be strengthened to beat them to pieces. Nothing has yet taken place in the history of the Jewish church agreeing with this prediction. When God has conquering work for his people to do, he will furnish them with strength and ability for it. Believers should cry aloud under distresses, with the prayer of faith, not with despondency.</body></html>
