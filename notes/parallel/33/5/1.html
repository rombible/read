After Zion's degradation Messiah shall be born, and shall bring the world into subjection.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This verse is joined to the preceding chapter in the Hebrew. Jerusalem is addressed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9, 11</a>, not the invading army. The prophet returns to the view of the misery and humiliation expressed in that passage. <span class="cmt_word">Gather thyself in troops;</span> or, <span class="accented">thou shalt gather thyself, etc.</span> Jerusalem must collect its armies to defend itself from the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">O daughter of troops.</span> Jerusalem is thus named from the number of soldiers collected within her walls, from whence marauding expeditions were wont to set forth. Pusey considers that she is so called from the acts of violence, robbery, and bloodshed which are done within her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>). Keil thinks the prophet represents the people crowding together in fear. It is more natural to refer the expression to the abnormal assemblage of soldiers and fugitives within the walls of a besieged city.

To smite upon the cheek is the grossest insult (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>) When Zion is thus besieged, and its rulers suffer the utmost contumely, its condition must look hopeless, Such a state of things was realized in the treatment of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>.), and in many subsequent sieges of Jerusalem. But the underlying idea is that Israel shall suffer dire distress at the hands of her enemies until Messiah comes, and she herself turns to the Lord. The LXX. translates <span class="accented">shophet</span>, "judge," by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, "tribes," but the other Greek translators give <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Having showed how low the house of David would be brought, a prediction of the Messiah and his kingdom is added to encourage the faith of God's people. His existence from eternity as God, and his office as Mediator, are noticed. Here is foretold that Bethlehem should be his birthplace. Hence it was universally known among the Jews, Mt 2:5. Christ's government shall be very happy for his subjects; they shall be safe and easy. Under the shadow of protection from the Assyrians, is a promise of protection to the gospel church and all believers, from the designs and attempts of the powers of darkness. Christ is our Peace as a Priest, making atonement for sin, and reconciling us to God; and he is our Peace as a King, conquering our enemies: hence our souls may dwell at ease in him. Christ will find instruments to protect and deliver. Those that threaten ruin to the church of God, soon bring ruin on themselves. This may include the past powerful effects of the preached gospel, its future spread, and the ruin of all antichristian powers. This is, perhaps, the most important single prophecy in the Old Testament: it respects the personal character of the Messiah, and the discoveries of himself to the world. It distinguishes his human birth from his existing from eternity; it foretells the rejection of the Israelites and Jews for a season, their final restoration, and the universal peace to prevail through the whole earth in the latter days. In the mean time let us trust our Shepherd's care and power. If he permits the assault of our enemies, he will supply helpers and assistance for us.</body></html>
