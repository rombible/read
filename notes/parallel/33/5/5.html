This sentence is connected with the former instead of the following passage, with which the Authorised Version joins it.<p><span class= "bld">When the Assyrian shall come into our land.</span>--This may refer to the imminent apprehension of the invasion of Sennacherib, but the actual event does not correspond to it. It may look forward to the time when the enemies of Israel attacked the Jews in the Maccabean period, and the shepherds, seven or eight--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, an indefinite number--successfully resisted the attacks upon the flock. The intention of the passage may be spiritually interpreted as pointing to the eight principal, strictly anointed men, who, as Christian pastors, receive their commission from the Messiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - &sect; 9. <span class="accented">Under Messiah's rule shall be peace.</span> Cheyne considers these verses to have been inserted by an afterthought, either to explain the "many nations" and "many peoples" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11, 13</a>, or to rectify the omission of the period of foreign rule. This may be reasonably allowed; but it is not necessary to the explanation of the paragraph, which is merely a further description of Messiah's kingdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this Man shall be the Peace;</span> <span class="accented">and he shall be Peace</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">et erit iste Pax</span>. This same Ruler will not only bring peace, and be the Author of peace, but be himself Peace; as Isaiah (Isaiah 9:5) calls him "Prince of Peace," and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>) "our Peace." Peace personified (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>). It is best to put a full stop here, and remove the colon at "land" in the next clause. There may be an allusion to Solomon, the peaceful king, who erected the temple and whose reign exhibited the ideal of happy times. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "and to her shall be peace." <span class="cmt_word">When the Assyrian shall come.</span> The prophet, in this and the following verses, shows what is that peace which Messiah shall bring. Asshur is named as the type of Israel's deadliest foe, and as that which even then was threatening the kingdom: witness Sennaeherib's invasion in Hezekiah's time, when the angel of the Lord smote the alien army with sudden destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>.). The prophecy looks forward to a far distant future, when the world power is strayed against God's people; the details (as often in such prophecies) do not exactly suit the actual facts in contemporary history. <span class="cmt_word">Then shall we raise against him seven shepherds.</span> We, the Israel of God, shall be enabled to repel the enemy. "Shepherds," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> princes, and those in abundance. "Seven" is the perfect number, representing completeness and rest. <span class="cmt_word">And eight principal men;</span> or, <span class="accented">princes among men</span>, appointed by the Ruler as his subordinates and representatives. These are said to be "eight," to imply their great number: there should be a superabundance of able leaders. (On a similar use of numbers, see note on Amos 1:3.) The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "eight attacks of men," reading differently. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Having showed how low the house of David would be brought, a prediction of the Messiah and his kingdom is added to encourage the faith of God's people. His existence from eternity as God, and his office as Mediator, are noticed. Here is foretold that Bethlehem should be his birthplace. Hence it was universally known among the Jews, Mt 2:5. Christ's government shall be very happy for his subjects; they shall be safe and easy. Under the shadow of protection from the Assyrians, is a promise of protection to the gospel church and all believers, from the designs and attempts of the powers of darkness. Christ is our Peace as a Priest, making atonement for sin, and reconciling us to God; and he is our Peace as a King, conquering our enemies: hence our souls may dwell at ease in him. Christ will find instruments to protect and deliver. Those that threaten ruin to the church of God, soon bring ruin on themselves. This may include the past powerful effects of the preached gospel, its future spread, and the ruin of all antichristian powers. This is, perhaps, the most important single prophecy in the Old Testament: it respects the personal character of the Messiah, and the discoveries of himself to the world. It distinguishes his human birth from his existing from eternity; it foretells the rejection of the Israelites and Jews for a season, their final restoration, and the universal peace to prevail through the whole earth in the latter days. In the mean time let us trust our Shepherd's care and power. If he permits the assault of our enemies, he will supply helpers and assistance for us.</body></html>
