Christ, whose graciousness is likened to the dew, and His gentleness to the lamb, is at the same time the Lion of the tribe of Judah. At the opening of the "sixth seal" the kings of the earth and great men are represented as in extreme terror at "the wrath of the Lamb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Secondly, Israel shall be a terrible power among the nations, and invincible in strength. ("Nova theocratica agit suaviter et fortiter" (Knabenbauer). As a lion. The Lamb of God is also the Lion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>), and he "is set for the fall and rising again of many" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>). In his irresistible strength Israel shall overcome all enemies. So Judas Maccabaeus is compared to a lion (1 Macc. 3:4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-15 The remnant of Israel, converted to Christ in the primitive times, were among many nations as the drops of dew, and were made instruments in calling a large increase of spiritual worshippers. But to those who neglected or opposed this salvation, they would, as lions, cause terror, their doctrine condemning them. The Lord also declares that he would cause not only the reformation of the Jews, but the purification of the Christian church. In like manner shall we be assured of victory in our personal conflicts, as we simply depend upon the Lord our salvation, worship him, and serve him with diligence.</body></html>
