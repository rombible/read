So, through the dispersion of Jewish Christians, on the death of St. Stephen, the Lord caused the knowledge of the truth with which the Jews were cloud-charged to descend upon many people: "He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass; as showers that water the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm" title="He shall come down like rain on the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.">Psalm 72:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - &sect; 10. <span class="accented">The people</span> <span class="accented">under Messiah's rule have a mission to execute</span>; <span class="accented">they are to be not only conquerors, but saviours also.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - First, Israel in God's hands shall be an instrument of life and health to the nations. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Jacob.</span> The faithful, Messianic Israel, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Many people;</span> rather; <span class="accented">many peoples</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11, 13</a>); so in ver. 8. The LXX. inserts <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "among the nations," as in ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">As a dew from the Lord.</span> Converted Israel shall act as Messiah himself in refreshing and stimulating the nations. Receiving grace from him, she shall diffuse it to others. (For the metaphor of dew thus used, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>.) It is especially appropriate in a country where from May to October the life of herbage depends chiefly on the copious dews (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-10.htm">Haggai 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As the showers upon the grass.</span> The dew is called "showers" as appearing to descend in a multitude of drops. <span class="cmt_word">That tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</span> This refers to the dew, which is wholly the gift of God, and is not artificially supplied by man's labour, as Egypt is "watered by the foot" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10</a>). So grace is God's free, unmerited gift, and will come upon the nation! in his good time and way. The LXX. has here a curious rendering, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which Jerome explains of the obdurate Gentiles who continue in unbelief, "as lambs upon the grass, that none may assemble nor withstand among the sons of men." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-15 The remnant of Israel, converted to Christ in the primitive times, were among many nations as the drops of dew, and were made instruments in calling a large increase of spiritual worshippers. But to those who neglected or opposed this salvation, they would, as lions, cause terror, their doctrine condemning them. The Lord also declares that he would cause not only the reformation of the Jews, but the purification of the Christian church. In like manner shall we be assured of victory in our personal conflicts, as we simply depend upon the Lord our salvation, worship him, and serve him with diligence.</body></html>
