It may mean "to break" or "to feed;" and in the latter sense may signify either "to eat up" or "to be shepherd over," as the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, The addition, <span class="cmt_word">with the sword,</span> however, limits the explanation, whichever verb we refer it to. These leaders shall not only defend their own land against the enemy, but shall carry the war into the hostile territory, conquer it, and rule with rigour (for the phrase, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>). True religion has always a war to wage with error and worldliness, but shall conquer in the power of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Nimrod.</span> This is taken by some commentators to mean Babylon, the other great enemy of the Church of God. But Babylon is nowhere in Scripture called "the land of Nimrod," though Nimrod is connected with Babel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>; and the term is better explained here as a synonym of Assyria, used to recall the "rebel" (so <span class="accented">Nimrod</span> is interpreted) who founded the first empire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-8.htm">Genesis 10:8-12</a>), and gives the character to the kingdom of this world. <span class="cmt_word">In the entrances thereof;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the gates thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the cities and fortresses, corresponding to the "palaces" of ver. 5 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>).

Israel has to undergo much tribulation and many struggles, but Messiah shall save her. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Having showed how low the house of David would be brought, a prediction of the Messiah and his kingdom is added to encourage the faith of God's people. His existence from eternity as God, and his office as Mediator, are noticed. Here is foretold that Bethlehem should be his birthplace. Hence it was universally known among the Jews, Mt 2:5. Christ's government shall be very happy for his subjects; they shall be safe and easy. Under the shadow of protection from the Assyrians, is a promise of protection to the gospel church and all believers, from the designs and attempts of the powers of darkness. Christ is our Peace as a Priest, making atonement for sin, and reconciling us to God; and he is our Peace as a King, conquering our enemies: hence our souls may dwell at ease in him. Christ will find instruments to protect and deliver. Those that threaten ruin to the church of God, soon bring ruin on themselves. This may include the past powerful effects of the preached gospel, its future spread, and the ruin of all antichristian powers. This is, perhaps, the most important single prophecy in the Old Testament: it respects the personal character of the Messiah, and the discoveries of himself to the world. It distinguishes his human birth from his existing from eternity; it foretells the rejection of the Israelites and Jews for a season, their final restoration, and the universal peace to prevail through the whole earth in the latter days. In the mean time let us trust our Shepherd's care and power. If he permits the assault of our enemies, he will supply helpers and assistance for us.</body></html>
