In this passage the parallelism seems to require the name of a town where the English Version has "at all." But the Hebrew word thus represented may, by the addition of a letter which has dropped out of the text, be rendered "in Accho," or Ptolemais, now called Acca. The LXX. translation <span class= "greekheb">?? ?? ???</span>, <span class= "greekheb">?? ??????????? ?? ?? ????</span>, <span class= "greekheb">??</span> (=<span class= "greekheb">?? ?<span class= "ital">?</span> ??<span class= "ital">?</span>? ??</span>), accords with this reading. The parallelism is thus maintained, and the thought is completed: "Mention not the trouble in our enemies' cities; bewail it in our own."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-15.</span> - 4. <span class="accented">The judgment on Judah is exemplified by the fate of certain of its cities, whose names the prophet connects with their punishment in a series of paronomasias.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Declare ye it not at Gath.</span> This phrase from David's elegy over Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>) had become a proverbial saying, deprecating the malicious joy of their hostile neighbours over the misfortunes that befell them. Gath is mentioned as the seat of the Philistines, the constant and powerful enemy of Judah. (For its situation, see note on Amos 6:2.) The paronomasias in this passage, which seem to modern ears artificial and puerile, are paralleled in many writings both Hebrew and classic, and were natural to a people who looked for mystical meaning in words and names. Thus Gath is taken to signify "Tell town," and the clause is, "In Tell town tell it not." <span class="cmt_word">Weep ye not at all;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">lacrymis ne ploretis</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "weep in silence," or "hide your tears," that the enemy may not know your grief. As in cash of the other clauses a town is mentioned, some editors would here read, "In Acco ('Weep town') weep not!" - Acco being the later Ptolemais, the modern St. Jean d'Acre, and taken here to represent another foreign city which would rejoice at Judah's misfortunes (see, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>). The Septuagint alone of all the versions seems to countenance this reading, by translating, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "Ye Enakim, do not rebuild," which has been resolved into <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;</span>, supposed to be an error for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;</span> The objections against this reading may be seen in Keil and Pusey. There is a play on the words in both these clauses (as in the following five verses), which is not seen in the English Version, <span class="accented">begath al taggidu</span>, and <span class="accented">bako al tibeku.</span> Knabenbauer imitates the paronomasia in Latin, "Cannis ne canite; Anconae ne angamini;" Ewald and Schegg in German, "In Molln meldet nicht; in Weinsberg. weinet nicht;" Reuss in French, "N'allez pas le dire a Dijon! N'allez pas pleurer a Ploermel!" In these puns, as we should call them, the prophet is far, indeed, from jesting. "He sees," says Dr. Cheyne, "like Isaiah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>, a preordained correspondence between names and fortunes;" and he wishes to impress this on his countrymen, that the judgment may not come upon them unwarned. <span class="cmt_word">In the house of Aphrah</span>; better, at <span class="accented">Beth-le-Aphrah, i.e.</span> "House of dust;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">in domo pulveris.</span> The site of Aphrah is unknown. Some identify it with Ophrah in Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>), four miles northeast of Bethel; others, with Ophrah in Philistia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-14.htm">1 Chronicles 4:14</a>). Host of the towns named below lie in the Shephelah. Keil notes that the word is pointed with <span class="accented">pathach</span> here for the sake of the paronomasia. <span class="cmt_word">Roll thyself in the dust;</span> <span class="accented">sprinkle dust upon thyself</span>. This was a common sign of mourning (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>). The Hebrew text (in contradistinction to the margin, Keri) gives, "I roll myself," or "I have besprinkled myself," the prophet identifying himself with the people. But as in all the subsequent passages, not what the prophet does, but what the inhabitants do, is the point impressed, the reading of the Keri is hem to be preferred. Vulgate, <span class="accented">pulvere vos conspergite.</span> The Septuagint has an inexplicable rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "against laughter sprinkle earth," which Brenton translates, "sprinkle dust in the place of your laughter." With this section (vers. 10-15) should be compared <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>, which describes the alarm occasioned by Sennacherib's invasion of Judah from the northeast, as Micah represents his progress to the southwest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it not in Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.</body></html>
