Samaria, on her hill, set an example of idolatry, drunkenness, and all the evils of a most profligate society; and even Jerusalem, the city "set on an hill," gave a home in the Temple of Jehovah to heathen deities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">Judgment is denounced on Israel for its sin.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The prophet shows the cause of this punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Transgression</span>; better, <span class="accented">apostasy</span>, which the people's trangression really was. <span class="cmt_word">Jacob</span>.

He names the capitals of the two kingdoms as the source and centre of the idolatry and wickedness which pervaded the whole country. Samaria was built by Omri, a king who "wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all that were before him;" and in it his son Ahab erected a temple to Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32</a>), and it became the chief seat of idolatry in the land. <span class="cmt_word">What are the high places?</span> The prophet seems to say that Jerusalem is no longer the Lord's sanctuary, but a collection of unauthorized or idolatrous shrines. These were buildings or altars erected in conspicuous spots, contrary to the enactments of the Mosaic Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11-14</a>), and used more or less for idolatrous worship. With a strange perversity, the Jews mixed the pure service of Jehovah with the rites of heathen deities. Even the best kings of Judah were unable wholly to suppress these local sanctuaries (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>, etc.). They were found even in Jerusalem itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>), especially in the time of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-4.htm">2 Kings 16:4</a>). The parallelism of this clause with the preceding being thought defective ("high places" being not parallel with "apostasy"), the Septuagint reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "the sin," followed by the Syriac and the Targum. One Hebrew manuscript confirms the reading; but it is probably unauthorized, and has been ignorantly introduced The prophet defines the sins of Samaria and Jerusalem. The sin of the former is apostasy; that of the latter, unauthorized worship. Instead of "what" in both places the Hebrew gives "who," implying that there is a personal cause, the two capitals being personified. Hezekiah's partial reformation had not taken place when this was uttered. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The earth is called upon, with all that are therein, to hear the prophet. God's holy temple will not protect false professors. Neither men of high degree, as the mountains, nor men of low degree, as the valleys, can secure themselves or the land from the judgments of God. If sin be found in God's people he will not spare them; and their sins are most provoking to him, for they are most reproaching. When we feel the smart of sin, it behoves us to seek what is the sin we smart for. Persons and places most exalted, are most exposed to spiritual diseases. The vices of leaders and rulers shall be surely and sorely punished. The punishment answers the sin. What they gave to idols, never shall prosper, nor do them any good. What is got by one lust, is wasted on another.</body></html>
