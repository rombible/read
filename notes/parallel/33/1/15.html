It was fortified by Rehoboam, and became the scene of Asa's victory over the immense host of Zerah the Ethiopian. Dr. Robinson is of opinion that after its destruction the town of Eleutheropolis was built out of its materials.<p><span class= "bld">Adullam the glory of Israel.</span>--Adullam, in the neighbourhood of Mareshah, was situated at the base of the hills, and gave its name to the famous cave in which David took refuge. Joshua mentions a king of Adullam in the list of those conquered by the Israelites. This, now the last refuge of the glory of Israel, shall be seized by the invader.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah.</span> "Mareshah" sounds like <span class="accented">Morashah</span>, the Hebrew word for "inheritance;" so the play is, "I will bring an inheritor who shall claim your Heritage town." The "heir" is the Assyrian king, Sargon, into whose possession the city shall pass. Mareshah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>) was near Achzib, one mile southcast of Beit Jibrin, and is now called <span class="accented">Mer'ash</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall come,</span> etc.; better, <span class="accented">the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nobility (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>) of Israel shall fly for refuge to such places as the cave of Adullam, David's asylum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>). So the Vulgate. The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f48;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span> "The inheritance shall come to Odullam, even the glory of the daughter of Israel." But Rosenmuller, Henderson, Pusey, and others take the sentence as in the Authorized Version, making "the glory of Israel" in apposition with "Adullam," and understanding by "he" the heir or enemy. One knows no reason why Aduliam should be honoured with the above-named title; so the rendering given above is preferable. There is probably a paronomasia intended, "The glory of the Lord shall set (<span class="accented">ad olam</span>) forever." The city of Adullam, <span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Aid-el-Mah</span>, lay in the valley of Elah, ten miles northwest of Hebron, halfway between Sochoh and Keilah. It was of great antiquity, being mentioned as the birthplace of Hirah, the friend of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12</a>), and one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>). In its neighbourhood is the celebrated cave, Mugha et Khureitun, which is pointed out as the traditional hold of David, and which has been carefully explored by Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake, of the Palestine Exploration Fund (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' pp. 332, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it not in Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.</body></html>
