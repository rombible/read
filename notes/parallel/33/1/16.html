The shaving of the head as a token of grief was common amongst Eastern nations, and is distinct from the idolatrous custom of cutting the hair in a peculiar shape denounced by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm" title="Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.">Jeremiah 9:26</a>, margin), and forbidden by the Jewish Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27-28</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As the eagle.</span>--The Hebrew name for eagle includes the different kinds of vultures. Entire baldness is a marked feature of the vulture.<p>The terms in which Joel speaks of the entire desolation of the cities of Judah must refer to a more complete calamity than that inflicted by Sennacherib; they rather suit the period of the Babylonian captivity.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">The prophet calls upon Zion to mourn for her captivity. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Make thee bald.</span> The Hebrew word implies "to make the back of the head bald." Micah addressee Zion as the mother of the children who are to be led into captivity. Shaving the head in sign of mourning seems to have been retained as a traditionary custom in spite of the prohibition of the Law against certain forms which the practice assumed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; and for the actual custom, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>; and the note on Amos 8:10). <span class="cmt_word">Poll thee.</span> Cut off thy hair, nearly synonymous with the word in the former clause. <span class="cmt_word">Thy delicate children;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the children of thy delights</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the children who are a joy and comfort to thee, the citizens of thy kingdom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-9.htm">Micah 2:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As the eagle</span> (<span class="accented">nesher</span>). The vulture is meant, either <span class="accented">Vultur percnopterus</span>, common in Egypt and Palestine, which is bald on the front of the head and neck, or more probably <span class="accented">Vultur fulvus</span>, the griffon vulture, whose whole head and neck are destitute of true feathers (see 'Bible Educator,' 2:247). <span class="cmt_word">Into captivity.</span> This cannot refer exclusively to the Assyrian invasion, wherein very few captives were taken, but must look forward to the Babylonian deportation in ch. 4:10. The latter calamity alone is parallel to the destruction of Samaria announced in vers. 6, 7 of this chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it not in Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.</body></html>
