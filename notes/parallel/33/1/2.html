All nations are summoned to come and witness the judgment, and to profit by the warning. So Micaiah, son of Imlah, the bold denouncer of false prophets in the age of Ahah, had cried, "Hear, ye peoples, all of you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>). So Moses, in his song (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>), calls on heaven and earth to listen to his words (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>). These expressions are not mere rhetorical figures; they have a special application. Whatever happens to Israel has a bearing on the development of the kingdom of God; the judgments on the chosen people are not only a warning to the heathen, but bring on the great consummation. <span class="cmt_word">All that therein is;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the fulness thereof</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">plentitudo ejus</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>, "all ye that are therein" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let the Lord God</span> (<span class="accented">the Lord Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>be witness against you</span>. Let God by his judgments against you, viz.

God's holy temple will not protect false professors. Neither men of high degree, as the mountains, nor men of low degree, as the valleys, can secure themselves or the land from the judgments of God. If sin be found in God's people he will not spare them; and their sins are most provoking to him, for they are most reproaching. When we feel the smart of sin, it behoves us to seek what is the sin we smart for. Persons and places most exalted, are most exposed to spiritual diseases. The vices of leaders and rulers shall be surely and sorely punished. The punishment answers the sin. What they gave to idols, never shall prosper, nor do them any good. What is got by one lust, is wasted on another.</body></html>
