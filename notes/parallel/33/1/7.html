and these "hires" are the offerings made to the shrines of the idols to which the Israelites forsaking Jehovah had transferred their worship. All these treasures shall be destroyed; the Assyrians shall carry them off for the adornment of their temples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Graven images.</span> The stone idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>).

Idolatry is viewed as spiritual fornication, and the offerings made to the idol temples are reckoned to be harlot gifts. Hosea speaks in the same way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5, 8, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-1.htm">Hosea 9:1</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-31.htm">Ezekiel 16:31</a>). There may be allusion to the shameful practices consecrated with the name of religion, the proceeds of which went to the support of idolatry (see Baruch 6:43; Herod., 1:199; Strabo, 16:1). <span class="cmt_word">Idols</span>; more costly images, made probably of or plated with precious metals. <span class="cmt_word">For she gathered it;</span> rather, them, the images and idols, from the offerings made by idolaters, spiritual fornicators, hence called <span class="cmt_word">the hire of an harlot. They shall return to the hire of an harlot.</span> The treasures obtained by idolatry shall go to another idolatrous people, viz. the Assyrians; the dedicated offerings in the temples at Samaria shall be carried off to Nineveh to adorn the temples there (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-3.htm">Daniel 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7</a>). The sentence seems to be a kind of proverbial saying, like the Latin, <span class="accented">Male parta, male dilabuntur.</span> Sehegg compares the German, <span class="accented">Wie gewonnen, so zerronnen</span>, and <span class="accented">Unrect Gut that sein Gut</span>. The judgment on Samaria was executed by the Assyrians. Three times in his short reign of less than six years did Shalmaneser IV. invade Israel. Shortly after his accession, having reason to suspect the fidelity of Hoshea, he "came up against him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>), and so overawed him by the exhibition of his superior power that the King of Israel submitted without a struggle, "became his servants and gave him presents," or rendered him tribute. But Hoshea's allegiance was not yet secured. Encouraged by the enterprise and success of the Ethiopian monarch So, or Shebek, who had defeated and slain the Egyptian king, and established himself firmly on the throne of Upper Egypt, Hoshea, in reliance on Egyptian aid, again threw off the yoke of Assyria, and refused the customary tribute. His punishment was speedy and sharp. Shalmaneser had no difficulty in making himself master of his person, "shut him up and bound him in prison." On a fresh act of rebellion, of what nature we are not informed, Shalmaneser made his third attack. This time he was everywhere resisted, and ended by laying siege to Samaria itself. Before this city his forces were detained for more than two years; nor was it till <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, when apparently his own reign had come to an end, that Samaria was taken, his successor Sargon claiming the conquest as appertaining to his first year (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2. ch. 9.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The earth is called upon, with all that are therein, to hear the prophet. God's holy temple will not protect false professors. Neither men of high degree, as the mountains, nor men of low degree, as the valleys, can secure themselves or the land from the judgments of God. If sin be found in God's people he will not spare them; and their sins are most provoking to him, for they are most reproaching. When we feel the smart of sin, it behoves us to seek what is the sin we smart for. Persons and places most exalted, are most exposed to spiritual diseases. The vices of leaders and rulers shall be surely and sorely punished. The punishment answers the sin. What they gave to idols, never shall prosper, nor do them any good. What is got by one lust, is wasted on another.</body></html>
