The word rendered "wail" means "to beat" the breast. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">plangam.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Stripped and naked</span>.

The two epithets contain one notion; the prophet assumes the character, not merely of a mourner, who put off his usual garments, but that of a captive who was stripped to the skin and carried away naked and despoiled (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Dragons</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: Hebrew, <span class="accented">tannim</span>, "jackals" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>), whose mournful howling is well known to all travellers in the East. <span class="cmt_word">Owls</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "daughters of sirens;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">struthionum.</span> The bird is called in Hebrew bath <span class="accented">yaanah</span>, which some explain "daughter of the desert," or else refer to roots meaning either "to cry out" or "to be freed." Doubtless the ostrich is meant. Concerning the fearful screech of this bird, Pusey quotes Shaw, 'Travels,' 2:349, "During the lonesome part of the night they often make a doleful and piteous noise. I have often heard them groan as if they were in the greatest agonies." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it not in Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.</body></html>
