A very strong and important city of the Canaanites, <span class="accented">hod. Um Lakis</span>, about fourteen miles northeast of Gaza, which was captured by Sennacherib after a long siege (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>). In the British Museum there is a bas-relief, brought from Assyria, representing Sennacherib seated on his throne while the spoil of the city of Lachish passed before him (Sayce, 'Fresh Light from the Monuments,' pp. 123, 125). <span class="cmt_word">Bind the chariot to the swift beast.</span> Harness your horses to your chariots, that ye may flee and escape destruction. The phrase is like the Latin, <span class="accented">currum</span> <span class="accented">jungere equis.</span> The paronomasia here lies in the sound, "Inhabitant of Lachish, harness your <span class="accented">rekkesh"</span> ("runner," "courser"). "Inhabitant of Horse town, harness your horses." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "a sound of chariots and horsemen;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">tumultus quadrigae stuporis</span> - renderings which the present Hebrew text does not support. She was the beginning, etc. How Lachish came to adopt the idolatry of Israel, and how she infected Judah, we know not. A connection between Jerusalem and Lachish is found in the case of Amaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>), but nothing bearing on religion is mentioned. The whole clause is translated by Calmer, Keil, etc., thus: "It was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion that the iniquities of Israel were found in thee" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). The particular transgressions meant may be the idolatry of Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-6.htm">2 Chronicles 21:6</a>) and Ahaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3, 4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it not in Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.</body></html>
