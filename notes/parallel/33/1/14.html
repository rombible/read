Because Judah has adopted the evil practices of Israel. The prophet here addresses Judah, and continues to do so to the end of the chapter. <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou give presents to Moreshsth-Gath.</span> The "presents" intended are parting gifts, farewell presents. The word is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>) for the dowry given to a daughter when she is married. The meaning, therefore, is that Judah must relinquish all claim to Moresheth. The paronomasia is explained in two ways. As <span class="accented">Moresheth</span> may mean "possession," the prophet may be understood to say, "Thou shalt give up possession of Gath's possession." Or the play of words may depend upon the similarity of sound between <span class="accented">Moresheth</span> and <span class="accented">Meorasah</span>, "Betrothed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>), "Thou shalt give dismissal (bill of divorcement) to the city once betrothed to thee." Moresheth-Gath, Micah's birthplace, is placed just south of Beit Jibrin, or Eleutheropolis, about twenty-five miles from Gaza (see Introduction, &sect; II.). The addition of Gath to the name of the town is meant to mark its situation in the immediate neighbourhood of that well known city. So we have Bethlehem-Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>), Abel-Maim or Maachah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>).

The city shall be yielded to the enemy and lost to the Judaeans. Achzib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>), <span class="accented">hod. Ain Kezbeh</span>, eight miles north of Adullam, is probably the same as Chezib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a>), where Shelah, Judah's son by Tamar, was born. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of Israel.</span> "Israel" is here equivalent to Judah, having, according to the prediction of vers. 6, 7, lost its political existence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19</a>, where Ahaz is called King of Israel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it not in Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.</body></html>
