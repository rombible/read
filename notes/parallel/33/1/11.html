St. Jerome, in despair of explaining these Greek renderings, says here, "Multum Hebraicum a LXX. interpretatione discordat, et tantis tam mea quam illorum translatio difficultatibus involuta est, ut si quando indiguimus Spiritus Dei (semper autem in exponendis Scripturis sanctis illius indigemus adventu), nunc vel maxime eum adesse cupiamus." <span class="cmt_word">Zaanan</span> is supposed to be the same as Zenan, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-37.htm">Joshua 15:37</a>. The meaning of the name is doubtful. It is taken to signify "abounding in flocks" or "going out." <span class="cmt_word">Came not forth;</span> or, <span class="accented">is not come forth.</span> The paronomasia seems to lie rather in sound than sense, and is variously explained, "The inhabitants of Flock town went not forth with their flocks." "The dwellers of Forthcoming came not forth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to flee, or to fight, or to aid their brethren; or did not escape destruction.

Beth-ezel is explained, "House at one's side." "Neighbour town;" so the prophet would say, "Neighbour town is no neighbour to you," affords you no help. But various other explanations are given. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "Lamentation makes its sure abode at Beth-ezel from your calamity." This may, perhaps, be supported by the rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "She shall receive of you the stroke of anguish." Dr. Cheyne connects the whole verse with one idea, "Zaanan would willingly take to flight, but the sound of the mourning at Beth-ezel (which might mean, "the house, or place, at one's side') fills them with despair." Taking Beth-ezel to mean "House of root," others would interpret, on account of the public sorrow, "The 'house of root' affords no firm home for you." Others, again," The lamentation of 'The near House' will not stop near it, but pass on to other places." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-ezel</span> is probably the <span class="accented">Azal</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>, the <span class="accented">beth</span> being dropped, as is often the case. It was in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem (see note on Zechariah. <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it not in Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.</body></html>
