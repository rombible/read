Timidity has become boldness; for the few hasty words recorded in the Gospels we have elaborate discourses. There is a method and insight in the way he deals with the prophecies of the Christ altogether unlike anything that we have seen in him before. If we were reading a fictitious history, we should rightly criticise the author for the want of consistency in his portraiture of the same character in the first and second volumes of his work. As it is, the inconsistency becomes almost an evidence of the truth of the narratives that contain it. The writer of a made-up-history, bent only upon reconciling the followers of Peter and of Paul, would have made the former more prominent in the Gospels or less prominent in the Acts. And the facts which St. Luke narrates are an adequate explanation of the phenomena. In the interval that had passed, Peter's mind had been opened by his Lord's teaching to understand the Scriptures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-45.htm" title="Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,">Luke 24:45</a>), and then he had been endued, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, with power from on high. That which he now speaks is the first utterance of the new gift of prophecy, and followed rightly on I the portent of the "tongues" to bring about the work of conversion which they had no power to accomplish. The speech which follows was spoken either in the Aramaic of Palestine, or, more probably, in the Greek, which was common in Galilee, and which would be intelligible to all, or nearly all, of the pilgrims from distant countries.<p><span class= "bld">And said unto them.</span>--The verb is not the word commonly so rendered, but that which is translated "utterance," or "to utter," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>. The unusual word was probably repeated here to indicate that what follows was just as much an "utterance" of the Holy Spirit, working on and through the spiritual powers of man, as <span class= "ital">the</span> marvel of the "tongues" had been.<p><span class= "bld">Hearken to my words.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">give ear to.</span> The verb is an unusual one, and is found here only in the New Testament. It is used not unfrequently in the LXX., as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm" title="And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.">Genesis 4:22</a>; Job 23:18.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-16.</span> <span class="accented">- Spake forth</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">give ear unto</span> for <span class="accented">hearken to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">hath been spoken</span> for <span class="accented">was spoken</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">But Peter</span>, etc. Peter stands up before the eleven as their primate, foremost in the authority of action as in precedence of place; and the apostles stand up before the multitude of believers, as those to whom Christ committed the government of his Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>). Spake forth (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, the same word as in ver. 4, "utterance "); implying the utterance of a loud and grave oration. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26.htm">1 Chronicles 26</a>. it is the phrase of the LXX. for those who <span class="accented">prophesied</span> with harps. From it is derived the word <span class="accented">apophthegm</span>, "a remarkable saying" (Johnson's Dictionary). <span class="cmt_word">Ye that dwell at Jerusalem</span>; the same as those described in ver. 5. They were foreign Jews who, either for the feast or for other causes, had taken up their abode at Jerusalem, and are distinguished from the men <span class="accented">of Judea</span>, the Jews who were natives of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">Give ear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>); found only here in the New Testament, but frequent in the LXX. as the rendering of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-1.htm">Job 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>). It is not classical Greek, and seems to have been coined by the LXX., as the equivalent of the above-named Hebrew word. It seems to be a rhetorical phrase. The thing to <span class="accented">be known</span> unto them was that they saw the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy in what had happened; for it was quite a mistake to attribute it to drunkenness. <span class="cmt_word">By the</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophet</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>); spoken by God through the prophet. The full phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5, 15</a>. And so it is added in ver. 17, "saith God." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-21 Peter's sermon shows that he was thoroughly recovered from his fall, and thoroughly restored to the Divine favour; for he who had denied Christ, now boldly confessed him. His account of the miraculous pouring forth of the Spirit, was designed to awaken the hearers to embrace the faith of Christ, and to join themselves to his church. It was the fulfilling the Scripture, and the fruit of Christ's resurrection and ascension, and proof of both. Though Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues as the Spirit gave him utterance, yet he did not think to set aside the Scriptures. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bible; and the Spirit is given, not to do away the Scriptures, but to enable us to understand, approve, and obey them. Assuredly none will escape the condemnation of the great day, except those who call upon the name of the Lord, in and through his Son Jesus Christ, as the Saviour of sinners, and the Judge of all mankind.</body></html>
