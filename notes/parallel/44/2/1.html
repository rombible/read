That choice may have been determined, if one may so speak, either in view of the circumstances of the feast, or of its history and symbolic fitness.<p>(1) Of all the feasts of the Jewish year, it was that which attracted the largest number of pilgrims from distant lands. The dangers of travel by sea or land in the early spring or late autumn (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>) prevented their coming in any large numbers to the Passover or the Feast of Tabernacles. At no other feast would there have been representatives of so many nations. So, it may be noted, it was the Feast of Pentecost that St. Paul went up to keep once and again, during his mission-work in Greece and Asia. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-21.htm" title="But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.">Acts 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-16.htm" title="For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hurried, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.">Acts 20:16</a>.) So far, then, there was no time on which the gift of the Spirit was likely to produce such direct and immediate results.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Was now come</span> for <span class="accented">was fully come</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">all together</span> for <span class="accented">with one accord</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">When the day of Pentecost was now come</span>; literally, <span class="accented">when the day of Pentecost</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the fiftieth day - was in <span class="accented">the course of being completed.</span> The fiftieth day (reckoned from the end of the 16th of Nisan, on which Jesus was crucified) was actually come, but was not ended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-11.htm">Luke 9:11</a>).

In one place (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>, note). The purpose, doubtless, of their coming together was for prayer, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; and the third hour (9 a.m., ver. 15), the hour of offering the morning sacrifice, was close at hand (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-10.htm">Luke 1:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 We cannot forget how often, while their Master was with them there were strifes among the disciples which should be the greatest; but now all these strifes were at an end. They had prayed more together of late. Would we have the Spirit poured out upon us from on high, let us be all of one accord. And notwithstanding differences of sentiments and interests, as there were among those disciples, let us agree to love one another; for where brethren dwell together in unity, there the Lord commands his blessing. A rushing mighty wind came with great force. This was to signify the powerful influences and working of the Spirit of God upon the minds of men, and thereby upon the world. Thus the convictions of the Spirit make way for his comforts; and the rough blasts of that blessed wind, prepare the soul for its soft and gentle gales. There was an appearance of something like flaming fire, lighting on every one of them, according to John Baptist's saying concerning Christ; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. The Spirit, like fire, melts the heart, burns up the dross, and kindles pious and devout affections in the soul; in which, as in the fire on the altar, the spiritual sacrifices are offered up. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than before. They were filled with the graces of the Spirit, and more than ever under his sanctifying influences; more weaned from this world, and better acquainted with the other. They were more filled with the comforts of the Spirit, rejoiced more than ever in the love of Christ and the hope of heaven: in it all their griefs and fears were swallowed up. They were filled with the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they had miraculous powers for the furtherance of the gospel. They spake, not from previous though or meditation, but as the Spirit gave them utterance.</body></html>
