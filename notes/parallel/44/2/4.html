Now they felt, in St. Peter's words, as "borne onward" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>), thinking thoughts and speaking words which were not their own, and which they could hardly even control. They had passed into a state which was one of rapturous ecstasy and joy. We must not think of the gift as confined to the Apostles. The context shows that the writer speaks of all who were assembled, not excepting the women, as sharers in it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17-18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And began to</span> <span class= "bld">speak with other tongues.</span>--Two facts have to be remembered as we enter upon the discussion of a question which is, beyond all doubt, difficult and mysterious. (1) If we receive <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/16-9.htm" title="Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.">Mark 16:9-20</a> as a true record of our Lord's words, the disciples had, a few days or weeks before the Day of Pentecost, heard the promise that they that believed should "speak with new tongues" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-17.htm" title="And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;">Mark 16:17</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>with new powers of utterance. (2) When St. Luke wrote his account of the Day of Pentecost, he must have had--partly through his companionship with St. Paul, partly from personal observation--a wide knowledge of the phenomena described as connected with the "tongues" in 1 Corinthians 14. He uses the term in the sense in which St. Paul had used it. We have to read the narrative of the Acts in the light thrown upon it by the treatment in that chapter of the phenomena described by the self-same words as the Pentecost wonder. What, then, are those phenomena? Does the narrative of this chapter bring before us any in addition? (1) The utterance of the "tongue" is presented to us as entirely unconnected with the work of teaching. It is not a means of instruction. It does not edify any beyond the man who speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-4.htm" title="He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.">1Corinthians 14:4</a>). It is, in this respect, the very antithesis of "prophecy." Men do not, as a rule, understand it, though God does (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1Corinthians 14:2</a>). Here and there, some mind with a special gift of insight may be able to interpret with clear articulate speech what had been mysterious and dark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-13.htm" title="Why let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.">1Corinthians 14:13</a>). St. Paul desires to subject the exercise of the gift to the condition of the presence of such an interpreter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-5.htm" title="I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.">1Corinthians 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-27.htm" title="If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.">1Corinthians 14:27</a>). (2) The free use of the gift makes him who uses it almost as a barbarian or foreigner to those who listen to him. He may utter prayers, or praises, or benedictions, but what he speaks is as the sound of a trumpet blown uncertainly, of flute or lyre played with unskilled hand, almost, we might say, in the words of our own poet, "like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-7.htm" title="And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?">1Corinthians 14:7-9</a>). (3) Those who speak with tongues do well, for the most part, to confine their utterance to the solitude of their own chamber, or to the presence of friends who can share their rapture When they make a more public display of it, it produces results that stand in singular contrast with each other. It is a "sign to them that believe not," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>it startles them, attracts their notice, impresses them with the thought that they stand face to face with a superhuman power. On the other hand, the outside world of listeners, common men, or unbelievers, are likely to look on it as indicating madness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23</a>). If it was not right or expedient to check the utterance of the tongues altogether, St. Paul at least thought it necessary to prescribe rules for its exercise which naturally tended to throw it into the background as compared with prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-27.htm" title="If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.">1Corinthians 14:27-28</a>). The conclusion from the whole chapter is, accordingly, that the "tongues" were not the power of speaking in a language which had not been learnt by the common ways of learning, but the ecstatic utterance of rapturous devotion. As regards the terms which are used to describe the gift, the English reader must be reminded that the word "unknown" is an interpolation which appears for the first time in the version of 1611. Wiclif, Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Rhemish give no adjective, and the Geneva inserts "strange." It may be noted further that the Greek word for "tongue" had come to be used by Greek writers on Rhetoric for bold, poetic, unusual terms, such as belonged to epic poetry (Aristot. R<span class= "ital">het.</span> iii. 3), not for those which belonged to a foreign language. If they were, as Aristotle calls them, "unknown," it was because they were used in a startlingly figurative sense, so that men were sometimes puzzled by them (Aristot. R<span class= "ital">het.</span> iii. 10). We have this sense of the old word (<span class= "ital">glossa</span>) surviving in our <span class= "ital">glossary</span>, a collection of such terms. It is clear (1) that such an use of the word would be natural in writers trained as St. Paul and St. Luke had been in the language of Greek schools; and (2) that it exactly falls in with the conclusion to which the phenomena of the case leads us, apart from the word.<p>We turn to the history that follows in this chapter, and we find almost identical phenomena. (1) The work of teaching is not done by the gift of tongues, but by the speech of Peter, and that was delivered either in the Aramaic of Palestine, or, more probably, in the Greek, which was the common medium of intercourse for all the Eastern subjects of the Roman empire. In that speech we find the exercise of the higher gift of prophecy, with precisely the same results as those described by St. Paul as following on the use of that gift. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-37.htm" title="Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?">Acts 2:37</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1Corinthians 14:24-25</a>.) (2) The utterances of the disciples are described in words which convey the idea of rapturous praise. They speak the "mighty works," or better, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-49.htm" title="For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name.">Luke 1:49</a>, the <span class= "ital">great things</span> of God. Doxologies, benedictions, adoration, in forms that transcended the common level of speech, and rose, like the Magnificat, into the region of poetry: this is what the word suggests to us. In the wild, half dithyrambic hymn of Clement of Alexandria--the earliest extant Christian hymn outside the New Testament--in part, perhaps, in that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24-30</a>, and the Apocalyptic hymns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-13.htm" title="And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.">Revelation 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-10.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.">Revelation 7:10</a>), we have the nearest approach to what then came, in the fiery glow of its first utterance, as with the tongues "of men and of angels," from the lips of the disciples. (3) We cannot fail to be struck with the parallelism between the cry of the scoffers here, "These men are full of new wine" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm" title="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a>), and the words, "Will they not say that ye are mad?" which St. Paul puts into the mouth of those who heard the "tongues" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23</a>). In both cases there is an intensity of stimulated life, which finds relief in the forms of poetry and in the tones of song, and which to those who listened was as the poet's frenzy. It is not without significance that St. Paul elsewhere contrasts the "being drunk with wine" with "being filled with the Spirit," and immediately passes on, as though that were the natural result, to add "speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18-19</a>). If we find the old Jewish psalms in the first of these three words, and hymns known and remembered in the second, the natural explanation of the adjective specially alluded to in the third is that the "songs" or "odes" are such as were not merely "spiritual" in the later sense of <span class= "ital">the</span> word, but were the immediate outflow of the Spirit's working. Every analogy, it will be noticed, by which St. Paul illustrates his meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.">1Corinthians 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-7.htm" title="And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?">1Corinthians 14:7-8</a>, implies musical intonation. We have the sounding brass and the tinkling (or <span class= "ital">clanging</span>) cymbal, the pipe, the harp, the trumpet giving an uncertain sound. It falls in with this view that our Lord Himself compares <span class= "ital">the</span> new energy of spiritual life which He was about to impart to new wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm" title="Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runs out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.">Matthew 9:17</a>), and that the same comparison meets us in the Old Testament in the words in which Elihu describes his inspiration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-19.htm" title="Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.">Job 32:19</a>). The accounts of prophecy in its wider sense, as including song and praise, as well as a direct message to the minds and hearts of men, in the life of Saul, present Phenomena that are obviously analogous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-10.htm" title="And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.">1Samuel 10:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1Samuel 19:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm" title="And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Why they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?">1Samuel 19:24</a>). The brief accounts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>, "speaking with tongues and magnifying God," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>, where tongues are distinguished from prophecy, present nothing that is not in harmony with this explanation.<p>In the present case, however, there are exceptional phenomena. We cannot honestly interpret St. Luke's record without assuming either that the disciples spoke in the languages which are named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-9.htm" title="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,">Acts 2:9-11</a>, or that, speaking in their own Galilean tongue, their words came to the ears of those who listened as spoken in the language with which each was familiar. The first is at once the more natural interpretation of the language used by the historian, and, if we may use such a word of what is in itself supernatural and mysterious, the more conceivable of the two. And it is clear that there was an end to be attained by such an extension of the in this case which could not be attained otherwise. The disciples had been present in Jerusalem at many feasts before, at which they had found themselves, as now, surrounded by pilgrims from many distant lands. Then they had worshipped apart by themselves, with no outward means of fellowship with these strangers, and had poured out their praises and blessings in their own Galilean speech, as each group of those pilgrims had done in theirs. Now they found themselves able to burst through the bounds that had thus divided them, and to claim a fellowship with all true worshippers from whatever lands they came. But there is no evidence that that power was permanent. It came and went with the special outpouring of the Spirit, and lasted only while that lasted in its full intensity. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>.) There are no traces of its exercise in any narrative of the work of apostles and evangelists. They did their work in countries where Greek was spoken, even where it was not the native speech of the inhabitants, and so would not need that special knowledge. In the history of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.">Acts 14:11</a>, it is at least implied that Paul and Barnabas did not understand the speech of Lycaonia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Spirit</span> for <span class="accented">Ghost</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Other tongues</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11</a>); the same as the "new tongues" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-17.htm">Mark 16:17</a>. St. Paul speaks of them as "the tongues of men and of angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>), and as "kinds of tongues" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). His habitual phrase is "speaking in [or <span class="accented">with</span>] <span class="accented">a tongue</span> [or <span class="accented">tongues</span>]" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2, 4-6</a>, etc.), and the verb is always <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, as here. What these tongues were on this occasion we are explicitly informed in vers. 6, 8, and 11. They were the tongues of the various nationalities present at the feast - Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Phrygians, Arabians, etc. This is so clearly and so distinctly stated that it is astonishing that any one should deny it who accepts St. Luke's account as historical. The only room for doubt is whether the speakers spoke in these divers languages, or the hearers heard in them though the speakers spoke in only one tongue. But not to mention that this is far more difficult to imagine, and transfers the miracle from those who had the Holy Spirit to those who had it not, it is against the plain language of the text, which tells us that "they began to speak with other tongues," and that "every man heard them speaking in his own language." "Speaking," said they, "in our own tongues the mighty works of God." There <span class="accented">may</span>, indeed, have been something ecstatic besides in these utterances, but there is no reference to such made either by St. Luke or by the audience whose words he reports. The narrative before us does not hint at any after use of the gift of tongues for missionary purposes. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm">Acts 11:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a>, as well as in the passages above referred to in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the speaking with tongues is always spoken of - often in connection with prophecy - simply as a gift and a manifestation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>) of the power of the Holy Spirit. In this case and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a> the subject-matter of the utterance is the greatness of God's works; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2</a> it is" mysteries;" in ver. 15, "prayers and psalms;" in ver. 16 it is "blessing" and "thanksgiving" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). But nowhere, either in Holy Scripture or in the Fathers of the three first centuries, is the gift of tongues spoken of in connection with preaching to foreign nations (see Alford's just remarks). Farrar ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 98-101) takes the same view, but is much less distinct in his conception of what is meant here by speaking with tongues. He adheres to the view of Schneckenburger, that "the tongue was, from its own force and significance, intelligible equally to all who heard it;" he agrees with the dictum of Neander that "any foreign languages which were spoken on this occasion were only something accidental, and not the essential element of the language of the Spirit." He says, "The voice they uttered was awful in its range, in its tones, in its modulations, in its startling, penetrating, almost appalling power; the words they spoke were exalted, intense, passionate, full of mystic significance; the language they used was not their ordinary and familiar tongue, but was Hebrew, or Greek, or Latin, or Aramaic, or Persian, or Arabic, as some overpowering and unconscious impulse of the moment might direct... and among these strange sounds... there were some which none could interpret, which rang on the air like the voice of barbarous languages, and which ... conveyed no definite significance beyond the fact that they were reverberations of one and the same ecstasy." The writer seems to suggest that when any real language was spoken it was one more or less known previously by the speaker, and that in other cases it was no language at all, only thrilling emotional sounds. Renan's view of the day of Pentecost is a carious specimen of rationalistic interpretation. "One day when the brethren were come together there was a tempest. A violent wind burst open the windows, and the sky was one sheet of fire. In that climate tempests are often accompanied by an extraordinary amount of electric light. The atmosphere is on all sides furrowed with jets of flame. On this occasion, whether the electric fluid actually passed through the room, or whether the faces of all present were suddenly lit up by an extremely bright flash of lightning, all were convinced that the Holy Spirit had entered their assembly, and had sat upon the head of each in the shape of a tongue of fire... In these moments of ecstasy, the disciple possessed by the Spirit uttered sounds 'inarticulate and incoherent, which the hearers fancied were the words of a strange language, and in their simplicity tried to interpret They listened eagerly to the medley of sounds, and explained them by their own extemporaneous thoughts. Each of them had recourse to his own native <span class="accented">patois</span> to supply some meaning to the unintelligible accents, and generally succeeded in affixing to them the thoughts that were uppermost in his own mind" ('Les Apotres,' pp. 66-68). Elsewhere (pp. 64, 65) he suggests that the whole conception of <span class="accented">speaking with tongues</span> arose from the anticipation on the part of the apostles that great difficulty would arise in propagating the gospel from the impossibility of learning to speak the necessary languages. The solution with some was that, under the ecstasy caused by the Holy Spirit, the hearers would be able to translate what they heard into their own tongue; others rather thought that by the same power the apostles would be able to speak any dialect they pleased at the moment. Hence the conception of the day of Pentecost as described by St. Luke! Meyer, again, fully admits, as "beyond all doubt," that St. Luke intended to narrate that the persons possessed by the Spirit spoke in foreign languages previously unknown by them; but adds that "the sudden communication of a facility of speaking foreign languages is neither logically possible nor psychologically and morally conceivable" (a pretty bold assertion); and therefore he sets down St. Luke's account of what occurred as "a later legendary formation," based upon the existing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Zeller, traveling a little further on the same road, comes to the conclusion that "the narrative before us is not based on any definite fact" (p. 205). Leaving, however, these fanciful varieties of incredulous criticism, and interpreting the statements of this chapter by the later spiritual gifts as seen in the Church of Corinth, we conclude that the" tongues" were sometimes "tongues of men," foreign languages unknown to the speakers, and of course unintelligible to the hearers unless any were present, as was the case on the day of Pentecost, who knew the language; and sometimes languages not of earth but of heaven, "<span class="accented">tongues</span> of angels." But there is no evidence whatever of their being mere gibberish as distinct from <span class="accented">language</span>, or being language coined at the moment by the Holy Ghost. All that St. Paul says to the Corinthians is fully applicable to any language spoken when there were none present who understood it. The significance of the miracle seems to be that it points to the time when all shall be one in Christ, and shall all speak and understand the same speech; and not only all men, but men and angels, "<span class="accented">the</span> whole family in heaven and earth," "<span class="accented">things</span> in the heavens and things upon the earth" all gathered together in one in Christ. It may also not improbably have been used occasionally, as it was on the day of Pentecost, to convey doctrine, knowledge, or exhortation, to foreign people; but there is no distinct evidence that this was the case. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 We cannot forget how often, while their Master was with them there were strifes among the disciples which should be the greatest; but now all these strifes were at an end. They had prayed more together of late. Would we have the Spirit poured out upon us from on high, let us be all of one accord. And notwithstanding differences of sentiments and interests, as there were among those disciples, let us agree to love one another; for where brethren dwell together in unity, there the Lord commands his blessing. A rushing mighty wind came with great force. This was to signify the powerful influences and working of the Spirit of God upon the minds of men, and thereby upon the world. Thus the convictions of the Spirit make way for his comforts; and the rough blasts of that blessed wind, prepare the soul for its soft and gentle gales. There was an appearance of something like flaming fire, lighting on every one of them, according to John Baptist's saying concerning Christ; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. The Spirit, like fire, melts the heart, burns up the dross, and kindles pious and devout affections in the soul; in which, as in the fire on the altar, the spiritual sacrifices are offered up. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than before. They were filled with the graces of the Spirit, and more than ever under his sanctifying influences; more weaned from this world, and better acquainted with the other. They were more filled with the comforts of the Spirit, rejoiced more than ever in the love of Christ and the hope of heaven: in it all their griefs and fears were swallowed up. They were filled with the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they had miraculous powers for the furtherance of the gospel. They spake, not from previous though or meditation, but as the Spirit gave them utterance.</body></html>
