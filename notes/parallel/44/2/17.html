The people were suffering from one of the locust-plagues of the East and its consequent famine. The prophet calls them to repentance, and promises this gift of the Spirit as the great blessing of a far-off future. He had been taught that no true knowledge of God comes but through that Spirit. So Elisha prayed that a double portion (i.e., the eldest son's inheritance) of the Spirit which God had given to Elijah might rest upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.">2Kings 2:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.</span>--The Old Testament use of the word, in its wider generic sense, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the case of Saul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm" title="And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.">1Samuel 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1Samuel 19:20-24</a>, covered phenomena analogous to the gift of tongues as well as that of prophecy in the New Testament sense. The words imply that women as well as men had been filled with the Spirit, and had spoken with the "tongues."<p><span class= "bld">Your young men shall see visions.</span>--The "visions," implying the full activity of spiritual power, are thought of as belonging to the younger prophets. In the calmer state of more advanced age, wisdom came, as in the speech of Elihu, "in a dream, in visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-15.htm" title="In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumberings on the bed;">Job 33:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Be</span> for <span class="accented">come to pass</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">pour forth</span> for <span class="accented">pour out</span>, A.V. In the last days. This does not agree with either the Hebrew or the LXX. in the existing texts, where we read merely <span class="accented">afterwards</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> The phrase, "in the last days," which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> and elsewhere, denotes the days of Messiah. St. Peter is perhaps expounding the passage as relating to the days of Messiah; or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> may have been another reading. <span class="cmt_word">Saith God</span> is no part of Joel's prophecy, but Peter's words. <span class="cmt_word">Your young men shall see</span> visions, etc. The order of this and the following clause is inverted. In the Hebrew and LXX. the <span class="accented">old men</span> are mentioned first. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-21 Peter's sermon shows that he was thoroughly recovered from his fall, and thoroughly restored to the Divine favour; for he who had denied Christ, now boldly confessed him. His account of the miraculous pouring forth of the Spirit, was designed to awaken the hearers to embrace the faith of Christ, and to join themselves to his church. It was the fulfilling the Scripture, and the fruit of Christ's resurrection and ascension, and proof of both. Though Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues as the Spirit gave him utterance, yet he did not think to set aside the Scriptures. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bible; and the Spirit is given, not to do away the Scriptures, but to enable us to understand, approve, and obey them. Assuredly none will escape the condemnation of the great day, except those who call upon the name of the Lord, in and through his Son Jesus Christ, as the Saviour of sinners, and the Judge of all mankind.</body></html>
