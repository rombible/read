(1) They grew in knowledge of the truth by attending to the <span class= "ital">teaching</span> of the Apostles. This, and not the thought of a formulated doctrine to which they gave their consent, is clearly the meaning of the word. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-28.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:">Matthew 7:28</a>.) (2) They joined in outward acts of fellowship with each other, acts of common worship, acts of mutual kindness and benevolence. The one Greek word diverges afterwards into the sense of what we technically call "communion," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1Corinthians 10:16</a>, and that of a "collection" or contribution for the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;">2Corinthians 9:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span>--(3) St. Luke uses the phrase, we must remember, in the sense which, when he wrote, it had acquired in St. Paul's hands. It can have no meaning less solemn than the commemorative "breaking of bread," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1Corinthians 10:16</a>. From the very first what was afterwards known as the Lord's Supper (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20</a>) took its place with baptism as a permanent universal element in the Church's life. At first, it would seem, the evening meal of every day was such a supper. Afterwards the two elements that had then been united were developed separately, the social into the <span class= "ital">Agap?, </span>or Feasts of Love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>, and--though here there is a various-reading--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>), the other into the Communion, or Eucharistic Sacrifice. (4) Prayer, in like manner, included private as well as public devotions. These may have been the outpouring of the heart's desires; but they may also have been what the disciples had been taught to pray, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.">Luke 11:1</a>, as the disciples of John had been taught. The use of the plural seems to indicate recurring times of prayer at fixed hours.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> <span class="accented">- Teaching</span> for <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, A.V.; in <span class="accented">the breaking</span> for <span class="accented">and in breaking</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the prayers</span> for <span class="accented">in prayer</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And fellowship</span>; better, as in the margin, <span class="accented">in fellowship</span>; not meaning the apostles' fellowship, but <span class="accented">the fellowship</span> of the Church - that common life of close brotherhood in which all that they did was done in common, and all that they possessed was possessed in common, so that there seemed to be but one heart and one mind amongst them all. <span class="cmt_word">Breaking of bread</span>; in the Holy Eucharist (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-22.htm">Mark 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The prayers</span>; the common prayers of the Church. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:42-47 In these verses we have the history of the truly primitive church, of the first days of it; its state of infancy indeed, but, like that, the state of its greatest innocence. They kept close to holy ordinances, and abounded in piety and devotion; for Christianity, when admitted in the power of it, will dispose the soul to communion with God in all those ways wherein he has appointed us to meet him, and has promised to meet us. The greatness of the event raised them above the world, and the Holy Ghost filled them with such love, as made every one to be to another as to himself, and so made all things common, not by destroying property, but doing away selfishness, and causing charity. And God who moved them to it, knew that they were quickly to be driven from their possessions in Judea. The Lord, from day to day, inclined the hearts of more to embrace the gospel; not merely professors, but such as were actually brought into a state of acceptance with God, being made partakers of regenerating grace. Those whom God has designed for eternal salvation, shall be effectually brought to Christ, till the earth is filled with the knowledge of his glory.</body></html>
