But they remembered that He had claimed it as His Father's house, that His zeal for that house had been as a consuming passion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/2-16.htm" title="And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.">John 2:16-17</a>), and therefore they had attended its worship daily before the Day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-53.htm" title="And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.">Luke 24:53</a>); and it was not less, but infinitely more, precious to them now, as the place where they could meet with God, than it had been in the days of ignorance, before they had known the Christ, and through Him had learnt to know the Father. The apparent strangeness of their being allowed to meet in the Temple is explained partly by the fact that its courts were open to all Israelites who did not disturb its peace, partly by the existence of a moderate half-believing party in the Sanhedrin itself, including Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathaea, and Gamaliel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35</a>); and by the popularity gained for a time by the holiness and liberal almsgiving of the new community.<p><span class= "bld">Breaking bread from house to house.</span>--Better, with the margin, <span class= "ital">at home</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in their own house. The Greek phrase may have a distributive force, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-5.htm" title="Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.">Romans 16:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you.

They met in the Temple, they met also in what, in the modern sense of the word, would be the "church" of the new society, for the act of worship, above all, for the highest act of worship and of fellowship, for which the Temple was, of course, unsuitable.<p><span class= "bld">Did eat their meat</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--We have again the tense which implies a customary act. The words imply that as yet the solemn breaking of bread was closely connected with their daily life. Anticipating the language of a few years later, the Agape, or Love-feast, was united with the Eucharistic Communion. The higher sanctified the lower. It was not till love and faith were colder that men were forced to separate them, lest (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-21</a>) the lower should desecrate the higher.<p><span class= "bld">Gladness and singleness of heart.</span>--This "gladness" is significant. The word was the same as that which had been used by the angel to Zacharias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-44.htm" title="For, see, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.">Luke 1:44</a>) in announcing the birth of the Forerunner. The verb from which the noun was derived had been employed by our Lord when He bade His disciples rejoice and be glad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm" title="Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.">Matthew 5:12</a>). The literal meaning of the word translated "singleness," which does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, was the smoothness of a soil without stones. Thence it came to be used for evenness and simplicity, unity of character; thence for that unity showing itself in love; thence, by a further transition, for unalloyed benevolence, showing itself in act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> <span class="accented">- Day by day continuing steadfastly</span> for <span class="accented">they continuing daily</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">at home for from house to house</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they did take their food</span> for <span class="accented">did eat their meat</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In the temple</span>. It is very remarkable that at this early age of the Church's existence Christians did not deem themselves separated from their Jewish brethren, or from the Old Testament institutions. Christianity was but Judaism perfected; the gospel the full blossoming of the Law. The first Christian Jews, therefore, did not conceive of themselves as quitting the religion of their fathers, but rather hoped that their whole nation would in a short time acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ. Christian institutions, therefore - the prayers, the breaking of bread, the prophesyings and speaking with tongues, and the apostolic teachings - were supplemental to the temple service, not antagonistic to it; and the church took the place rather of the synagogue than of the temple (see 'Dict. of Bible:' "Synagogue"). <span class="cmt_word">At home.</span> This version hardly represents the true idea of the original; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> represents the private Christian place of meeting, as contrasted with the temple. The meaning is not that every disciple broke bread in his own house, but that they broke bread at the house where the Christian assemblies were held, whether one or more. We have already seen the Church gathered together "in an upper room" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>), in "one place," in "a house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1, 2</a>), and "together" (ver. 44; see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>); and we know that as the synagogue was called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, house of prayer, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, the house of assemblage, so the Christian place of meeting was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the Lord's house, whence the word "<span class="accented">church."</span> (For <span class="accented">breaking bread, see</span> above, ver. 42.) They did take their food. The link of connection is the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span> or love-feast, which formed an important part of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or common life, of the early Christians. The whole description is a beautiful picture of Christian unity, piety, love, and joy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:42-47 In these verses we have the history of the truly primitive church, of the first days of it; its state of infancy indeed, but, like that, the state of its greatest innocence. They kept close to holy ordinances, and abounded in piety and devotion; for Christianity, when admitted in the power of it, will dispose the soul to communion with God in all those ways wherein he has appointed us to meet him, and has promised to meet us. The greatness of the event raised them above the world, and the Holy Ghost filled them with such love, as made every one to be to another as to himself, and so made all things common, not by destroying property, but doing away selfishness, and causing charity. And God who moved them to it, knew that they were quickly to be driven from their possessions in Judea. The Lord, from day to day, inclined the hearts of more to embrace the gospel; not merely professors, but such as were actually brought into a state of acceptance with God, being made partakers of regenerating grace. Those whom God has designed for eternal salvation, shall be effectually brought to Christ, till the earth is filled with the knowledge of his glory.</body></html>
