The words are three synonyms, expressing different aspects of the same facts, rather than a classification of phenomena. The leading thought, in the first word, is the power displayed in the act; in the second, the marvel of it as a portent: in the third, its character as a token or note of something beyond itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- Unto you</span> for <span class="accented">among you</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">mighty works</span> for <span class="accented">miracles</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">even as ye yourselves know</span> for <span class="accented">as ye yourselves also know</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Ye men of Israel</span>. This title includes both the Jews of Judaea and all those of the dispersion, to whatever tribe they belonged. <span class="cmt_word">Approved of God</span>. Observe the distinct reference to the miracles of Christ, as the proofs that he came from God, the authenticating evidences of his Divine mission. So St. Peter again, in his address to Cornelius, declares how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). The miracles of the gospel are, and were intended to be, a demonstration of the truth of Christianity, and it is at their peril that Christians allow themselves to give up this argument at the bidding of the skeptic. <span class="cmt_word">Mighty works and wonders and signs</span>. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> are <span class="accented">powers</span>, acts of healing and such like, done by the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit (see the above reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> are <span class="accented">wonders</span> or <span class="accented">portents</span>, such as are spoken of by the Prophet Joel, "wonders in heaven above," the darkening of the sun, the discoloration or the moon, or any ether wonder considered only with reference to its portentous character; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> are <span class="accented">signs</span>, not necessarily miraculous, but things which are proofs, either by their miraculous character or from the time or mode of their occurrence, of the truth of the things spoken. "Miracles, wonders, and signs" occur together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>. The three seem to include every kind of miracle, or, as Meyer says, miracles viewed <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to their <span class="accented">nature,</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> according to their <span class="accented">appearance,</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> according to their <span class="accented">destination</span> or proposed end. <span class="cmt_word">Which God did by him</span>. So we read <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "Through [or 'by'] whom also he made the worlds." And so our Lord said of himself, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work;" and "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 19</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). On the other hand, our Lord often speaks of his own power, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). As Mediator, Christ did all things by his Father's appointment, and for his Father's glory, Even as ye yours, elves know. Mark the confidence with which Peter appeals to their personal knowledge of the miracles of Christ. This was a fitting preparation for the announcement of that mighty power, wonder, and sign which he was now about to proclaim to them - the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:22-36 From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: and here is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.</body></html>
