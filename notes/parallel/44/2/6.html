The question still remains whether <span class="accented">the sound</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) refers to the sound (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of the <span class="accented">rushing mighty wind</span> mentioned in ver. 2, or to the <span class="accented">voices</span> of those who spake with tongues. If the last, we should rather have expected <span class="accented">sounds</span> or <span class="accented">voices</span> in the plural; and it is further in favor of the former that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> seems to take up the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 2. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> is applied to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>. Nor is it likely, at first sight, that the disciples in the house where they were sitting should have spoken loud enough to attract the notice of people outside. Whereas the sound of a rushing mighty wind, sufficient (as in Acts 3:31) to shake the house, would naturally he heard by passers-by. On the other hand, however, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> seems to point decisively to the human voice (see its use, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-7.htm">1 Corinthians 14:7-10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-13 The difference in languages which arose at Babel, has much hindered the spread of knowledge and religion. The instruments whom the Lord first employed in spreading the Christian religion, could have made no progress without this gift, which proved that their authority was from God.</body></html>
