Not four years had passed since there had been a like eagerness to rush to the baptism of John. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-12.htm" title="And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.">Matthew 11:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Three thousand souls.</span>--The largeness of the number has been urged as rendering it probable that the baptism was by affusion, not immersion. On the other hand, (1) immersion had clearly been practised by John, and was involved in the original meaning of the word, and it is not likely that the rite should have been curtailed of its full proportions at the very outset. (2) The symbolic meaning of the act required immersion in order that it might be clearly manifested, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>, seem almost of necessity to imply the more complete mode. The swimming-baths of Bethesda and Siloam (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-7.htm" title="The weak man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.">John 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7</a>), or the so-called Fountain of the Virgin, near the Temple enclosure, or the bathing-places within the Tower of Antony (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>v. 5, ? 8), may well have helped to make the process easy. The sequel shows (1) that many converts were made from the Hellenistic Jews who were present at the Feast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>); and (2) that few, if any, of the converts were of the ruling class (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1</a>). It is obvious that some of these converts may have gone back to the cities whence they came, and may have been the unknown founders of the Church at Damascus, or Alexandria, or Rome itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> <span class="accented">- They then</span> for <span class="accented">then they</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">received</span> for <span class="accented">gladly received</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">there were added unto them in that day</span> for <span class="accented">the same day there were added unto them</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Gladly received</span>.

But neither Peter's words, nor the miracle they witnessed, could have produced such effects, had not the Holy Spirit been given. Sinners, when their eyes are opened, cannot but be pricked to the heart for sin, cannot but feel an inward uneasiness. The apostle exhorted them to repent of their sins, and openly to avow their belief in Jesus as the Messiah, by being baptized in his name. Thus professing their faith in Him, they would receive remission of their sins, and partake of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit. To separate from wicked people, is the only way to save ourselves from them. Those who repent of their sins, and give up themselves to Jesus Christ, must prove their sincerity by breaking off from the wicked. We must save ourselves from them; which denotes avoiding them with dread and holy fear. By God's grace three thousand persons accepted the gospel invitation. There can be no doubt that the gift of the Holy Ghost, which they all received, and from which no true believer has ever been shut out, was that Spirit of adoption, that converting, guiding, sanctifying grace, which is bestowed upon all the members of the family of our heavenly Father. Repentance and remission of sins are still preached to the chief of sinners, in the Redeemer's name; still the Holy Spirit seals the blessing on the believer's heart; still the encouraging promises are to us and our children; and still the blessings are offered to all that are afar off.</body></html>
