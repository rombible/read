It was the "feast of harvest, the feast of the firstfruits;" and so it was meet that it should witness the first great gathering of the fields that were white to harvest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a>). It was one on which, more than on any other, the Israelite was to remember that he had been a bondsman in the land of Egypt, and had been led forth to freedom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-12.htm" title="And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.">Deuteronomy 16:12</a>), and on it, accordingly, they were to do no servile work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm" title="You shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:31</a>); and it was, therefore, a fit time for the gift of the Spirit, of whom it was emphatically true that "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2Corinthians 3:17</a>), and who was to guide the Church into the truth which should make men free indeed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-32.htm" title="And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.">John 8:32</a>). It was a day on which sacrifices of every kind were offered--burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and meat offerings, and peace offerings--and so represented the consecration of body, soul, and spirit as a spiritual sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17-20</a>). As on the Passover the first ripe sheaf of corn was waved before Jehovah as the type of the sacrifice of Christ, of the corn of wheat which is not quickened except it die (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:">Leviticus 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24</a>), so on Pentecost two wave-loaves of fine flour were to be offered, the type, it may be, under the light now thrown on them, of the Jewish and the Gentile Churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17</a>). And these loaves were to be leavened, as a witness that the process of the contact of mind with mind, which--as the prohibition of leaven in the Passover ritual bore witness--is naturally so fruitful in evil, might yet, under a higher influence, become one of unspeakable good: the new life working through the three measures of meal until the whole was leavened. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-33.htm" title="Another parable spoke he to them; The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.">Matthew 13:33</a>.)<p>(2) <span class= "bld">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven. . . .</span>--The description reminds us of the "sound of a trumpet" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm" title="And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.">Exodus 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-19.htm" title="And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:">Hebrews 12:19</a>) on Sinai, of the "great and strong wind" that rent the mountains on Horeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm" title="And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:">1Kings 19:11</a>). Such a wind was now felt and heard, even as the wind, the breath, the Spirit of God, had moved upon the face of the waters, quickening them into life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm" title="And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.">Genesis 1:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A rushing mighty wind.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a mighty breath borne onwards, </span>so as to connect the English, as the Greek is connected, with St. Peter's words that, "holy men of old spake as they were moved (literally, <span class= "ital">borne on</span>) by the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>). The Greek word for "wind" is not that commonly so translated (<span class= "ital">anemos</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but one from the same root as the Greek for "Spirit" (<span class= "ital">Pnoe</span> and <span class= "ital">Pneuma</span>--both from <span class= "ital">Pneo, </span>"I breathe"), and rendered "breath" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-25.htm" title="Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;">Acts 17:25</a>. It is obviously chosen here as being better fitted than the more common word for the supernatural inbreathing of which they were conscious, and which to many must have recalled the moment when their Lord had "<span class= "ital">breathed</span> on them, and said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-22.htm" title="And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:">John 20:22</a>). Now, once more, they felt that light yet awful breathing which wrought every nerve to ecstasy; and it filled "the whole house," as if in token of the wide range over which the new spiritual power was to extend its working, even unto the whole Church, which is the House of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1Timothy 3:15</a>), and to the uttermost parts of the earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- From heaven a sound</span> for a <span class="accented">sound from heaven</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as of the rushing of a</span> for <span class="accented">as of a rushing</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>All the house;</span> showing that it was in a private dwelling, not in the temple (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>) that they were assembled (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>). Perhaps the word "church" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) derives its use from these early meetings of the disciples in a <span class="accented">house</span>, as distinguished from the temple (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 We cannot forget how often, while their Master was with them there were strifes among the disciples which should be the greatest; but now all these strifes were at an end. They had prayed more together of late. Would we have the Spirit poured out upon us from on high, let us be all of one accord. And notwithstanding differences of sentiments and interests, as there were among those disciples, let us agree to love one another; for where brethren dwell together in unity, there the Lord commands his blessing. A rushing mighty wind came with great force. This was to signify the powerful influences and working of the Spirit of God upon the minds of men, and thereby upon the world. Thus the convictions of the Spirit make way for his comforts; and the rough blasts of that blessed wind, prepare the soul for its soft and gentle gales. There was an appearance of something like flaming fire, lighting on every one of them, according to John Baptist's saying concerning Christ; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. The Spirit, like fire, melts the heart, burns up the dross, and kindles pious and devout affections in the soul; in which, as in the fire on the altar, the spiritual sacrifices are offered up. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than before. They were filled with the graces of the Spirit, and more than ever under his sanctifying influences; more weaned from this world, and better acquainted with the other. They were more filled with the comforts of the Spirit, rejoiced more than ever in the love of Christ and the hope of heaven: in it all their griefs and fears were swallowed up. They were filled with the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they had miraculous powers for the furtherance of the gospel. They spake, not from previous though or meditation, but as the Spirit gave them utterance.</body></html>
