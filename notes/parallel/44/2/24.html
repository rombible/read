If we take the Greek word in its full meaning, the Resurrection is thought of as a new birth as from the womb of the grave.<p><span class= "bld">Because it was not possible</span>. . . .--The moral impossibility was, we may say, two-fold. The work of the Son of Man could not have ended in a failure and death which would have given the lie to all that He had asserted of Himself. Its issue could not run counter to the prophecies which had implied with more or less clearness a victory over death. The latter, as the sequel shows, was the thought prominent in St. Peter's mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- Raised</span> for <span class="accented">hath raised</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">pangs</span> for <span class="accented">pains</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Pangs</span>. St. Luke follows the LXX., who render the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-3.htm">Psalm 116:3</a>, by <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, as if the Hebrew word were <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, the <span class="accented">pains</span> or <span class="accented">pangs</span> of a woman in childbirth, whereas it really is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, a cord, as it is rendered in the margin of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>, meaning the <span class="accented">snare</span> of the fowler. The variation is very similar to that of the "<span class="accented">fruit</span> of our lips" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>, compared with the "<span class="accented">calves</span> of our lips" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>.

Why, <span class="accented">not possible?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Because of the union of the Godhead and manhood in the one Person of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Because of God's character, which makes it impossible that one who trusts in him should be forsaken, or that God's Holy One should see corruption. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Because the Scripture, which cannot be broken, declared the resurrection of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:22-36 From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: and here is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.</body></html>
