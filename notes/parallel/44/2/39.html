It is the essence of St. Peter's appeal that all to whom he speaks can claim the promise as fully as himself. The phrase "those that are afar off," was probably wide enough to cover both the Jews of the Dispersion, to whom the Apostle afterwards wrote (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1-2</a>), and the heathen nations among whom they lived. The use of the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>, inclines rather to the latter meaning.<p><span class= "bld">Even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</span>--There seems, at first sight, a limitation on the universality of the previous words. And in some sense there is; but it is not more than is involved in the fact that spiritual knowledge and culture are not bestowed on all nations and ages alike. Wherever there is a difference, some possessing a higher knowledge and greater power than others, the Apostle could only see, not chance, or evolution, but the working of a divine purpose, calling some to special privileges, and yet dealing equitably with all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> <span class="accented">- To you is the promise</span> for <span class="accented">the promise is unto you</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">shall call unto him</span> for <span class="accented">shall call<span class="cmt_word">.</span> To you is the promise</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>).

The fulfilment to the Gentiles is specially recorded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-45.htm">Acts 10:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm">Acts 11:15, 18</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Shall call unto him</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-6.htm">Romans 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a> (etc.), which confirm the application of the "afar off" to the Gentiles. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:37-41 From the first delivery of that Divine message, it appeared that there was Divine power going with it; and thousands were brought to the obedience of faith. But neither Peter's words, nor the miracle they witnessed, could have produced such effects, had not the Holy Spirit been given. Sinners, when their eyes are opened, cannot but be pricked to the heart for sin, cannot but feel an inward uneasiness. The apostle exhorted them to repent of their sins, and openly to avow their belief in Jesus as the Messiah, by being baptized in his name. Thus professing their faith in Him, they would receive remission of their sins, and partake of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit. To separate from wicked people, is the only way to save ourselves from them. Those who repent of their sins, and give up themselves to Jesus Christ, must prove their sincerity by breaking off from the wicked. We must save ourselves from them; which denotes avoiding them with dread and holy fear. By God's grace three thousand persons accepted the gospel invitation. There can be no doubt that the gift of the Holy Ghost, which they all received, and from which no true believer has ever been shut out, was that Spirit of adoption, that converting, guiding, sanctifying grace, which is bestowed upon all the members of the family of our heavenly Father. Repentance and remission of sins are still preached to the chief of sinners, in the Redeemer's name; still the Holy Spirit seals the blessing on the believer's heart; still the encouraging promises are to us and our children; and still the blessings are offered to all that are afar off.</body></html>
