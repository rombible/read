As interpreted by St. Peter's words in his Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>), the words conveyed to his mind the thought which has been embodied in the article of the "Descent into Hell," or <span class= "ital">Hades, </span>in the Apostle's Creed. The death of Christ was an actual death, and while the body was laid in the grave, the soul passed into the world of the dead, the <span class= "ital">Sheol</span> of the Hebrews, the <span class= "ital">Hades</span> of the Greeks, to carry on there the redemptive work which had been begun on earth. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-34.htm" title="And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.">Acts 13:34-37</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9</a>.) Here again we have an interesting coincidence with St. Peter's language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>), as to the work of Christ in preaching to the "spirits in prison."<p><span class= "bld">Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</span>--The word for "holy" is different from that commonly so rendered, and conveys the idea of personal piety and godliness rather than consecration. As the Psalmist used the words, we may think of them as expressing the confidence that he himself, as loving, and beloved of, God, would be delivered from destruction, both now and hereafter. St. Peter had learnt to interpret the words as having received a higher fulfilment. Christ was, in this sense, as well as in that expressed by the other word, "the Holy One" of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-34.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are; the Holy One of God.">Luke 4:34</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm" title="Who shall not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? for you only are holy: for all nations shall come and worship before you; for your judgments are made manifest.">Revelation 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5</a>, this very word is applied to Christ. The Hebrew text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a> presents the various reading of "the holy ones," as if referring to the "saints that are upon the earth," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm" title="And there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat on each of them.">Acts 2:3</a>. The LXX., which St. Peter follows, gives the singular, which is indeed essential to his argument, and this is also the reading of the Masoretic text. The Greek word for "corruption" ranges in its meaning from "decay" to "destruction." The Hebrew to which it answers is primarily the "pit" of the grave, and not "corruption," or "wasting away."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> <span class="accented">- Hades</span> for <span class="accented">hell</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">give thy Holy One</span> for <span class="accented">suffer thine Holy One</span>, A.V., surely not so good a rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Hades</span>. The "hell" of the A.V. is the exact English representative of <span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The article in the Creed, "He descended into hell," is based upon this text especially, the other two alleged in support of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18, 19</a>) being less conclusive (see Pearson on the Creed, art. 5.).

The Hebrew word always means <span class="accented">a pit</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>); but the LXX. here render it <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, as if from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (in Pihel, to destroy, waste; in Hophal and Niphal, to be corrupted, spoilt, to rot). In the A.V. it is rendered <span class="accented">corruption</span>, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>, where it answers to "the worms," in the parallel clause. It is very probable that the LXX. are right. Nothing is more common than for Hebrew verbs to take the meaning of verbs with similar radicals. <span class="cmt_word">Holy One</span>. So the LXX. and the Keri of the Hebrew text. But the Cethib has <span class="accented">Holy Ones</span> in the plural. It is obvious that the singular, <span class="accented">Holy One</span>, agrees far better with the singulars which precede and follow <span class="accented">it - my</span> heart, <span class="accented">my</span> glory, <span class="accented">my</span> flesh, <span class="accented">my</span> soul, thou wilt show me - than the plural, which is entirely out of place. The two clauses taken together show the full liberation of Christ from the dominion of death - that of his human soul from bell, and that of his body from the grave before it saw corruption (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-34.htm">Acts 13:34-37</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:22-36 From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: and here is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.</body></html>
