The Greek words for "possessions" and "goods" both mean "property," the former as a thing acquired, the latter as that which belongs to a man for the time being. Custom, however, had introduced a technical distinction, and "possessions" stands for real property, "goods" for personal. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-1.htm" title="But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,">Acts 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-3.htm" title="But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?">Acts 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-8.htm" title="And Peter answered to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.">Acts 5:8</a>, the former word is used interchangeably with that which is translated "field," and in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-10.htm" title="Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:">Proverbs 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-16.htm" title="She considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.">Proverbs 31:16</a>, is used both for "field" and "vineyard."<p><span class= "bld">As every man had need.</span>--The words imply at least the endeavour to discriminate. The money was not given literally to every one who applied for it, and so the way was prepared for more fixed and definite rules.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> <span class="accented">- They sold</span> for <span class="accented">sold</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">all</span> for <span class="accented">all men</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">according as any</span> for as <span class="accented">every</span>, A.V. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:42-47 In these verses we have the history of the truly primitive church, of the first days of it; its state of infancy indeed, but, like that, the state of its greatest innocence. They kept close to holy ordinances, and abounded in piety and devotion; for Christianity, when admitted in the power of it, will dispose the soul to communion with God in all those ways wherein he has appointed us to meet him, and has promised to meet us. The greatness of the event raised them above the world, and the Holy Ghost filled them with such love, as made every one to be to another as to himself, and so made all things common, not by destroying property, but doing away selfishness, and causing charity. And God who moved them to it, knew that they were quickly to be driven from their possessions in Judea. The Lord, from day to day, inclined the hearts of more to embrace the gospel; not merely professors, but such as were actually brought into a state of acceptance with God, being made partakers of regenerating grace. Those whom God has designed for eternal salvation, shall be effectually brought to Christ, till the earth is filled with the knowledge of his glory.</body></html>
