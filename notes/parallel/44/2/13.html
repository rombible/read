The Greek word was sometimes used, like the Latin <span class= "ital">mustum, </span>for the unfermented grape-juice. Here, however, the context shows that wine, in the strict sense of the word, was intended, and the use of the same word in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-19.htm" title="Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.">Job 32:19</a> confirms this meaning. The word for "new wine" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm" title="Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runs out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.">Matthew 9:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-22.htm" title="And no man puts new wine into old bottles: else the new wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.">Mark 2:22</a>, is different, but there also (see Notes) fermentation is implied. The words, as has been said above (Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>), point to a certain appearance of excitement in tone, manner, and words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - But <span class="accented">others</span> for <span class="accented">others</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">they are filled with</span> for <span class="accented">these men are full of</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>New wine</span>; more literally, <span class="accented">sweet wine.</span> These mockers, men incapable of serious and devout appreciation of the work of the Holy Spirit, attributed the tension of feeling which they saw, and the unintelligible words which they heard, to the effect of wine. So Festus said," Paul, thou art mad." So the unbelieving Jews of Pontus and Asia <span class="accented">thought it strange</span> that the Christians should live holily, and spake evil of them in consequence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4, 14</a>). So Ishmael mocked Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>); and so in all times "they that are born after the flesh do persecute them that are born after the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-29.htm">Galatians 4:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-13 The difference in languages which arose at Babel, has much hindered the spread of knowledge and religion.
