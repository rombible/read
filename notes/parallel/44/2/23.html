The coincidence is not without its force as bearing on the genuineness both of the speech and of the letter.

But it may with equal propriety be applied to the action of the chief priests and elders in delivering Jesus to Pontius Pilate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>)to be crucified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a>).

Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.</body></html>
