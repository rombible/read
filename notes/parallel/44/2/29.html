In the Greek version of the Old Testament it is used only of the comparatively subordinate "chief of the fathers" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-9.htm" title="And their brothers, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six.

Josephus relates that vast treasures were buried with him (<span class= "ital">Ant. vii.</span> 15, ? 4), and that John Hyrcanus opened one of the chambers of the tomb, and took out three thousand talents to pay the tribute demanded by Antiochus the Pious (<span class= "ital">Ant. xiii.</span> 8, ? 4). Herod the Great also opened it and found no money, but gold and silver vessels in abundance. The tradition was that he sought to penetrate into the inner vault, in which the bodies of David and Solomon were resting, and was deterred by a flame that issued from the recess (<span class= "ital">Ant. xvi.</span> 7, ? 1). It is difficult to understand how such a treasure could have escaped the plunderer in all the sieges and sacks to which Jerusalem had been exposed; but it is possible that its fame as a holy place may have made it, like the temples at Delphi and Ephesus, a kind of bank of deposit, in which large treasures in coin or plate were left for safety, and many of these, in the common course of things, were never claimed, and gradually accumulated. The monuments now known as the "tombs of the kings" on the north side of the city, though identified by De Sauley with the sepulchres of the house of David, are of the Roman period, and are outside the walls. David and his successors were probably buried in a vault on the eastern hill, in the city of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-10.htm" title="So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.">1Kings 2:10</a>), within the range of the enclosure now known as the <span class= "ital">Haram</span> Area.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> <span class="accented">- Brethren</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">I may say unto you freely</span> for <span class="accented">let me freely speak unto you</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">both died and was buried</span> for <span class="accented">is both dead and buried</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tomb</span> for <span class="accented">sepulcher</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren</span>; literally, <span class="accented">men who are my brethren.</span> Observe how gentle and conciliatory the apostle's language is; how exactly in accordance with his own precept (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8, 9</a>), "Not rendering railing for railing," etc. In addressing them as <span class="accented">brethren</span>, he silently claims the good will and fairness due to one who was a brother in blood and in the faith of the God of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The patriarch David</span>.

It is a title of dignity, signifying the head of a house. It seems to be here applied to David, because he is spoken of as head of the family from which Christ sprang. Abraham was the head of the whole Hebrew race: "Abraham our father." The twelve patriarchs were the heads of their respective tribes. The LXX. use the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "chief of the fathers' houses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-12.htm">2 Chronicles 26:12</a>); which they elsewhere render by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>, etc.). In common parlance, the term is also applied to those chief persons who lived before the time of Moses, and have their record in his books. <span class="cmt_word">His tomb is with us</span>, etc. Josephus speaks of David's tomb (calling it, as St. Peter here does, his <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) as consisting of several chambers, and relates how one of these chambers was opened by the high priest Hyrcanus, who took from it three thousand talents of gold to give to Antiochus Pins, who was at that time laying siege to Jerusalem. He adds that another chamber was opened later by King Herod, who abstracted a great quantity of golden ornaments from it; but that neither of them penetrated to the vaults where the bodies of David and Solomon were deposited, because the entrance to them was so carefully concealed. He further mentions that Herod, having been terrified by the bursting out of flames, which stopped his further progress, built a most costly marble monument at the entrance of the tomb ('Jud. Ant.,' 7. 15:3; 13. 8:4; 16. 7:1). For the sense, supply "and therefore he could not be speaking of himself." The explanation follows that he was a prophet, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:22-36 From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: and here is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.</body></html>
