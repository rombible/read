As with most other prophets, the precise time, even the "manner of time," was hidden from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He would raise up Christ.</span>--The Greek, by using the verb from which comes the word "resurrection," gives to the verb the definite sense of "raising from the dead."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="accented">- Being therefore</span> for <span class="accented">therefore being</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that of the fruit of his loins he would set one upon</span> for <span class="accented">that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Had sworn</span>, etc. The first record of God's promise to David is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>: "The Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house. And... I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and will establish his kingdom.... Thy throne shall be established forever;" and in ver. 28, David speaks of it as God's promise: "Thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant." But there is no mention there of an oath. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, great stress is laid upon God having sworn to David: "I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations" (vers. 3, 4); and again, ver. 35, "Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, should be read through carefully (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a>). (For the phrase, "I have sworn by my holiness," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:22-36 From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: and here is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.</body></html>
