"Ionia and Lydia, of which Ephesus was the capital, called Proconsular Asia" (Wordsworth and 'Speaker's Commentary.' See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-16.htm">Acts 20:16, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Egypt</span>, etc. These represent the third great dispersion, that effected by Ptolemy Lagus. Some of this part of the dispersion are mentioned as very hostile to Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>). "Two-fifths of the population of Alexandria were Jews." "Jews formed one quarter of the population of Cyrene" ('Speaker's Commentary.') See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-32.htm">Matthew 27:32</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes.</span> The copula and couples the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1fec;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, etc., of ver. 9.

Many good commentators - Alford, Meyer, Lechler (in Lange, 'Bibel Works'), etc. - take the words "Jews and proselytes" as applying to the whole preceding list, not to the Roman sojourners only; but in that case one would not expect <span class="accented">Cretans and Arabians</span> to follow. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-13 The difference in languages which arose at Babel, has much hindered the spread of knowledge and religion. The instruments whom the Lord first employed in spreading the Christian religion, could have made no progress without this gift, which proved that their authority was from God.</body></html>
