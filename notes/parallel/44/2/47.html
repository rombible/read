The Sadducean priests were, probably, the only section that looked on them with a malignant fear.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</span>--Many of the better MSS. omit the words "to the Church," and connect "together," which in the Greek is the first word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a>, with this verse--<span class= "ital">The Lord added together</span> . . . The verb "added" is in the tense which, like the adverb "daily," implies a continually recurring act. "The Lord" is probably used here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>, in its generic Old Testament sense, rather than as definitely applied to Christ. For "such as should be saved"--a meaning which the present participle passive cannot possibly have--read, <span class= "ital">those that were in the way of salvation;</span> literally, <span class= "ital">those that were being saved, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.">1Corinthians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:">2Corinthians 2:15</a>. The verse takes its place among the few passages in which the translators have, perhaps, been influenced by a Calvinistic bias; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>, "if <span class= "ital">any man</span> draw back," instead of "if <span class= "ital">he</span> draw back," being another. It should, however, be stated in fairness that all the versions from Tyndale onward, including the Rhemish, give the same rendering. Wiclif alone gives nearly the true meaning, "them that were made safe."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> <span class="accented">- To them day by day</span> for <span class="accented">to the Church daily</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">those that were being sated</span> for <span class="accented">such as should be saved</span>, A.V.

In fact, they have no sense unless you construe them with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "those who escaped to the same place," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Church.

The exhortation in ver. 40 was "Save yourselves from this crooked generation." Those who were added to the Church were those who complied with the exhortation, and escaped from complicity with their unbelieving countrymen. They were the remnant that escaped.

They kept close to holy ordinances, and abounded in piety and devotion; for Christianity, when admitted in the power of it, will dispose the soul to communion with God in all those ways wherein he has appointed us to meet him, and has promised to meet us. The greatness of the event raised them above the world, and the Holy Ghost filled them with such love, as made every one to be to another as to himself, and so made all things common, not by destroying property, but doing away selfishness, and causing charity. And God who moved them to it, knew that they were quickly to be driven from their possessions in Judea. The Lord, from day to day, inclined the hearts of more to embrace the gospel; not merely professors, but such as were actually brought into a state of acceptance with God, being made partakers of regenerating grace. Those whom God has designed for eternal salvation, shall be effectually brought to Christ, till the earth is filled with the knowledge of his glory.</body></html>
