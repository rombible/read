Minos and Rhadamanthus, and Tartarus and the Elysian Fields,--these they had learnt to dismiss, as belonging to the childhood of the individual and of mankind,--<p>"Esse aliquid Manes et subterranea regna<p>Vix pueri credunt.". . . .<p>["Talk of our souls and realms beyond the grave,<p>The very boys will laugh and say you rave."]<p>--Juvenal, <span class= "ital">Sat. ii.</span> 149.<p>The Epicurean rejected the idea of a divine government altogether. For the Stoic, to quote a line from Schiller,--<p>"Die Welt-geschichte ist das Welt-gericht,"<p>["And the world's story is its judgment day, "]<p>and he expected no other. The thought of a day of judgment as the consummation of that history, which was so prominent in St. Paul's teaching, was altogether strange to them.<p><span class= "bld">By that man whom he hath ordained.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">by a man.</span> Who the man was, and what proof there was that he had been raised from the dead, were questions either reserved for a later stage of teaching, or interrupted by the derision of the hearers. Up to this point they had listened attentively, but that the dead should be raised again seemed to them--as to the Sadducean, to the Greeks generally--absolutely incredible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-8.htm" title="Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?">Acts 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1Corinthians 15:35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> <span class="accented">- Inasmuch as</span> for <span class="accented">because</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the man</span> for <span class="accented">that man</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">He hath appointed a day</span>. Hitherto the Athenians seem to have listened with interest while St. Paul was, with consummate skill, leading them onwards from the doctrines of natural religion, and while he was laying down speculative truths. But now they are brought to a stand. They might no longer go on asking, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; A day fixed by God, they were told, was at hand, in which God would judge the world in righteousness, and in which they themselves would be judged also. And the certainty of this was made apparent by the fact that he who was ordained to be Judge was raised from the dead, and so ready to commence the judgment. The time for immediate action was come; God's revelation had reached them. <span class="cmt_word">The man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>). So <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>. And so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27</a> our Lord himself says of himself that the Father gave him authority to execute judgment "because he is the Son of man;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-24.htm">Matthew 26:24</a>, "Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power." (For the connection of the judgment with Christ's resurrection, see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-40.htm">Acts 10:40-42</a>.) So too the Creeds. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.</body></html>
