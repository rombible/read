The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, in its primary sense, means to "place any one" in a given spot; and thence secondarily, to "conduct" or" escort" any one to a place, to "set him down" at such a place. So Homer ('Odyssey,' 13:294) uses the word of transporting any one by ship to this or that town (quoted by Meyer). There is the indication in the word of St. Paul's defect of sight or infirmity. <span class="cmt_word">Receiving a commandment</span>, etc. We learn here that St. Paul sent a message to Silas and Timothy to join him at Athens as quickly as possible, and at ver. 16 that he waited at Athens for them. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2</a>, we learn that he sent Timothy from Athens back to Thessalonica; and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a> we learn that Timothy came to St. Paul at Corinth (where the Epistle to the Thessalonians was written) from Thessalonica. We also learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a> that Silas and Timothy were both with him at Corinth when he wrote the Epistle, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> that they had both come to Corinth from Macedonia, some weeks after Paul himself had been at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4, 5</a>). All these statements harmonize perfectly (as Paley has shown) on the supposition that Silas and Timothy did join St. Paul at Athens; that for the reasons given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3.htm">1 Thessalonians 3</a>, when he was unable to return to Thessalonica himself, as he much wished, he sent Timothy back to Thessalonica, and Silas probably to Beraea; and that Silas and Timothy came together from Macedonia to Corinth, where St. Paul had gone alone; where it may be noted, as another undesigned coincidence, that whereas the First Epistle to the Thessalonians implies that Silas did <span class="accented">not</span> go to Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> does not say that Silas and Timothy came from <span class="accented">Thessalonica</span>, but from <span class="accented">Macedonia.</span> The inaccuracy supposed by Meyer (on this verse) is purely imaginary. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> does not say that Silas and Timothy "only joined Paul at Corinth," but merely relates some change in St. Paul's procedure consequent upon their joining him at Corinth. Alford (on this verse), in saying that Paul sent Timothy from Beraea, not from Athens, is guided by his own idea of what is probable, not by the letter of the narrative (see further note on Acts 18:5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:10-15 The Jews in Berea applied seriously to the study of the word preached unto them. They not only heard Paul preach on the sabbath, but daily searched the Scriptures, and compared what they read with the facts related to them. The doctrine of Christ does not fear inquiry; advocates for his cause desire no more than that people will fully and fairly examine whether things are so or not. Those are truly noble, and likely to be more and more so, who make the Scriptures their rule, and consult them accordingly. May all the hearers of the gospel become like those of Berea, receiving the word with readiness of mind, and searching the Scriptures daily, whether the things preached to them are so.</body></html>
