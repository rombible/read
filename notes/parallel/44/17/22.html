If it was actually sitting at the time, the temptation to have recourse to it, if only to cause a sensation and terrify the strange disputant, may well have been irresistible. As the Apostle stood there, he looked from the slight elevation on the temple of the Eumenides below him, that of Theseus to the east, and facing him on the Acropolis, the Parthenon. On the height of that hill stood the colossal bronze statue of Athena as the tutelary goddess of her beloved Athens, below and all around him were statues and altars. The city was "very full of idols."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Areopagus</span> for <span class="accented">Mars</span> <span class="accented">hill</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in all things I perceive that</span> for <span class="accented">I perceive that in all things</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">somewhat</span> for <span class="accented">too</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst</span> is simply a local description.

There is a difference of opinion among commentators whether these words imply praise or blame. Chrysostom, followed by many others, takes it as said in the way of encomium, and understands the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, very religious, more than commonly religious. And so Bishop Jacobson ('Speaker's Commentary'), who observes that the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is used five times by Josephus, and always in the sense of "religion," or "piety." On the other hand, the Vulgate (<span class="accented">superstitiosiores</span>), the English Versions, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, etc., take the word in its most common classical sense of "superstitious;" and it weighs for something towards determining St. Luke's use of the word that Plutarch uses <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> always in a bad sense, of superstition, as in his life of Alexander and elsewhere, and in his tract 'De Superstitione' (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). Perhaps the conclusion is that St. Paul, having his spirit stirred by seeing the city full of idols, determined to attack that spirit in the Athenian people which led to so much idolatry; which he did in the speech which follows. But, acting with his usual wisdom, he used an inoffensive term at the outset of his speech. He could not mean to praise them for that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> which it was the whole object of his sermon to condemn. Josephus ('Contr.

In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.</body></html>
