Men have to think of God as the supreme Giver, not as requiring anything at their hands but justice, mercy, and truth. Both Jewish and heathen writers had borne their witness of the same truth: David had said, "Thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm" title="For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.">Psalm 51:16</a>), and the Latin Epicurean poet had written of the Divine nature, that it was--<p>"Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nihil indiga nostri,<p>Nec bene promeritis capitur, nec tangitur ira."<p>["Strong in itself, it needeth nought of ours,<p>Is neither won by gifts, nor moved by wrath."]<p><span class= "ital">Lucret.</span> ii. 649-50.<p>The passage is found also in some editions in i. 61, 62.<p><span class= "bld">Life and breath.</span>--If we can draw a distinction between the two words, the first may be held to mean the higher element of man's life, the latter that which he shares, by virtue of his organization, with other animals. Stoics and Epicureans would, probably, both of them, so far, accept a teaching which echoed much that was taught in their own schools.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- Is he served by</span> for <span class="accented">is worshipped with</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he himself</span> for <span class="accented">he</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Served by men's hands</span>. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is "waited upon," as a man is waited upon by his servant, who ministers to his wants; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> are "an attendant." So in Hebrew: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, to serve God; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, a servant of God; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> service as of the Levites in the temple, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Anything</span>; or as some take it, as if he needed anybody's help or service. The argument, as Chrysostom suggests, is similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8-12</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.</body></html>
