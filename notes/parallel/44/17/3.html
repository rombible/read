In the intervals between the Sabbaths, the Apostle worked, as usual, for his livelihood, probably, of course, as a tent-maker (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2Thessalonians 3:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That Christ must needs have suffered.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that the Christ, </span>as pointing to the expected Messiah, the Anointed of the Lord, whom all Jews were expecting, but whom they were unwilling to recognise in the crucified Jesus. The argument was, therefore, to show that prophecy pointed to a suffering as well as a glorified Messiah, and that both conditions were fulfilled in Jesus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- It behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise</span> for <span class="accented">Christ must needs have suffered, and risen</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">whom, said he</span> for <span class="accented">whom</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proclaim</span> for <span class="accented">preach.</span> A.V.; <span class="accented">the Christ</span> for <span class="accented">Christ</span>, A.V. The line of reasoning adopted by St. Paul in his preaching to the Thessalonian Jews was the same as that of our Lord to the disciples and apostles on the day of his resurrection, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26, 27</a>; 44-47, and that of St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>, etc.), and it is irresistible. The fulfillment of prophecies relating to the Messiah in the person of Jesus is like the fitting of a key to the intricate wards of the lock, which proves that it is the right key. The preacher of the gospel should carefully study and expound to the people the word of prophecy, and then show its counterpart in the sufferings and glory of Christ. This did St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Opening</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); as our Lord had done (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>), the hidden meaning of the prophecies, and then <span class="cmt_word">alleging</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), setting before them the propositions which had thus been established. The process is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a> as <span class="accented">interpreting</span> ("expounded," A.V.). In this verse the opening was showing from the prophets that the Messiah was to die and rise again; the <span class="accented">alleging</span> was that Jesus was that very Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 The drift and scope of Paul's preaching and arguing, was to prove that Jesus is the Christ. He must needs suffer for us, because he could not otherwise purchase our redemption for us; and he must needs have risen again, because he could not otherwise apply the redemption to us. We are to preach concerning Jesus that he is Christ; therefore we may hope to be saved by him, and are bound to be ruled by him. The unbelieving Jews were angry, because the apostles preached to the Gentiles, that they might be saved. How strange it is, that men should grudge others the privileges they will not themselves accept! Neither rulers nor people need be troubled at the increase of real Christians, even though turbulent spirits should make religion the pretext for evil designs. Of such let us beware, from such let us withdraw, that we may show a desire to act aright in society, while we claim our right to worship God according to our consciences.</body></html>
