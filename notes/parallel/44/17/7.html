(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm" title="And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.">Luke 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-12.htm" title="And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.">John 19:12</a>.) The preachers were not only bringing in a <span class= "ital">relligio illicita, </span>but were guilty of treason against the majesty of the empire; they said there was "another King." It is clear from the Epistle to the Thessalonians that the Kingdom of Christ, and specially His second coming as King, had been very prominent in the Apostle's teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,">2Thessalonians 1:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,">2Thessalonians 2:1-12</a>), and this may have furnished materials for the accusation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- Act</span> for <span class="accented">do</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Received</span>; i.e. as the word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> always means "received as a guest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-6.htm">Luke 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>, etc.). Hence the substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, an entertainment or reception. The insinuation is that, by harboring these seditious men, Jason had made himself a partner in their sedition. That there is another king, etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12, 15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 The drift and scope of Paul's preaching and arguing, was to prove that Jesus is the Christ. He must needs suffer for us, because he could not otherwise purchase our redemption for us; and he must needs have risen again, because he could not otherwise apply the redemption to us. We are to preach concerning Jesus that he is Christ; therefore we may hope to be saved by him, and are bound to be ruled by him. The unbelieving Jews were angry, because the apostles preached to the Gentiles, that they might be saved. How strange it is, that men should grudge others the privileges they will not themselves accept! Neither rulers nor people need be troubled at the increase of real Christians, even though turbulent spirits should make religion the pretext for evil designs. Of such let us beware, from such let us withdraw, that we may show a desire to act aright in society, while we claim our right to worship God according to our consciences.</body></html>
