Aristotle, whose <span class= "ital">Politics</span> well-nigh exhausts the list of all known official titles in Greek cities, does not mention it, although he gives an analogous title (<span class= "ital">Politophylakes</span>) as found at Larissa and elsewhere (<span class= "ital">Pol. v.</span> 6). An inscription on an arch that still spans (or did so till quite lately) one of the streets of the modern city <span class= "ital">Saloniki, </span>shows it to have been a special official title of that city, and St. Luke's use of it may, therefore, be noted as an instance of his accuracy in such matters. The inscription is probably of the date of Vespasian, but it contains some names that are identical with those of the converts in the apostolic history, Sosipater ("Sopater," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), Gaius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm" title="And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.">Acts 19:29</a>), and Secundus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>). It would seem from the inscription that, as with the Archons of Athens, there were seven magistrates who bore the title.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Dragged</span> for <span class="accented">drew</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">before</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Certain brethren</span>; some of the Thessalonian Christians who happened to be in the house of Jason. <span class="cmt_word">The rulers of the city</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and ver. 8). This is a remarkable instance of St. Luke's accuracy. The word is unknown in Greek literature. But an inscription on an ancient marble arch, still standing in Thessalonica, or Saloniki, records that Thessalonica was governed by seven politarchs (see the inscription in Conybeare and Howson, col. 1. p. 360). Thessalonica was a Greek city, governed by its own laws. Hence the mention of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 5. The polit-archs also were Greek, not Roman, magistrates. <span class="cmt_word">Crying</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, often followed by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-7.htm">Acts 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>, etc.), but whether so followed or not, always meaning "a loud cry" or "shout" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-34.htm">Acts 21:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-4.htm">Luke 3:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Turned the world upside down</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is used in the New Testament only by St. Luke and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-38.htm">Acts 21:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-12.htm">Galatians 5:12</a>); to <span class="accented">unsettle</span> or <span class="accented">disturb</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to make people literally <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> homeless, outcasts, from their former settlements, or, metaphorically, unsettled in their allegiance to their civil or spiritual rulers, is the meaning of the word. In the mouth of St. Paul's accusers it contains a distinct charge of sedition and disobedience to the Roman law. <span class="accented">The world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> the Roman empire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>), viewed as coextensive with the habitable globe (see ver. 31; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-20.htm">Acts 19:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 The drift and scope of Paul's preaching and arguing, was to prove that Jesus is the Christ. He must needs suffer for us, because he could not otherwise purchase our redemption for us; and he must needs have risen again, because he could not otherwise apply the redemption to us. We are to preach concerning Jesus that he is Christ; therefore we may hope to be saved by him, and are bound to be ruled by him. The unbelieving Jews were angry, because the apostles preached to the Gentiles, that they might be saved. How strange it is, that men should grudge others the privileges they will not themselves accept! Neither rulers nor people need be troubled at the increase of real Christians, even though turbulent spirits should make religion the pretext for evil designs. Of such let us beware, from such let us withdraw, that we may show a desire to act aright in society, while we claim our right to worship God according to our consciences.</body></html>
