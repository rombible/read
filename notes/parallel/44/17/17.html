The third mode of action, disputing in the market-place, the <span class= "ital">agora, </span>which in every Greek city was the centre of its life, was a new experiment. He saw, we may believe, others so disputing; teachers of this or that school of philosophy, with listeners round them, debating glibly of the "highest good," and the "chief end" of life, and man's relation to the One and the All. Why should not he take part in the discussion, and lead those who were apparently in earnest in their inquiries to the truth which they were vainly seeking?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - So <span class="accented">he reasoned</span> for <span class="accented">therefore disputed he</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and the devout</span> for <span class="accented">and with the devout</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">market-place every day</span> for <span class="accented">market daily</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Reasoned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, as in ver. 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-19.htm">Acts 18:19</a> and Acts 24:12).

It was wholly given to idolatry. The zealous advocate for the cause of Christ will be ready to plead for it in all companies, as occasion offers. Most of these learned men took no notice of Paul; but some, whose principles were the most directly contrary to Christianity, made remarks upon him. The apostle ever dwelt upon two points, which are indeed the principal doctrines of Christianity, Christ and a future state; Christ our way, and heaven our end. They looked on this as very different from the knowledge for many ages taught and professed at Athens; they desire to know more of it, but only because it was new and strange. They led him to the place where judges sat who inquired into such matters. They asked about Paul's doctrine, not because it was good, but because it was new. Great talkers are always busy-bodies. They spend their time in nothing else, and a very uncomfortable account they have to give of their time who thus spend it. Time is precious, and we are concerned to employ it well, because eternity depends upon it, but much is wasted in unprofitable conversation.</body></html>
