At a still earlier stage of its history, as in Chaucer and the Vision of Piers Plowman,<p>["How thou lernest the people,<p>The lered and the lewed, "] i. 2100.<p>it meant simply the layman, or untaught person, as distinct from the scholar. The "baser sort" answers to a Greek word describing the loungers in the <span class= "ital">agora, </span>or market-place, ever ready for the excitement of a tumult--the <span class= "ital">sub-rostrani</span> or <span class= "ital">turba forensis</span> of Latin writers.

The name was locally conspicuous as having belonged to the old hero of the Argonautic expedition, and to the tyrant of Pherae. It is probable, however, that St. Paul would, in the first instance, take up his abode with a Jew, and that Jason, as in the case of the apostate high priest of <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-7.htm" title="But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest,">2 Maccabees 4:7</a>, was the Greek equivalent for Joshua or Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">To bring them out to the people.</span>--Thessalonica was a free Greek city, and the Jews accordingly in the first instance intended to bring the matter before the popular <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> or assembly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Jews</span> for <span class="accented">Jews which believed not</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">being moved</span> for <span class="accented">moved</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">jealousy</span> for <span class="accented">envy</span>, A.V.

If, as is very probable, the Jason here mentioned is the same person as the Jason of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>, it would seem that he joined the apostle, either at this time or on his visit to Macedonia mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>, and went with him to Corinth, where the Epistle to the Romans was written. He was a relation, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, of St. Paul's, and doubtless a Jew. <span class="accented">Jason</span> was a Romanized form of the name <span class="accented">Jesus</span>, or <span class="accented">Joshua, as</span> we see in the case of the high priest, the brother of Chins (Josephus, ' Ant. Jud.,' 12. 5:1). It was borne also by Jason of Cyrene, the Jewish historian (2 Macc. 2:23), and by another mentioned in 1 Macc. 7. 1:17, etc. St. Luke seems to introduce Jason as a well-known person. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 The drift and scope of Paul's preaching and arguing, was to prove that Jesus is the Christ. He must needs suffer for us, because he could not otherwise purchase our redemption for us; and he must needs have risen again, because he could not otherwise apply the redemption to us. We are to preach concerning Jesus that he is Christ; therefore we may hope to be saved by him, and are bound to be ruled by him. The unbelieving Jews were angry, because the apostles preached to the Gentiles, that they might be saved. How strange it is, that men should grudge others the privileges they will not themselves accept! Neither rulers nor people need be troubled at the increase of real Christians, even though turbulent spirits should make religion the pretext for evil designs. Of such let us beware, from such let us withdraw, that we may show a desire to act aright in society, while we claim our right to worship God according to our consciences.</body></html>
