If we are God's offspring our conception of Him should mount upward from what is highest in ourselves, from our moral and spiritual nature, instead of passing downward to that which, being the creature of our hands, is below us. Substantially asserting the same truth, the tone of St. Paul in speaking of idolatry is very different from that which we find in the older prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm" title="And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleeps, and must be awaked.">1Kings 18:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/135-15.htm" title="The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.">Psalm 135:15-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). He has, as it were, studied the <span class= "ital">genesis</span> of idolatry, and instead of the burning language of scorn, and hatred, and derision, can speak of it, though not with tolerance, yet with pity, to those who are its victims.<p><span class= "bld">The Godhead.</span>--The Greek term is neuter, and corresponds to the half-abstract, half-concrete forms of the "Divine Being," the "Deity."<p><span class= "bld">Gold, or silver, or stone.</span>--The first word reminds us of the lavish use of gold in the colossal statue of Zeus by Phidias. Silver was less commonly used, but the shrines of Artemis at Ephesus (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm" title="For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;">Acts 19:24</a>) supply an instance of it. "Stone" was the term commonly applied to the marble of Pentelicus, which was so lavishly employed in the sculpture and architecture of Athens.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="accented">Being</span> <span class="accented">then</span> for <span class="accented">forasmuch then as we are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">device of man</span> for <span class="accented">man's device</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Graven by art</span>, etc. In the Greek the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, graven images, things engraven, is in apposition with the gold, silver, and stone, and a further description of them.

Compare the withering sarcasm of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.</body></html>
