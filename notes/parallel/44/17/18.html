The former took its name from its founder, Epicurus, who lived a long and tranquil life at Athens, from B.C. 342 to 270. As holding their meetings in a garden, which he had left b<span class= "ital">y</span> his will in trust as a place of study for his disciples, they were sometimes known as the School of the Garden, and as such were distinguished from those of the Porch (Diog. Laert. <span class= "ital">Epic.</span> c. 10). His speculations embraced at once a physical and an ethical solution of the problems of the universe. Rejecting, as all thinking men did, the popular Polytheism, which yet they did not dare openly to renounce, he taught that the gods, in their eternal tranquillity, were too far off from man to trouble themselves about his sorrows or his sins. They needed no sacrifices and answered no prayers. The superstition which enslaved the minds of most men was the great evil of the world, the source of its crimes and miseries. The last enemy to be destroyed was with him, as in our own time with Strauss, the belief in an immortality of retribution. A man's first step towards happiness and wisdom was to emancipate himself from its thraldom; the next was to recognise that happiness consisted in the greatest aggregate of pleasurable emotions. Experience taught that what are called pleasures are often more than counterbalanced by the pains that follow, and sensual excesses were therefore to be avoided. Epicurus's own life seems to have been distinguished by generosity, self-control, and general kindliness, and even by piety and patriotism (Diog. Laert. <span class= "ital">Epic.</span> c. 5). But as no law was recognised as written in the heart, and human laws were looked on as mere conventional arrangements, each man was left to form his own estimate of what would give him most pleasure, and most men decided for a life of ease and self-indulgence; sometimes balanced by prudential calculations, sometimes sinking into mere voluptuousness. The poetry of Horace presents, perhaps, the most attractive phase of popular Epicureanism; the sense which has come to be attached to the modern word "Epicure," as applied to one whose life is devoted to the indulgence of the sense of taste, shows to what a depth of degradation it might sink.<p>In the world of physics, Epicurus has been claimed as anticipating some of the results of modern science. The ideas of creation and control were alike excluded. Matter had existed from eternity, and the infinite atoms of which it was composed had, under the action of attractive and Tepelling forces as yet unknown, entered into manifold combinations, out of which had issued, as the last stage of the evolution, the world of nature as it now lies before us. The poem of Lucretius, <span class= "ital">De Rerum Natura, </span>may be regarded as the grandest utterance of this negative and practically atheistic system, but its real nobleness lies chiefly in its indignant protest against the superstition which had cast its veil of thick darkness over all the nations.<p>It may be well to give one or two characteristic examples of each of these phases. On the one side we have the ever-recurring advice of the popular poet of society to remember that life is short, and to make the most of it:--<p>"Quid sit futurum cras, fuge quaerere: et,<p>Quern Fors dierum cunque dabit, lucro<p>Appone."<p>["Strive not the morrow's chance to know,<p>But count whate'er the Fates bestow<p>As given thee for thy gain."]--Hor. <span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 9.<p>"Sapias, vina liques, et spatio brevi<p>Spem longam reseces. Dum loquimur, fugerit invida<p><span class= "ital">'tas.</span> Carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero."<p>["Be wise, and let your wines flow clear,<p>And as you greet each short-lived year,<p>Curb hope's delusive play:<p>E'en as we speak, our life glides by;<p>Enjoy the moments as they fly,<p>Nor trust the far-off day."]--Od. i. 11.<p>The student of Scripture will recognise an Epicurean element of this kind in one of the two voices that alternate in the Book of Ecclesiastes, "It is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm" title="Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him: for it is his portion.">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm" title="For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm" title="Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm" title="Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God now accepts your works.">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>). It appears as the avowed principle of the evil-doers in the Apocryphal Book of Wisdom which, as probably the work of a contemporary writer, represents the impression made by the dominant Horatian phase of Epicureanism on a devout and thoughtful Jew:--<p>"Our time is a very shadow that passeth away . . . Come on, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present . . . Let us crown ourselves with rose-buds before they are withered . . . Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness."--<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-5.htm" title="For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again.">Wisdom Of Solomon 2:5-9</a>.<p>There is a nobler ring, it must be owned, in the bold language in which Lucretius sings the praises of Epicurus:--<p>"When this our life lay crushed before men's eyes<p>Beneath the yoke of Faith, who from on high<p>With horrid aspect frightened mortal hearts,<p>It was a Greek, himself a mortal too,<p>Who first had courage to lift up his eyes<p>And to her face withstand her. Tales of gods,<p>And thunderbolts from Heaven, with all their threats,<p>Were impotent to stay him. . . .<p>. . . . So at last<p>Faith in its turn lies trampled under foot,<p>And we through him have triumphed over Heaven."<p><span class= "ital">De Rer. Nat.</span> i. 67-80.<p>We can understand how St. Paul would assert, as against this school of thought, the personality of the living God, as Creator, Ruler, Father; the binding force of the law written in the heart; intuitive morality as against mere utilitarianism; the nobleness of a hero-soul raised above pleasure, and living, not for itself, but for others and for God. And in so teaching them he, in this respect differing from the mere professor of a higher philosophy, would point to the Resurrection and the Judgment as that which should confound the pleasure-seeker by giving him tribulation and anguish, and should assign glory and immortality to the patient worker of righteousness. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7-9</a>.)<p>The Stoics--who took their name, not from their founder (Zeno, of Citium in Cyprus), but from the <span class= "ital">Stoa paekile, </span>the painted porch, at Athens, adorned with frescoes of the battle of Marathon, where Zeno used to teach--presented a higher phase of thought. Josephus (<span class= "ital">Vit. c.</span> 2) compares them with the Pharisees, and their relation to the moral life of heathenism at this time presented many features analogous to those which we find in the influence of that sect in Palestine. They taught that true wisdom consisted in being the master, and not the slave, of circumstances. The things which are not in our power are not things to seek after, nor shrink from, but to be accepted with a calm equanimity. The seeker after wisdom learnt, therefore, to be indifferent alike to pleasure or pain, and aimed at an absolute apathy. The theology of the Stoics was also of a nobler kind than that of Epicurus. They spoke of a divine Mind pervading the universe, and ordering all things by its Providence. They recognised its government in the lives of nations and individual men, and probably reconciled, as the Pharisees did, their acceptance of its decrees with a practical belief in the freedom of the individual will. In the <span class= "ital">Manual of Ethics, </span>by Epictetus, under Nero, and the <span class= "ital">Meditations</span> of Marcus Aurelius, we see how the slave and the emperor stood on common ground. In Seneca, we see now often the Stoics spoke in the accents of Christian ethics. Many of the Stoics were sought after as tutors for the sons of noble families, and occupied a position of influence not unlike that of Jesuit confessors and directors in France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The main drawbacks were (1) that in aiming at apathy for themselves they shut out sympathy with others as disturbing their tranquillity; (2) that in striving after an ethical perfection in the strength of their own will they anticipated the position of the Pelagians in the history of the Christian Church; and (3) that, as with the Pharisees, the high ideal was often but a mask for selfish and corrupt lives. They, also, were too often "hypocrites," acting a part before the world to which their true character did not correspond. In the language of the satirist--<p>"Qui Curios simulant et Bacchanalia vivunt."<p>["They pose as heroes, and as drunkards live."]<p>--Juvenal, <span class= "ital">Sat.</span> ii. 3.<p>It is evident that there would be many points of sympathy between the better representatives of this school and St. Paul, but for them also the message that spoke of Jesus and the Resurrection--of God sending His Son into the world to be first crucified and then raised from the dead--would seem an idle dream, and they would shrink from the thought that they needed pardon and redemption, and could do nothing true and good in their own strength without the grace of God.<p><span class= "bld">What will this babbler say?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">What might this babbler mean?</span> The Greek noun, literally <span class= "ital">seed-picker, </span>was primarily applied to a small bird of the finch tribe. The idle gossips of the <span class= "ital">agora</span> picking up news, and, eager to retail it, the chattering parasites of feasts, were likened by the quick wit of Athenian humourists to such a bird as it hopped and chirped. So Zeno himself called one of his disciples, who had more words than wisdom, by the same contemptuous name (Diog. Laert. <span class= "ital">Zeno, </span>c. 19). The philosophers, in their scorn of the stranger who was so ready to discuss great questions with any whom he met, applied the derisive epithet to him.<p><span class= "bld">He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods.</span>--This was, it will be remembered, the precise charge on which Socrates had been condemned (Xenoph. <span class= "ital">Memor.</span> i. 1, ? 1). In his case it rested on his constant reference to the <span class= "ital">daemon, </span>the divine monitor who checked and guided him, in whose voice he heard something like the voice of God; but the secret of his condemnation by his countrymen was to be found less in what he actually taught than in the questions with which he vexed their inmost soul, and made them conscious of ignorance or baseness. The questions of St. Paul, as he reasoned "of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come," were equally disturbing.<p><span class= "bld">Because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</span>--The verb implies continuous action. This was the ever-recurring theme of his discourses. It is possible that with the strong tendency of the Greek mind to personify all attributes and abstract thoughts, St. Paul's hearers saw in the word <span class= "ital">Anastasis </span>(= Resurrection) the name of a new goddess, representing the idea of immortality, to be worshipped in conjunction with Jesus, and therefore they used the plural and spoke of his bringing in "strange gods." So temples and altars had been dedicated to Concord, and the history of Athens told how Epimenides had bidden them erect two altars to Insolence and Outrage (Cicero, <span class= "ital">De Leg.</span> ii. 11), as the two demons by whom their city was being brought to ruin. What startled them in the Apostle was that he taught not only the immortality of the soul--that had entered into the popular mythical belief, and had been enforced with philosophical arguments by Socrates and Plato--but the resurrection of the body. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1Corinthians 15:35</a> we see the character of the objections raised to this doctrine, and the manner in which St. Paul answered them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="accented">- And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers</span> for <span class="accented">then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">would</span> for <span class="accented">will</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">preached</span> for <span class="accented">preached unto them</span>, A.V. and T.R.

It may, however, not less properly be taken in the sense of a hostile encounter of words, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-31.htm">Luke 14:31</a>, and frequently in classical Greek. <span class="cmt_word">This babbler</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a picker-up of seeds</span>, applied to a crow (Aristoph., 'Ayes,' 232, 579).

Hence it is used of idle hangers-on in the markets, who get a livelihood by what they can pick up, and so generally of empty, worthless fellows.

A</span> setter forth of strange gods. There does not seem to be the least ground for Chrysostom's suggestion that they took <span class="accented">Anastasis</span> (the Resurrection) for the name of a goddess. But the preaching of Jesus the Son of God, himself risen from the dead (ver. 31), and hereafter to be the Judge of quick and dead at the general resurrection, was naturally, to both Stoics and Epicureans, <span class="cmt_word">a setting forth of strange gods</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> are "foreign deities," or "daemons," inferior gods. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, a setter forth, does not occur elsewhere. But the nearly identical word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used by Plutarch. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:16-21 Athens was then famed for polite learning, philosophy, and the fine arts; but none are more childish and superstitious, more impious, or more credulous, than some persons, deemed eminent for learning and ability. It was wholly given to idolatry. The zealous advocate for the cause of Christ will be ready to plead for it in all companies, as occasion offers. Most of these learned men took no notice of Paul; but some, whose principles were the most directly contrary to Christianity, made remarks upon him. The apostle ever dwelt upon two points, which are indeed the principal doctrines of Christianity, Christ and a future state; Christ our way, and heaven our end. They looked on this as very different from the knowledge for many ages taught and professed at Athens; they desire to know more of it, but only because it was new and strange. They led him to the place where judges sat who inquired into such matters. They asked about Paul's doctrine, not because it was good, but because it was new. Great talkers are always busy-bodies. They spend their time in nothing else, and a very uncomfortable account they have to give of their time who thus spend it. Time is precious, and we are concerned to employ it well, because eternity depends upon it, but much is wasted in unprofitable conversation.</body></html>
