The first points to our animal life; the second--from which is derived the Greek word used by ethical writers for passions, such as fear, love, hate, and the like--not, as the English verb suggests, to man's power of bodily motion in space, but to our emotional nature; the third, to that which constitutes our true essential being, the intellect and will of man. What the words express is not merely the Omnipresence of the Deity; they tell us that the power for every act and sensation and thought comes from Him. They set forth what we may venture to call the true element of Pantheism, the sense of a "presence interposed," as in nature, "in the light of setting suns," so yet more in man. As a Latin poet had sung, whose works may have been known to the speaker, the hearers, and the historian:--<p>"Deum namque ire per omnes<p>Terras que tractusque maris, ccelumque profundum,<p>Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,<p>Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas,<p>Scilicet hinc reddi deinde ac resoluta referri,<p>Omnia; nec morti esse locum sed viva volare<p>Sideris in numerum atque alto succedere caelo."<p>["God permeates all lands, all tracts of sea,<p>And the vast heaven. From Him all flocks and herds,<p>And men, and creatures wild, draw, each apart,<p>Their subtle life. To Him they all return,<p>When once again set free. No place is found<p>For death, but all mount up once more on high<p>To join the stars in their high firmament."]<p>--Virg. <span class= "ital">Georg.</span> iv. 221-225.<p>In the teaching of St. Paul, however, the personality of God is not merged, as in that of the Pantheist, in the thought of the great Soul of the World, but stands forth with awful distinctness in the character of King and Judge. Traces of like thoughts are found in the prophetic vision of a time when God shall be "all in all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1Corinthians 15:28</a>), the discords of the world's history harmonised in the eternal peace.<p><span class= "bld">As certain also of your own poets have said.</span>--The quotation has a special interest as being taken from a poet who was a countryman of St. Paul's. Aratus, probably of Tarsus (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> B.C. 272), had written a didactic poem under the title of <span class= "ital">Phenomena, </span>comprising the main facts of astronomical and meteorological science as then known. It opens with an invocation to Zeus, which contains the words that St. Paul quotes. Like words are found in a hymn to Zeus by Cleanthes (B.C. 300). Both passages are worth quoting:--<p>(1)"From Zeus begin; never let us leave<p>His name unloved. With Him, with Zeus, are filled<p>All paths we tread, and all the marts of men;<p>Filled, too, the sea, and every creek and bay;<p>And all in all things need we help of Zeus,<p><span class= "ital">For we too are his offspring."</span><p>--Aratus, <span class= "ital">Phaenom.</span> 1?5.<p>(2)"Most glorious of immortals, many-named,<p>Almighty and for ever, thee, O Zeus,<p>Sovran o'er Nature, guiding with thy hand<p>All things that are, we greet with praises. Thee<p>'Tis meet that mortals call with one accord,<p><span class= "ital">For we thine offspring are, </span>and we alone<p>Of all that live and move upon this earth,<p>Receive the gift of imitative speech."<p>--Cleanthes, <span class= "ital">Hymn to Zeus.</span><p>The fact of the quotation would at once quicken the attention of the hearers. They would feel that they had not to deal with an illiterate Jew, like the traders and exorcists who were so common in Greek cities, but with a man of culture like their own, acquainted with the thoughts of some at least of their great poets.<p><span class= "bld">We are also his offspring.</span>--We too often think of the quotation only as happily introduced at the time; but the fact that it was quoted shows that it had impressed itself, it may be, long years before, on St. Paul's memory. As a student at Tarsus it had, we may well believe, helped to teach him the meaning of the words of his own Scriptures: "I have nourished and brought up children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>). The method of St. Paul's teaching is one from which modern preachers might well learn a lesson. He does not begin by telling men that they have thought too highly of themselves, that they are vile worms, creatures of the dust, children of the devil. The fault which he finds in them is that they have taken too low an estimate of their position. They too had forgotten that they were God's offspring, and had counted themselves, even as the unbelieving Jews had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a>) "unworthy of eternal life."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - Even for <span class="accented">also</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For in him,</span> etc. This is the proof that we have not far to go to find God, Our very life and being, every movement we make as living persons, is a proof that God is near, nay, more than near, that he is with us and round about us, quickening us with his own life, upholding us by his own power, sustaining the being that we derive from him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>, etc.; Psalms 23:4). <span class="cmt_word">Certain even of your own poets</span>; viz. Arstus of Tarsus (), who has the exact words quoted by St. Paul, and Cleanthes of Asses (), who has <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>. As he had just defended himself from the imputation of introducing foreign gods by referring to an Athenian altar, so now, for the same purpose, he quotes one of their own Greek poets. (For the statement that man is the offspring of God, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-38.htm">Luke 3:38</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.</body></html>
