Many of the better MSS., however, give "as far as the sea," and this is probably the meaning even of the reading followed by the Authorised version. The absence of any mention of places between Ber?a and Athens, (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Amphipolis and Apollonia are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-1.htm" title="Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:">Acts 17:1</a>), is presumptive evidence that St. Paul actually travelled by sea, and rounding the promontory of Sunium, entered Athens by the Piraeus. He had been accompanied so far by some of those who had escorted him from Beraea, but when they too went back, he was, we must remember, for the first time since the commencement of his missionary labours, absolutely alone. His yearning for companionship and counsel is shown in the urgent message sent to Silas and Timotheus to come "with all speed" (literally, <span class= "ital">as quickly as possible</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> As far as we can gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;">1Thessalonians 3:1-3</a>, Timotheus came by himself to Athens, probably after the scene at the Areopagus, and was sent back at once with words of counsel and comfort to those whom he reported as suffering much tribulation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- Forth</span> for <span class="accented">away</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as far as</span> for <span class="accented">as it were</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>), A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">As far as to the sea</span>. If the reading of the T.R. is right, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> merely indicates the direction. Literally, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>, means "with the thought of going to the sea," but thence, by a common usage, it describes the action without reference to the thought. The English phrase, "they made for the sea," is nearly equivalent. The object of going to the sea, seventeen miles from Beraea, was to take ship for Athens. This he probably did either at Pydna or at Dium. <span class="cmt_word">Silas and Timothy</span>. Whether Timothy left Philippi with St. Paul, or whether, as is not improbable, he joined him at Thessalonica, cannot be decided. Anyhow, Paul now left Silas and Timothy to watch over the Thessalonian converts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:10-15 The Jews in Berea applied seriously to the study of the word preached unto them. They not only heard Paul preach on the sabbath, but daily searched the Scriptures, and compared what they read with the facts related to them. The doctrine of Christ does not fear inquiry; advocates for his cause desire no more than that people will fully and fairly examine whether things are so or not. Those are truly noble, and likely to be more and more so, who make the Scriptures their rule, and consult them accordingly. May all the hearers of the gospel become like those of Berea, receiving the word with readiness of mind, and searching the Scriptures daily, whether the things preached to them are so.</body></html>
