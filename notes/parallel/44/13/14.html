It lay on the slopes of Mount Taurus, which the travelers must have crossed, had obtained the "Jus Italicum"--a modified form of Roman citizenship--under Augustus, and had attracted, as the sequel shows, a considerable Jewish population, who had made many proselytes among the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-42.htm" title="And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles sought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.">Acts 13:42</a>).

They sat as in the seat of the Rabbi, and their doing so was an indication, as the sequel shows, that they asked for permission to address the congregation. It will be remembered that the organisation of the synagogue excluded the sacerdotal element altogether, and that lay-preaching, assuming a sufficient training, was an established practice. It need hardly be said that neither elders nor scribes were necessarily of the tribe of Levi.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- They, passing through from Perga, came</span> for <span class="accented">when they departed from Perga they came</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of</span> for <span class="accented">in</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they went</span> for <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V.

It would be a difficult and dangerous road, infested with robbers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-26.htm">2 Corinthians 11:26</a>), mountainous, rugged, and passing through an untamed and half-savage population. Pisidia was part of the province of Galatia. The direction of their route was probably determined by the locality of the Jewish populations, which were always their first object, and their door of access to the more pious heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Sat down</span>; perhaps, as many think, on the seat of the rabbis - those "chief seats in the synagogues," which our Lord rebukes the scribes for loving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-39.htm">Mark 12:39</a>), but which "Paul as a former Sanhe-drist, and Barnabas as a Levite," had a fair claim to occupy; but more probably on the seats of ordinary worshippers, where, however, the presence of strangers would at once be noticed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:14-31 When we come together to worship God, we must do it, not only by prayer and praise, but by the reading and hearing of the word of God. The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.</body></html>
