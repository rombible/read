It agreed with the then current language of mankind that death was as a sleep. It differed from it in thinking of that sleep not as "eternal" (the frequently recurring epithet in Greek and Roman epitaphs), but as the prelude to an awakening.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> <span class="accented">- In his own generation served the counsel of God</span> for <span class="accented">served his own generation by the will of God</span>, A.V. Many good commentators construe the words as the R.T. does, only some, instead of <span class="cmt_word">in his own generation</span>, render "for," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the good of, "his own generation." But the A.V. is the most natural division of the sentence, and gives the best sense, only the punctuation should connect the words "by the will of God" with "fell on sleep." There is an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2.htm">1 Kings 2</a>:l, 10, and it is intimated that God was still caring for David in his death. But there was this vast difference between David and Christ. David had a work to do limited to his own generation, and when that work was done he died and saw corruption. But Christ had a work to carry on for eternal generations, and so he rose and saw no corruption. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:32-37 The resurrection of Christ was the great proof of his being the Son of God. It was not possible he should be held by death, because he was the Son of God, and therefore had life in himself, which he could not lay down but with a design to take it again. The sure mercies of David are that everlasting life, of which the resurrection was a sure pledge; and the blessings of redemption in Christ are a certain earnest, even in this world. David was a great blessing to the age wherein he lived. We were not born for ourselves, but there are those living around us, to whom we must study to be serviceable. Yet here is the difference; Christ was to serve all generations. May we look to Him who is declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead, that by faith in him we may walk with God, and serve our generation according to his will; and when death comes, may we fall asleep in him, with a joyful hope of a blessed resurrection.</body></html>
