The former were offered, as the fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham, the high privilege of being the channel through which "all families of the earth should be blessed" by the knowledge of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm" title="And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.">Genesis 22:18</a>). When they rejected that offer, it was made, without their intervention, to the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">Judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life.</span>--There is a touch of righteous indignation, perhaps something like irony, in the words. The preacher had thought them "worthy" of the highest of all blessings, the life eternal which was in Christ Jesus, but they, in their boastful and envious pride, took what was really a lower estimate of themselves, and showed that they were "unworthy." They passed sentence, <span class= "ital">ipso facto, </span>on themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</span>--We have to remember (1) that the words were as an echo of those which the Apostle had heard in his trance in the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a>); (2) that they would be heard, on the one hand, by the Gentiles with a joy hitherto unknown, and, on the other, by the Jews as a new cause of irritation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">spake out boldly</span> for <span class="accented">waxed bold</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">be</span> for <span class="accented">have been</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">seeing</span> for <span class="accented">but seeing</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">thrust</span> for <span class="accented">put</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">eternal</span> for <span class="accented">everlasting</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Spake out boldly</span>. Observe that Barnabas as well as Paul resented the unseemly opposition of the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">It was necessary</span>. The necessity arose from the command of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-26.htm">Acts 3:26</a>). It is in accordance with this purpose of God that St. Paul says of the gospel that "it is the power of God unto salvation... to the Jew first, and also to the Greek" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). Compare, too, our Lord's saying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>) and the woman's reply (ibid. 27). In point of fact, this had been the practice of Paul and Barnabas no less than of Peter, and was the very motive that had brought them to Antioch. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, we turn to the Gentiles</span>. These were, indeed, bold words to speak in a Jewish synagogue; the speakers had doubtless sought courage from the Holy Ghost (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:42-52 The Jews opposed the doctrine the apostles preached; and when they could find no objection, they blasphemed Christ and his gospel. Commonly those who begin with contradicting, end with blaspheming. But when adversaries of Christ's cause are daring, its advocates should be the bolder. And while many judge themselves unworthy of eternal life, others, who appear less likely, desire to hear more of the glad tidings of salvation. This is according to what was foretold in the Old Testament. What light, what power, what a treasure does this gospel bring with it! How excellent are its truths, its precepts, its promises! Those came to Christ whom the Father drew, and to whom the Spirit made the gospel call effectual, Ro 8:30. As many as were disposed to eternal life, as many as had concern about their eternal state, and aimed to make sure of eternal life, believed in Christ, in whom God has treasured up that life, and who is the only Way to it; and it was the grace of God that wrought it in them. It is good to see honourable women devout; the less they have to do in the world, the more they should do for their own souls, and the souls of others: but it is sad, when, under colour of devotion to God, they try to show hatred to Christ. And the more we relish the comforts and encouragements we meet with in the power of godliness, and the fuller our hearts are of them, the better prepared we are to face difficulties in the profession of godliness.</body></html>
