The absence of any record of evangelising work there is probably due to the fact that there were no synagogues, and that the Apostles in this mission adhered to the plan of preaching in the first instance to the Jews, and making the synagogue, as it were, their base of operations.<p><span class= "bld">John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</span>--We are left to conjecture the motives of this departure. He may have shrunk from the perils and hardships of the journey into the interior of the country. He may have been drawn by affection for his mother, who lived at Jerusalem. It is clear, in any case, from St. Paul's subsequent conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>), that he looked on the reason as insufficient, while Barnabas saw, at least, enough to admit the plea of extenuating circumstances. The pressure of the famine at Jerusalem may have seemed to him to excuse the desire of the son to minister to the mother's wants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Vow for <span class="accented">now</span> when, A.V.; <span class="accented">set sail</span> for <span class="accented">loosed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and came</span> for <span class="accented">they</span> came, A.V.; <span class="accented">departed.., and returned</span> for <span class="accented">departing</span>... <span class="accented">returned</span>, A.V. A very marked change may here be observed in the relations of Barnabas and Paul. Hitherto Barnabas has always occupied the first rank. It has been "Barnabas and Saul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>; vers. 2, 7). But now the whole mission, including Barnabas, is described as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Paul and his company</span>, and ever after it is usually "Paul and Barnabas" (vers. 43, 46, 50; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2, 22, 35</a>); though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a> and Acts 15:12, 25, the old order is retained. Renan dwells much on the beauty of Barnabas's character as seen in his cheerful acquiescence in this change of relative position, and his single-minded devotion to the success of the work. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Perga</span>, the capital of Pamphylia, in that part of the coast of Asia Minor which looks due south. Perga was about seven and a half miles inland, on the river Cestrus, which is navigable. There was a constant intercourse between Paphos the capital of Cyprus, and Perga the capital of Pamphylia, fostered probably by the two famous temples of Venus and Diana. The word for set sail (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is a nautical term, meaning sailing from the shore or harbor into the open sea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-11.htm">Acts 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-1.htm">Acts 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22</a>). At Perga John Mark left them. Perhaps his position as Barnabas's cousin was less pleasant now that Paul took the first place; perhaps his courage failed him now that they were fairly launched out into the heathen world, where, unlike Cyprus, his Jewish kinsmen were a small minority, and the dangers and fatigues were great. Pamphylia was now governed by a propraetor, being an imperial province. Its name denotes that it was inhabited by a mixed race - men of all tribes, aborigines, Cilicians, Greeks, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:4-13 Satan is in a special manner busy with great men and men in power, to keep them from being religious, for their example will influence many. Saul is here for the first time called Paul, and never after Saul. Saul was his name as he was a Hebrew; Paul was his name as he was a citizen of Rome. Under the direct influence of the Holy Ghost, he gave Elymas his true character, but not in passion. A fulness of deceit and mischief together, make a man indeed a child of the devil. And those who are enemies to the doctrine of Jesus, are enemies to all righteousness; for in it all righteousness is fulfilled. The ways of the Lord Jesus are the only right ways to heaven and happiness. There are many who not only wander from these ways themselves, but set others against these ways. They commonly are so hardened, that they will not cease to do evil. The proconsul was astonished at the force of the doctrine upon his own heart and conscience, and at the power of God by which it was confirmed. The doctrine of Christ astonishes; and the more we know of it, the more reason we shall see to wonder at it. Those who put their hand to the plough and look back, are not fit for the kingdom of God. Those who are not prepared to face opposition, and to endure hardship, are not fitted for the work of the ministry.</body></html>
