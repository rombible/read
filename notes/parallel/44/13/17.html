It was a theme which Israelites were never tired of listening to. It showed that the Apostles recognised it as the history of God's chosen people.<p><span class= "bld">And exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in their sojourning in the land of Egypt.</span> The word for "exalt" is found in the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>, where our version has, "I have nourished and <span class= "ital">brought up</span> children," and may fairly be considered as an echo from the lesson that had just been read. It may be noted that it was only in this sense, as increasing rapidly in population, that Israel could be spoken of as "exalted" in the house of bondage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Israel</span> for <span class="accented">of Israel</span>, A.V., <span class="accented">sojourned</span> for <span class="accented">dwelt as strangers</span>, A.V.; a for <span class="accented">an</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">led he them forth</span> for <span class="accented">brought he them out</span>, A.V. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, exalted, is thought by some to be borrowed from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x5de;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), I have brought up" (A.V.), but this is very doubtful, as <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is frequently used in the New Testament in the sense of exalting from a low to a high estate (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-15.htm">Luke 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>; see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-52.htm">Genesis 41:52</a> (LXX., Cod. Vat.) and Gen 48:19). The resemblance of this exordium to that of Stephen's speech in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>. must strike every one. The natural conclusion is that that speech made a deep impression upon St. Paul when he heard it at Stephen's trial. The common purpose in the two speeches is to conciliate and gain the attention of the Jewish hearers by dwelling upon the great events of the history of their fathers, of which they were proud, and claiming for Christians an equal heritage in that history. The speeches diverge in that Stephen sought to show in that history instances of the same stubborn unbelief in their fathers which had led the children to crucify the Lord of glory; but St. Paul rather sought to show how the promises made to their fathers had their fulfillment in that Jesus whom he preached unto them, and how the crucifixion of Christ by the Jerusalem Jews was an exact fulfillment of the Law and the prophets which had just been read to them in the synagogue. In both speeches it is a great point to exhibit Christianity as the true development of Judaism (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a> and throughout). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:14-31 When we come together to worship God, we must do it, not only by prayer and praise, but by the reading and hearing of the word of God. The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.</body></html>
