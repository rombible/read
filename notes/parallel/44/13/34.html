To those, however, whose minds were full to overflowing with the writings of the prophets they would be pregnant with meaning. What were the "sure mercies of David" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm" title="Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.">Isaiah 55:3</a>) but the "everlasting covenant" of mercy which was to find its fulfilment in One who should be "a leader and commander to the people?" We may well believe that the few words quoted recalled to St. Paul and to his hearers the whole of that wonderful chapter which opens with "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters." The Greek word for "mercies" is the same adjective as that translated "holy" in the next verse, "holiness" being identified with "mercy," and so forms a connecting link with the prophecy cited in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- Hath spoken</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">holy and sure blessings</span> for <span class="accented">sure mercies</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>No more to return to corruption</span>. This is added to show that Christ's resurrection was a final victory over death; not like that of Lazarus, or the Shunammite's son, or Jairus's daughter, but, as St. Paul himself says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him." Here he tells us that this eternal exemption of Christ from death was promised or signified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>, which he quotes from the LXX., only abbreviating the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., into <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, I will give. What, then, is meant by the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f76;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>? The Hebrew has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, which can mean nothing else but "the sure mercies of David," the favor and mercy promised to David in God's everlasting covenant, well ordered in all things and sure. And in like manner, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f76;&#x3b4;</span> means "the mercies of God to David." And if we turn to the account of this covenanted mercy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, we shall see that it comprises the setting of David's seed upon his throne for ever (see specially vers. 12-16). In ver. 15 it is said, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "My mercy shall not depart from him." And in the next verse his house and his kingdom are described as being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, sure," or "established for ever," which, when applied to the personal Christ, the Son of David, manifestly implies his eternal exemption from death and corruption (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>). The sense of the Hebrew, therefore, is clever and certain, and it is equally certain that the LXX. meant to represent this sense in the version here quoted by St. Paul. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, though properly meaning "holy, pious," and thence "mild" and "merciful" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, Hesych.) as applied to man, came to be applied in the same senses to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>; and here and in the LXX.). Beyond doubt, therefore, the passage before us is rightly rendered in the A.V., "the sure mercies of David;" the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, represents the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of the Hebrew. Clemens Alex. (quoted by Schleusner) uses it in the same way for "mercies or "benefits:" <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: "<span class="accented">For</span> how many mercies are we indebted to Christ!" In a similar way, the Latin <span class="accented">pietas</span> is used for God's "justice" or "kindness" ('AEneid,' 2:536; 5:688). "Trini pulses pietatem" (on a sepulchral monument, A.D. 1427): "Beat at the door of God's mercy." Gronovius, in his note on 'AEian. V. H.,' 8:1, where he ascribes to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> the primitive sense of what is "just" and "due," from man either to God or to his fellowman, adds, "Tribuunt quidem LXX? interpetiam Deo <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: sod etiam tum significat quoddam quasi <span class="accented">offcium</span> benignitatia in heroines pios, Deo decorum." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:32-37 The resurrection of Christ was the great proof of his being the Son of God. It was not possible he should be held by death, because he was the Son of God, and therefore had life in himself, which he could not lay down but with a design to take it again. The sure mercies of David are that everlasting life, of which the resurrection was a sure pledge; and the blessings of redemption in Christ are a certain earnest, even in this world. David was a great blessing to the age wherein he lived. We were not born for ourselves, but there are those living around us, to whom we must study to be serviceable. Yet here is the difference; Christ was to serve all generations. May we look to Him who is declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead, that by faith in him we may walk with God, and serve our generation according to his will; and when death comes, may we fall asleep in him, with a joyful hope of a blessed resurrection.</body></html>
