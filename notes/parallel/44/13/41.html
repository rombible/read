So, in the next clause, "wonder, and perish" takes the place of "wonder marvellously." The fact that St. Paul quotes from the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm" title="Behold you among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which you will not believe, though it be told you.">Habakkuk 1:5</a>) whose teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm" title="Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.">Habakkuk 2:4</a>) that "the just by faith shall live" becomes henceforth the axiom of his life, is not without a special interest. The "work" of which the prophet spoke was defined in the following verse as the raising up the Chaldeans, "that bitter and hasty nation," to execute God's judgment. St. Paul may have had in his thoughts the like judgment about to be executed by the Romans, and already known as foretold by Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-2.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, See you not all these things? truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.">Matthew 24:2-28</a>), or may have thus dimly indicated that which was so closely connected with it--the rejection of Israel, because they, as a nation, had rejected Christ. The sharp tone of warning, as in St. Stephen's speech (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>), suggests the thought that signs of anger and impatience had already begun to show themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> <span class="accented">- If one</span> for <span class="accented">though a man</span>, A.V. "Though" best expresses the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;</span> of the Hebrew. The passage is quoted nearly verbatim from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>. The difference from the Hebrew arises from the LXX. having read in their copy <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, proud, arrogant men (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;</span>), for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, among the heathen, as is clear from their rendering the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a> and Habakkuk 2:5, by the same word (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>). The rendering <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, and perish, for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (another form of the preceding verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which in the A.V. is construed with it, and the two together rendered "wonder marvelously"), is not so easily explained. The two best explanations seem to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the LXX. read <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> instead of the present order of the words, and so rendered the first word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, wonder, and, taking the next word from another root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, rendered it <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, perish; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, reading the words in the same order in which they now stand in the Hebrew text, they rendered the first <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">or</span>, with the intensive addition, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, and took the second in the sense it has in Arabic, "to be altered" or "changed for the worse," and expressed it by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, meaning" change countenance from fear and astonishment." And in favor of this explanation the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16</a> ("they disfigure their faces") is quoted (see Rosenm&uuml;ller on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>). St. Paul took the LXX. as he found it. Perhaps he saw signs in some of that unbelief and perverse opposition which afterwards broke out (ver. 45), and so was led to close his sermon with words of awful warning. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:38-41 Let all that hear the gospel of Christ, know these two things: 1. That through this Man, who died and rose again, is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins. Your sins, though many and great, may be forgiven, and they may be so without any injury to God's honour. 2. It is by Christ only that those who believe in him, and none else, are justified from all things; from all the guilt and stain of sin, from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses. The great concern of convinced sinners is, to be justified, to be acquitted from all their guilt, and accepted as righteous in God's sight, for if any is left charged upon the sinner, he is undone. By Jesus Christ we obtain a complete justification; for by him a complete atonement was made for sin. We are justified, not only by him as our Judge but by him as the Lord our Righteousness. What the law could not do for us, in that it was weak, the gospel of Christ does. This is the most needful blessing, bringing in every other. The threatenings are warnings; what we are told will come upon impenitent sinners, is designed to awaken us to beware lest it come upon us. It ruins many, that they despise religion. Those that will not wonder and be saved, shall wonder and perish.</body></html>
