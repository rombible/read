It will be remembered that it was applied, under Elizabeth and James, to the governor, known in more recent times as the Viceroy, or Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and was therefore a very close approximation to the meaning of the Latin. The provinces of the Roman empire, under the organisation of Augustus, were divided (B.C. 27) into two classes. Those that were looked on as needing direct military control were placed under the emperor as commander of the legions, and were governed by propraetors, or generals; the others were left to the Senate, and were under the rule of proconsuls. Strabo (xiv. <span class= "ital">ad fin.</span>) describes Cyprus as a military or propraetorian province, and this has led some to question St. Luke's accuracy. It appears, however, that Augustus, in A.D. 22, re-assigned it to the Senate (Dio. Cass. iv. p. 523). Coins of Cyprus are extant, bearing the date of Claudius, and the name of Cominius Proclus as proconsul (Akerman, <span class= "ital">Numismatic Illustrations, </span>pp. 39-42), and as stated above (Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-4.htm" title="So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.">Acts 13:4</a>), one has recently been discovered in Cyprus itself, in which that title appears as borne by one of the name of Paulus. Under Hadrian, it appears to have been under a propraetor; under Severus, it was again under a proconsul. Of the proconsul himself we know nothing certain more than is recorded here. The name probably implied a connection with the old 'milian <span class= "ital">gens, </span>among whom, as in the case of the great conqueror of Macedonia, it was a favourite cognomen. Dr. Lightfoot has, however, pointed out that Pliny, writing <span class= "ital">circ.</span> A.D. 90, names a Sergius Paulus as his chief authority for the facts in Books 2 and 18 of his <span class= "ital">Natural History, </span>and that among these are two specially connected with Cyprus; and that Galen, writing <span class= "ital">circ.</span> A.D. 150, speaks of one bearing the same name, also a proconsul, as a contemporary of his own, and as distinguished for his love of wisdom. Here, of course, identity is out of the question, but relationship is, at least, probable.<p><span class= "bld">A prudent man.</span>--The adjective describes what we should call general intelligence and discernment, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.">Matthew 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm" title="In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in your sight.">Luke 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.">1Corinthians 1:19</a>. It was shown in this instance in his at once recognising the higher type of character presented by the Apostles, and desiring to know more of the "word" which they spake to him as a message from God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- The proconsul</span> for <span class="accented">the deputy of</span> the <span class="accented">country</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of understanding</span> for <span class="accented">a prudent man</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the same</span> for <span class="accented">who</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto him</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sought</span> for <span class="accented">desired</span>, A.V. The proconsul (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); here and vers. 8, 12. This is an instance of Luke's great accuracy. Cyprus had become a proconsular province in the reign of Claudius, having previously been one of the emperor's provinces governed by a propraetor, or legatus. A man of understanding (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is a rare word in the New Testament, and is always translated in the A.V. "prudent" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>). It is common in the LXX., where it represents the Hebrew words <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, all signifying "intelligence," "skill," "knowledge," and the like. The substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> has the same scope (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-47.htm">Luke 2:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>, etc.); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, therefore, means something more than "<span class="accented">a</span> prudent man." It means a man of knowledge and superior intelligence and understanding. And such was Sergius Paulus, a noble Roman, who is twice named by Pliny in the list of authors placed at the commencement of his work as the authorities from whom he derived the matter contained in the several books. It is not a little remarkable that the two books, lib. it. and lib. 18, for which Sergius Paulus is quoted are just those which contain accounts of the heavenly bodies, and prognostications from the sun and moon and stars, from thunder, from the clouds, and such like things, which doubtless formed the staple of Elymas's science; so that there can be little doubt that Sergius Paulus had Elymas with him, that he might learn from him such matters as might be useful for the hook which he was writing. There is also a curious passage in lib. 30. cap. 1. of the 'Hist. Nat.'(quoted by Lewin, vol. 1. p. 128), in which Pliny, after enumerating the most famous teachers of magic, Zoroaster, Orthanes, Pythagoras, and others, adds, "There is also another school of magic which springs from Moses and Jannes, who were Jews, but many thousand years later than Zoroaster; so much more recent is the school of Cyprus;" showing that he knew of a school of magic art at Cyprus taught by Jews, and leading us to infer that he had acquired this knowledge either from the pen or the mouth of Sergius Paulus. Anyhow, a remarkable confirmation of St. Luke's narrative. Another Sergius Paulus, who might be a son or grandson of the proconsul, is highly commended by Galen for his eminent philosophical attainments (Lewin, vol. 1. p. 127). One L. Sergius Paulus was consul suffectus in A.D. , another in A.D. . Renan thinks they may have been descendants of the Sergius Paulus in the text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:4-13 Satan is in a special manner busy with great men and men in power, to keep them from being religious, for their example will influence many. Saul is here for the first time called Paul, and never after Saul. Saul was his name as he was a Hebrew; Paul was his name as he was a citizen of Rome. Under the direct influence of the Holy Ghost, he gave Elymas his true character, but not in passion. A fulness of deceit and mischief together, make a man indeed a child of the devil. And those who are enemies to the doctrine of Jesus, are enemies to all righteousness; for in it all righteousness is fulfilled. The ways of the Lord Jesus are the only right ways to heaven and happiness. There are many who not only wander from these ways themselves, but set others against these ways. They commonly are so hardened, that they will not cease to do evil. The proconsul was astonished at the force of the doctrine upon his own heart and conscience, and at the power of God by which it was confirmed. The doctrine of Christ astonishes; and the more we know of it, the more reason we shall see to wonder at it. Those who put their hand to the plough and look back, are not fit for the kingdom of God. Those who are not prepared to face opposition, and to endure hardship, are not fitted for the work of the ministry.</body></html>
