Its primary meaning expresses simply "ease in working;" but this passed through the several stages of "versatility," "shiftiness," and "trickery." A kindred word is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14</a> as "lewdness."<p><span class= "bld">Thou child of the devil.</span>--There is, perhaps, an intentional contrast between the meaning of the name <span class= "ital">Bar-jesus</span> (= son of the Lord who saves) and the character of the man, which led him to oppose righteousness in every form, and to turn "the <span class= "ital">straight</span> paths of God's making" into the crooked ones of man's subtlety. There is a manifest reference to the words in which Isaiah describes the true preparation of the way of the Lord as consisting in making the crooked straight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-4.htm" title="Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:">Isaiah 40:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- All guile and all villainy</span> for <span class="accented">all subtlety and all mischief</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">son</span> for <span class="accented">child</span>, A.V.

The kindred form (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fb3;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-14.htm">Acts 18:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Thou son of the devil</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-38.htm">John 8:38, 44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>). Elymas showed himself a child of the devil in his endeavors to resist the truth of the gospel, and substitute his own falsehoods and imposture. Compare the severity of Peter's language in rebuking Simon Magas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20-23</a>). Probably, too, he <span class="accented">accused</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) Paul and Barnabas, and <span class="accented">traduced</span> their motives before the proconsul, when he saw his own influence being undermined, and his gains likely to be stopped. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:4-13 Satan is in a special manner busy with great men and men in power, to keep them from being religious, for their example will influence many. Saul is here for the first time called Paul, and never after Saul. Saul was his name as he was a Hebrew; Paul was his name as he was a citizen of Rome. Under the direct influence of the Holy Ghost, he gave Elymas his true character, but not in passion. A fulness of deceit and mischief together, make a man indeed a child of the devil. And those who are enemies to the doctrine of Jesus, are enemies to all righteousness; for in it all righteousness is fulfilled. The ways of the Lord Jesus are the only right ways to heaven and happiness. There are many who not only wander from these ways themselves, but set others against these ways. They commonly are so hardened, that they will not cease to do evil. The proconsul was astonished at the force of the doctrine upon his own heart and conscience, and at the power of God by which it was confirmed. The doctrine of Christ astonishes; and the more we know of it, the more reason we shall see to wonder at it. Those who put their hand to the plough and look back, are not fit for the kingdom of God. Those who are not prepared to face opposition, and to endure hardship, are not fitted for the work of the ministry.</body></html>
