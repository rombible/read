(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.">1Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt be blind, not</span> <span class= "bld">seeing the sun for a season.</span>--The form of the punishment may have been, in part, determined by the Apostle's choice as manifested in prayer. If so, it suggests the thought that he had looked back on his own blindness, the exclusion of the outward light, as being that which had been to him the process by which he was led to the Sun of Righteousness and the Light that lighteth every man, and hoped that it might be so now. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-8.htm" title="And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.">Acts 9:8-9</a>.) In any case, there was a moral fitness in blindness as the penalty of the sin the very essence of which was that the man was fighting against light. That the blindness was to be "for a season" only implies that it was designed to be remedial and not simply retributive.<p><span class= "bld">There fell on him a mist and a darkness . . .</span>--Here, as in the "scales" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-13.htm" title="Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:">Acts 9:13</a>, we seem to trace something of the precision of the trained physician. The first effect of the loss of the power to see was, as in the case of St. Paul, that Elymas, who had selfishly used his knowledge to guide others to his own advantage, now had to seek for others to guide his own steps. The tense of the Greek verb (<span class= "ital">he was seeking</span>) seems to imply that he sought and did not find. He had no friends to help him, and was left to his fate unpitied.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is upon thee</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">against thee</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-21.htm">Matthew 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-55.htm">Matthew 26:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-17.htm">Luke 11:17</a>; and ver. 50 of this chapter). <span class="cmt_word">For a season</span>. It has been well observed that this limitation in time is an indication that there was place for repentance. It was a remedial chastisement. A mist (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament; but it is a medical term, very common in Hippocrates, to express a darkening and dimming of the eyes by cataract or other disease. As regards the reason why the particular punishment of blindness was inflicted upon Elymas, it might be to put a forcible interruption upon those observations of the stars and clouds by which the magician pretended to foresee the future. It would exhibit, too, to Sergius, Paulus the utter helplessness of the great necromancer. <span class="cmt_word">Some to lead him by the hand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">, as</span> Saul had needed <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> when he was struck blind by the vision of the Savior's glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:4-13 Satan is in a special manner busy with great men and men in power, to keep them from being religious, for their example will influence many. Saul is here for the first time called Paul, and never after Saul. Saul was his name as he was a Hebrew; Paul was his name as he was a citizen of Rome. Under the direct influence of the Holy Ghost, he gave Elymas his true character, but not in passion. A fulness of deceit and mischief together, make a man indeed a child of the devil. And those who are enemies to the doctrine of Jesus, are enemies to all righteousness; for in it all righteousness is fulfilled. The ways of the Lord Jesus are the only right ways to heaven and happiness. There are many who not only wander from these ways themselves, but set others against these ways. They commonly are so hardened, that they will not cease to do evil. The proconsul was astonished at the force of the doctrine upon his own heart and conscience, and at the power of God by which it was confirmed. The doctrine of Christ astonishes; and the more we know of it, the more reason we shall see to wonder at it. Those who put their hand to the plough and look back, are not fit for the kingdom of God. Those who are not prepared to face opposition, and to endure hardship, are not fitted for the work of the ministry.</body></html>
