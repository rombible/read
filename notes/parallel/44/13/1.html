The former implies a more direct message from God, coming from the Holy Ghost; the latter a more systematic instruction, in which reason and reflection bore their part.<p><span class= "bld">Simeon that was called Niger.</span>--The name seems to indicate the swarth-complexion of Africa; but nothing more is known of him. The epithet was given to him, probably, to distinguish him from the many others of the same name, possibly, in particular, from Simon of Cyrene. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Lucius of Cyrene.</span>--Probably one of the company of "men of Cyprus and Cyrene" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>) who had been among the first evangelists of Antioch. On the ground that Cyrene was famous for its School of Medicine, some writers have identified him with the author of the Acts, but the two names Lucius and Lucas are radically distinct, the latter being contracted for Lucanus.<p><span class= "bld">Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the foster-brother of Herod.</span> Here we enter on a name that has historical associations of some interest. In the early youth of Herod the Great, his future greatness had been foretold by an Essene prophet of the name of Menahem or Manaen (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 10, ? 5). When the prediction was fulfilled, he sought to show honour to the prophet. The identity of name makes it probable that the man who now meets us was the son, or grandson, of the Essene, and that Herod had had him brought up with Antipas as a mark of his favour. Both Antipas and Archelaus were educated at Rome, and Manaen may therefore have accompanied them thither. By what steps he was led to believe in Jesus as the Christ, we can only conjecture; but it seems probable that the austere type of life, so closely resembling that of the Essenes, which was presented by the Baptist, may have impressed him, as he was living in the court of his early companion, and that, through him, he may have been led on to the higher truth, and, in due time, after the Day of Pentecost, have become a sharer in the prophetic gift. The fact that Herod the Great had adorned the city of Antioch with a long and stately colonnade may, perhaps, have given him a certain degree of influence there.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul.</span>--The position of Saul's name at the end of the list seems to indicate that it was copied from one which had been made before he had become the most prominent of the whole company of the prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- At Antioch., in the Church that was there</span> for <span class="accented">in the Church that was at Antioch</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">prophets</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">certain prophets</span>, etc., A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Barnabas</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">as Barnabas</span>, etc., A.V.; <span class="accented">Symeon</span> for <span class="accented">Simeon</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the foster-brother of</span> for <span class="accented">which had been brought up with</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">At Antioch, in the Church</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> rather means "the existing Church," just as at <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "the existing powers," "the powers that be," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="accented">The then Church</span> seems mere the meaning than <span class="accented">the Church there.</span> Luke writes from the standpoint of many years later. Prophets were a regular part of the ministry of the then Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 14:1, 3, etc., 1 Corinthians 14:22, 24, 31, 32: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>. See also note on Acts 4:26). Teachers (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are coupled with <span class="accented">prophets, as</span> here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>. The <span class="accented">teachers</span> would appear to differ from the prophets in that they were not under the ecstatic influence of the Holy Spirit, and did not utter exhortations or prophecies in a poetic strain, but were expounders of Christian truth, under the teaching of the Spirit. What they spoke was called a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>), and their function was <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is reckoned among the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, the gifts of the Holy Ghost. It was forbidden to women to <span class="accented">teach</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-12.htm">1 Timothy 2:12</a>), though they might prophesy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>). It is thought by Meyer, Alford, and others that the position of the particles <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> attaching the two following names to Barnabas in the first place, and one name following to Manaen in the second, indicates that Barnabas, Symeon, and Lucius were prophets, and Manaen and Saul teachers. Lucius has by some been falsely identified with St. Luke. The foster-brother; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may equally mean a foster-brother, one nursed at the same time at the same breast, which would indicate that Manaen's mother was wet-nurse to Herod the tetrarch; or a playmate, which would indicate that he had been <span class="accented">sodalis</span> to Herod. It is only found here in the New Testament, but is used by Xenophon, Plutarch, etc., and in 1 Macc. 1:7; 2 Macc. 9:29. In this chapter and onwards the scene of the great drama of Christianity is transferred from Jerusalem to Antioch. The first part, which has hitherto been played by Peter and John and James, is now taken up by Barnabas and Saul, soon, however, to be classed as Paul and Barnabas. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-3 What an assemblage was here! In these names we see that the Lord raises up instruments for his work, from various places and stations in life; and zeal for his glory induces men to give up flattering connexions and prospects to promote his cause. It is by the Spirit of Christ that his ministers are made both able and willing for his service, and taken from other cares that would hinder in it. Christ's ministers are to be employed in Christ's work, and, under the Spirit's guidance, to act for the glory of God the Father. They are separated to take pains, and not to take state. A blessing upon Barnabas and Saul in their present undertaking was sought for, and that they might be filled with the Holy Ghost in their work. Whatever means are used, or rules observed, the Holy Ghost alone can fit ministers for their important work, and call them to it.</body></html>
