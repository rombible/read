They "compassed sea and land to make one proselyte" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-15.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.">Matthew 23:15</a>). They found it easier to make proselytes of women. Such conversions had their good and their bad sides. In many cases there was a real longing for a higher and purer life than was found in the infinite debasement of Greek and Roman society, which found its satisfaction in the life and faith of Israel. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-12.htm" title="Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.">Acts 17:12</a>.) But with many, such as Juvenal speaks of when he describes (<span class= "ital">Sat. vi.</span> 542) the Jewish teacher who gains influence over women--<p>"Arcanam Judaea tremens mendicat in aurem<p>Interpres legum Solymarum"--<p>["The trembling Jewess whispers in her ear,<p>And tells her of the laws of Solymse,"]<span class= "note">[3][3] Solymae, of course, stands for Jerusalem.</span><p>the change brought with it new elements of superstition and weakness, and absolute submission of conscience to its new directors, and thus the Rabbis were often to the wealthier women of Greek and Roman cities what Jesuit confessors were in France and Italy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Here we get the darker side of the picture. The Jews stir up the women of the upper class, and they stir up their husbands. The latter were content apparently to acquiesce in their wives accepting the Judaism with which they had become familiar, but resented the intrusion of a new and, in one sense, more exacting doctrine.<p><span class= "bld">Raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas.</span>--It lies in the nature of the case that they were not the only sufferers. From the first the Christians of Antioch in Pisidia had to learn the lesson that they must "through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm" title="Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.">Acts 14:22</a>). The memory of these sufferings came back upon St. Paul's mind, even in the last months of his life, as something never to be forgotten (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-11.htm" title="Persecutions, afflictions, which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.">2Timothy 3:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> <span class="accented">- Urged on</span> for <span class="accented">stirred up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the devout women of honorable estate</span> for <span class="accented">the devout and honorable women</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">stirred up a</span> for <span class="accented">raised</span>, A.V.; cast <span class="accented">them out of their borders</span> for <span class="accented">expelled them out of their coasts</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Urged on</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>).

Commonly those who begin with contradicting, end with blaspheming. But when adversaries of Christ's cause are daring, its advocates should be the bolder. And while many judge themselves unworthy of eternal life, others, who appear less likely, desire to hear more of the glad tidings of salvation. This is according to what was foretold in the Old Testament. What light, what power, what a treasure does this gospel bring with it! How excellent are its truths, its precepts, its promises! Those came to Christ whom the Father drew, and to whom the Spirit made the gospel call effectual, Ro 8:30. As many as were disposed to eternal life, as many as had concern about their eternal state, and aimed to make sure of eternal life, believed in Christ, in whom God has treasured up that life, and who is the only Way to it; and it was the grace of God that wrought it in them. It is good to see honourable women devout; the less they have to do in the world, the more they should do for their own souls, and the souls of others: but it is sad, when, under colour of devotion to God, they try to show hatred to Christ. And the more we relish the comforts and encouragements we meet with in the power of godliness, and the fuller our hearts are of them, the better prepared we are to face difficulties in the profession of godliness.</body></html>
