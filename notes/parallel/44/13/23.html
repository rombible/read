No Jew could have gone up to keep a feast at Jerusalem for some years past without having heard something of the one or of the other. St. Paul's tone is clearly that of one who assumes that their story is already vaguely known, and who comes to offer knowledge of greater clearness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- Promise</span> for <span class="accented">his promise</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">brought</span> for <span class="accented">raised</span>, A.V. and T.R. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-15.htm">Isaiah 48:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>). This verse leads to the great announcement which Paul had to make of the next great step in God's dealings with Israel, for which the pro- ceding ones of the redemption from Egyptian bondage, and the kingdom of David, were preparatory, viz. the actual coming of the Son of David, the Messiah, to save his people Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:14-31 When we come together to worship God, we must do it, not only by prayer and praise, but by the reading and hearing of the word of God. The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.</body></html>
