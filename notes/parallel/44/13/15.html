These, probably, came into use soon after the return from Babylon. To these were afterwards added special lessons, known technically as the <span class= "ital">Haphtaroth, </span>from the prophets. We are enabled, by two curious coincidences, to fix, with very little uncertainty, the precise Sabbath on which the mission-work at Antioch opened. The opening words of St. Paul refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a> (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-18.htm" title="And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.">Acts 13:18</a>) and this was the lesson for the forty-fourth Sabbath in the year, which fell in July or August; the corresponding second lesson from the prophets being <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-1.htm" title="The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.">Isaiah 1:1-27</a>, from which he also quotes. He starts, as was natural, from what the people had just been listening to, as the text of his discourse.<p><span class= "bld">The rulers of the synagogue sent unto them . . .</span>--The elders apparently saw strangers taking the position of teachers, probably in the garb of Rabbis, and it belonged to their office to offer such persons an opportunity of addressing the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="accented">- Brethren</span> for <span class="accented">ye men and brethren</span>, A.V. The order of the synagogue service was first the prayers, read by the <span class="accented">Sheliach</span>, or angel of the synagogue, the people standing. Then came the reading of the Law in Hebrew by the reader, and the interpretation by the interpreter, who, outside of Judaea, generally used the version of the LXX. This reading, or lesson, was called the <span class="accented">Parashah.</span> Next came the reading and interpreting of the prophets, called the <span class="accented">Haphtorah</span>, either by the regular reader or by any one invited by the ruler of the synagogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16, 17</a>). Then came the <span class="accented">Midrash</span>, the exposition or sermon, which Paul undertook at the invitation of the ruler of the synagogue. Our Lord at Nazareth seems to have delivered the <span class="accented">Midrash</span> sitting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-20.htm">Luke 4:20</a>); here St. Paul stands (ver. 16). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:14-31 When we come together to worship God, we must do it, not only by prayer and praise, but by the reading and hearing of the word of God. The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.</body></html>
