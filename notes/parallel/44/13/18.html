Many of the better MSS. versions and early writers give the latter reading, and it obviously falls in far better with the conciliatory drift of St. Paul's teaching than one which implied reproach. The word is found in the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a> ("bare thee, as a man <span class= "ital">doth bear</span> his son"), where also some MSS. give the other word, and suggests the inference, already mentioned, that this chapter, as well as Isaiah 1, had been read as one of the lessons for the day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">For</span> <span class="accented">about</span> for <span class="accented">about</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Suffered he their manners</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>).

But in the Cod. Alex. of the LXX. it is the rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> he bare or carried, as a nursing father carries his child, which is the read of the Cod. Vat. and of the margin of the R.T. here. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is capable of either sense. From this quotation from Deuteronomy it is conjectured that the <span class="accented">Par-ashah</span> on this occasion was from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>, and if the <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 17 is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1</a>, that would seem to have been the <span class="accented">Haphtorah</span>, and it is curious that <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1</a>. are read in the synagogues now on the same sabbath (but see note on ver. 17). Forty years is invariably the time assigned to the dwelling in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-13.htm">Numbers 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-38.htm">Numbers 33:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-3.htm">Deuteronomy 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-10.htm">Psalm 95:10</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:14-31 When we come together to worship God, we must do it, not only by prayer and praise, but by the reading and hearing of the word of God. The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.</body></html>
