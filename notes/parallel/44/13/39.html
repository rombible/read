It is interesting to note in this, the first recorded example of St. Paul's teaching, the occurrence of the word which, as time passed on, came to be almost identified with him and with his work. It is clearly used, as interpreted by the "forgiveness of sins" in the context, in its forensic sense, as meaning "acquitted," "declared not guilty." (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">From which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</span>--The words are full of meaning, as the germ of all that was most characteristic in St. Paul's later teaching. The Law, with its high standard of righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>), its demand of entire obedience, its sacrifices which bore witness to the burden of sin, yet had no power to liberate conscience from its thraldom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1-3</a>), had taught him that its function in the spiritual life of man was to work out the knowledge of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a>), not to emancipate men from it. The sense of freedom from guilt, and therefore of a true life, was to be found, as he had learnt by his own experience, through faith in Christ. "The just by faith shall live" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm" title="Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.">Habakkuk 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> <span class="accented">- Every one that believeth is</span> for <span class="accented">all that believe are</span>, A.V. Here, then, is the great gospel message of grace, "the gospel of the grace of God," as St. Paul speaks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>; the proclamation, consequent upon the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, of a free and full forgiveness of sins to all that repent and believe the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14</a>, etc., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-77.htm">Luke 1:77</a>. Note, too, how adroitly the apostle points out the superiority of the gospel which he was preaching to them over the Law, and the pre-eminence of Christ over Moses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:38-41 Let all that hear the gospel of Christ, know these two things: 1. That through this Man, who died and rose again, is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins. Your sins, though many and great, may be forgiven, and they may be so without any injury to God's honour. 2. It is by Christ only that those who believe in him, and none else, are justified from all things; from all the guilt and stain of sin, from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses. The great concern of convinced sinners is, to be justified, to be acquitted from all their guilt, and accepted as righteous in God's sight, for if any is left charged upon the sinner, he is undone. By Jesus Christ we obtain a complete justification; for by him a complete atonement was made for sin. We are justified, not only by him as our Judge but by him as the Lord our Righteousness. What the law could not do for us, in that it was weak, the gospel of Christ does. This is the most needful blessing, bringing in every other. The threatenings are warnings; what we are told will come upon impenitent sinners, is designed to awaken us to beware lest it come upon us. It ruins many, that they despise religion. Those that will not wonder and be saved, shall wonder and perish.</body></html>
