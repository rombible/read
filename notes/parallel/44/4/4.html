As in the narrative of the feeding of the five thousand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-21.htm" title="And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.">Matthew 14:21</a>), women and children were not included. The number was probably ascertained, as on that occasion, by grouping those who came to baptism and to the breaking of bread by hundreds and by fifties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-40.htm" title="And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.">Mark 6:40</a>). The connection in which the number is given makes it probable that it represents those who, under the influence of the impression made by the healing of the cripple and by St. Peter's speech, attended the meetings of the Church that evening. The coincidence of the numbers in the two narratives could scarcely fail to lead the disciples to connect the one with the other, and to feel, as they broke the bread and blessed it, that they were also giving men the true bread from heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">howbeit</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">came to be</span> for <span class="accented">was</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The number of the men</span>; strictly, of the <span class="accented">males</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-14.htm">Acts 5:14</a>), but probably used here more loosely of men and women. It is not clear whether the five thousand is exclusive of or includes the three thousand converts at the Feast of Pentecost; but the grammar rather favors, the former, as there is nothing in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, itself to signify "disciples," or "believers," and therefore it is more naturally referred to those of whom it had just been predicated that, having heard the Word, they believed it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-4 The apostles preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. It includes all the happiness of the future state; this they preached through Jesus Christ, to be had through him only. Miserable is their case, to whom the glory of Christ's kingdom is a grief; for since the glory of that kingdom is everlasting, their grief will be everlasting also. The harmless and useful servants of Christ, like the apostles, have often been troubled for their work of faith and labour of love, when wicked men have escaped. And to this day instances are not wanting, in which reading the Scriptures, social prayer, and religious conversation meet with frowns and checks. But if we obey the precepts of Christ, he will support us.</body></html>
