(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/21-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?">Matthew 21:42-44</a>.) Then they had thought, in their blindness, that they could defy the warning. They, by their calling, the builders of the Church of Israel, did reject the stone which God had chosen to be the chief corner-stone--the stone on which the two walls of Jew and Gentile met and were bonded together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>). Here again the Epistles of St. Peter reproduce one of the dominant thoughts of his speeches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1Peter 2:6-8</a>), and give it a wider application. Thirty years after he thus spoke, Christ was still to him as "the head of the corner."<p><span class= "bld">Set at nought.</span>--St. Peter does not quote the Psalm, but alludes to it with a free variation of language. The word for "set at nought" is characteristic of St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-9.htm" title="And he spoke this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:">Luke 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>) and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-3.htm" title="Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him which eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him.">Romans 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm" title="But why do you judge your brother? or why do you set at nothing your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.">Romans 14:10</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- He</span> for <span class="accented">this</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the builders</span> for <span class="accented">builders</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was made</span> for <span class="accented">is become</span>, A.V. He is the stone. He had just appealed to their own senses; he now adds the witness of their own prophets. These had declared that the stone which was set at naught by the builders should become the chief corner-stone; just as it had come to pass. The quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>; only St. Luke here substitutes the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, to set at naught, for that used by the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> refuse, or reject as unfit.

These rulers must either be saved by that Jesus whom they had crucified, or they must perish for ever. The name of Jesus is given to men of every age and nation, as that whereby alone believers are saved from the wrath to come. But when covetousness, pride, or any corrupt passion, rules within, men shut their eyes, and close their hearts, in enmity against the light; considering all as ignorant and unlearned, who desire to know nothing in comparison with Christ crucified. And the followers of Christ should act so that all who converse with them, may take knowledge that they have been with Jesus. That makes them holy, heavenly, spiritual, and cheerful, and raises them above this world.</body></html>
