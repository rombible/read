That "boldness of speech" had been characteristic of his Lord's teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-32.htm" title="And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.">Mark 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-13.htm" title="However, no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.">John 7:13</a>). It was now to be the distinctive feature of that of the disciples: here of Peter; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-31.htm" title="Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.">Acts 28:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:">2Corinthians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-4.htm" title="Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.">2Corinthians 7:4</a>, of St. Paul; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1John 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:">1John 5:14</a>, of the beloved disciple. It is, perhaps, characteristic that the last named uses it not of boldness of speech towards men, but of confidence in approaching God. The Greek word for "when they saw" implies "considering" as well as beholding; that for "perceived" would be better expressed by <span class= "ital">having learnt, </span>or <span class= "ital">having ascertained.</span> The Greek verb implies, not direct perception, but the grasp with which the mind lays hold of a fact after inquiry. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-5.htm" title="Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.">Acts 25:5</a>, it is rightly translated "when I found."<p><span class= "bld">Unlearned and ignorant.</span>--The first of the two words means, literally, <span class= "ital">unlettered.</span> Looking to the special meaning of the "letters" or "Scriptures" of the Jews, from which the scribes took their name (<span class= "ital">grammateis, </span>from <span class= "ital">grammata</span>), it would convey, as used here the sense of "not having been educated as a scribe, not having studied the Law and other sacred writings." It does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The second word means literally, <span class= "ital">a private person, </span>one without special office or calling, or the culture which they imply: what in English might be called a "common man." It appears again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm" title="Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?">1Corinthians 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23-24</a>, with the same meaning. Its later history is curious enough to be worth noting. The Vulgate, instead of translating the Greek word, reproduced it, with scarcely an alteration, as <span class= "ital">idiota.</span> It thus passed into modem European languages with the idea of ignorance and incapacity closely attached to it, and so acquired its later sense of "idiot."<p><span class= "bld">They took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">they began to recognise.</span> The tense is in the imperfect, implying that one after another of the rulers began to remember the persons of the two Apostles as they had seen them with their Master in the Temple. These two, and these two alone, may have been seen by many of the Council on that early dawn of the day of the Crucifixion in the court-yard of the high priest's palace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm" title="And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.">John 18:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Beheld</span> for <span class="accented">saw</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">had perceived</span> for <span class="accented">perceived</span>, A.V.

St. Peter had shown his free-spokenness in so boldly proclaiming the resurrection and mighty power of him whom the rulers he was addressing had crucified. Boldness of speech, when combined with charity and moderation, is a most important grace for a minister of Christ. Unlearned and ignorant men. The term <span class="accented">unlearned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) means that they had no "knowledge of Jewish culture" beyond the Scriptures. <span class="accented">Ignorant</span> men (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) was a technical term for those who had not studied in rabbinic schools. The word <span class="accented">hediot</span> occurs frequently in the Talmud (Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 106). <span class="cmt_word">They took knowledge</span>, etc. Annas and Caiaphas or some of their people, it is likely, had seen them in the high priest's palace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15-18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:5-14 Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost, would have all to understand, that the miracle had been wrought by the name, or power, of Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, whom they had crucified; and this confirmed their testimony to his resurrection from the dead, which proved him to be the Messiah. These rulers must either be saved by that Jesus whom they had crucified, or they must perish for ever. The name of Jesus is given to men of every age and nation, as that whereby alone believers are saved from the wrath to come. But when covetousness, pride, or any corrupt passion, rules within, men shut their eyes, and close their hearts, in enmity against the light; considering all as ignorant and unlearned, who desire to know nothing in comparison with Christ crucified. And the followers of Christ should act so that all who converse with them, may take knowledge that they have been with Jesus. That makes them holy, heavenly, spiritual, and cheerful, and raises them above this world.</body></html>
