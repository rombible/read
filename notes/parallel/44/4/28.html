No such solution is indeed possible. If we admit a Divine Will at all, manifesting itself in the government of the world, in the education of man kind, in the salvation of individual souls, we must follow the example of the Apostle, and hold both the facts of which consciousness and experience bear their witness, without seeking for a logical formula of reconciliation. In every fact of history, no less than in the great fact of which St. Peter speaks, the will of each agent is free, and he stands or falls by the part he has taken in it; and yet the outcome of the whole works out some law of evolution, some "increasing purpose," which we recognise as we look back on the course of the events, the actors in which were impelled by their own base or noble aims, their self-interest or their self-devotion. As each man looks back on his own life he traces a sequence visiting him with a righteous retribution, and leading him, whether he obeyed the call, or resisted it, to a higher life, an education no less than a probation. "Man proposes, God disposes." "God works in us, therefore we must work." Aphorisms such as these are the nearest approximation we can make to a practical; though not a theoretical, solution of the great mystery.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - To do <span class="accented">for</span> for <span class="accented">to do</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">foreordained to come to pass</span> for <span class="accented">determined before to be done</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To do</span> (for the sentiment, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>). They were gathered together for the purpose of executing, their own will, as they thought, but really to fulfil the purpose of God (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26, 27</a>).

It encourages God's servants, both in doing work, and suffering work, that they serve the God who made all things, and therefore has the disposal of all events; and the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Jesus was anointed to be a Saviour, therefore it was determined he should be a sacrifice, to make atonement for sin. But sin is not the less evil for God's bringing good out of it. In threatening times, our care should not be so much that troubles may be prevented, as that we may go on with cheerfulness and courage in our work and duty. They do not pray, Lord let us go away from our work, now that it is become dangerous, but, Lord, give us thy grace to go on stedfastly in our work, and not to fear the face of man. Those who desire Divine aid and encouragement, may depend upon having them, and they ought to go forth, and go on, in the strength of the Lord God. God gave a sign of acceptance of their prayers. The place was shaken, that their faith might be established and unshaken. God gave them greater degrees of his Spirit; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than ever; by which they were not only encouraged, but enabled to speak the word of God with boldness. When they find the Lord God help them by his Spirit, they know they shall not be confounded, Isa 1.7.</body></html>
