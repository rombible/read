The disciples felt the power of the Spirit, the evidence of sense confirming that of inward, spiritual consciousness, and it came in the form for which they had made a special supplication, the power to speak with boldness the word which they were commissioned to speak.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> <span class="accented">- Wherein they were gathered</span> for <span class="accented">when they were assembled</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When they had prayed</span>.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is properly used of ships or of the sea agitated and tossed by the wind; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-7.htm">Matthew 11:7</a>, "A reed shaken by the wind." But it is also applied to the rocking caused by an earthquake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-26.htm">Acts 16:26</a>), which maybe the kind of shaking here meant. In this fresh outpouring or the Spirit, whereby they were enabled to <span class="cmt_word">speak the word of God with boldness</span>, they had a direct and immediate answer to their prayer (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:23-31 Christ's followers do best in company, provided it is their own company. It encourages God's servants, both in doing work, and suffering work, that they serve the God who made all things, and therefore has the disposal of all events; and the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Jesus was anointed to be a Saviour, therefore it was determined he should be a sacrifice, to make atonement for sin. But sin is not the less evil for God's bringing good out of it. In threatening times, our care should not be so much that troubles may be prevented, as that we may go on with cheerfulness and courage in our work and duty. They do not pray, Lord let us go away from our work, now that it is become dangerous, but, Lord, give us thy grace to go on stedfastly in our work, and not to fear the face of man. Those who desire Divine aid and encouragement, may depend upon having them, and they ought to go forth, and go on, in the strength of the Lord God. God gave a sign of acceptance of their prayers. The place was shaken, that their faith might be established and unshaken. God gave them greater degrees of his Spirit; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than ever; by which they were not only encouraged, but enabled to speak the word of God with boldness. When they find the Lord God help them by his Spirit, they know they shall not be confounded, Isa 1.7.</body></html>
