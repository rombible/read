It is possible, as Rabbinic writers often give <span class= "ital">Jose</span> for Joseph, that both were but different forms, like Simon and Simeon, of the same name. The later friendship between the Levite of Cyprus and St. Paul makes it probable that there had been some previous companionship (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm" title="But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.">Acts 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm" title="Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:">Acts 11:25</a>), and it may well have been that he was sent from Cyprus to receive his education in the famous schools of Tarsus, or practised with Saul in early life the craft of tent-making, for which Tarsus was famous, and in which they were afterwards fellow-labourers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1Corinthians 9:6</a>). As a Levite he had probably taken his place in the ministries of the Temple, and may, therefore, have been among our Lord's actual hearers. His relation Mary, the mother of John surnamed Marcus, was, we know, living at Jerusalem. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>.) A tradition, as early as Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom. ii.</span> ? 116), makes him one of the Seventy, and this agrees with the prophetic character which we have seen reason to think of as attaching to that body. (See. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.) The new name which the Apostles gave him, literally, if we look to its Hebrew etymology, <span class= "ital">The son of prophecy, </span>or, taking St. Luke's translation, <span class= "ital">The son of counsel, </span>implies the possession of a special gift of persuasive utterance, in which the Apostles recognised the work of the Spirit. The Paraclete had endowed him with the gift of <span class= "ital">paraclesis, </span>in the sense in which that word included counsel, comfort, admonition, application of divine truth to the spiritual necessities of men. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus G. on St. John's Gospel.</span>) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm" title="Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would hold to the Lord.">Acts 11:23</a>, we find him <span class= "ital">exhorting</span> the Gentile converts at Antioch, the verb being that from which <span class= "ital">paraclesis</span> is derived. He was, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>conspicuous for the gift of prophecy as that gift is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm" title="But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.">1Corinthians 14:3</a>. The several stages in his life come before us later. An Epistle bearing his name, and recognised as his by Clement of Alexandria and Origen, is still extant, but its authenticity is, to say the least, questionable. It consists mainly of allegorical interpretations of Old Testament narratives. Some critics have assigned the Epistle to the Hebrews to his authorship, as the expounder of St. Paul's thoughts. It should be noted that a little further on his kinswoman Mary's house is the chief meeting-place of the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>), and that her son John, surnamed Mark, is mentioned by St. Peter ("Marcus my son," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>) in words which make it almost certain that he was converted by that Apostle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> <span class="accented">- Joseph</span> for <span class="accented">Joses</span>, A.V., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>; <span class="accented">Son of exhortation</span> for <span class="accented">The son of consolation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of Cyprus by race</span> for <span class="accented">and of the country of Cyprus</span>, A.V. Joseph. In the variation of manuscripts it is difficult to say which is right. Some (Grotius, Alford, etc.) consider the two forms as mere variations in writing the name <span class="accented">Joseph.</span> But it seems more probable that <span class="accented">Joses</span> is the same name as <span class="accented">Josiah</span>, only without the addition of the Divine Name (Jab) at the end (see Simon, 'Onomast.'). It is found as a proper name in the T.R. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40, 47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-29.htm">Luke 3:29</a> (Jose); and is not likely to have been substituted for the common name of Joseph. The Codex Sinaiticus has <span class="accented">Joses</span> only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>. The R.V. has <span class="accented">Joseph</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>, and <span class="accented">Joses</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40, 47</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-29.htm">Luke 3:29</a> the R.V. has <span class="accented">Jesus.</span> But <span class="accented">Joses</span> is probably right both here and in the above-cited passages. <span class="cmt_word">Barnabas</span>; literally, <span class="accented">son of prophecy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a prophet, as he is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a>. Probably his exhortations under the influence of the Holy Spirit in the Church assemblies were particularly stirring and edifying. The Greek version of the name, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, should be rendered, as in R.V., <span class="cmt_word">Son of exhortation</span>, for "son of consolation? is a meaning which can hardly be got out of the Hebrew. The apostles seem here to have followed our Lord's example in naming the sons of Zebedee, sons of thunder. <span class="cmt_word">A man of Cyprus by race</span>. The A.V. is less accurate, but it gives the sense better. Cyprus was the country where he was born and lived, as, it is likely, his fathers had done before him. But he was hardly, in our sense of the words, a Cypriot by race. We know that a great many Jews were settled in Cyprus (Philo, 'Leg. ad Caium.,'&sect; 36; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:4; Alford, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); and we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a> that in Salamis alone there were several synagogues. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:32-37 The disciples loved one another. This was the blessed fruit of Christ's dying precept to his disciples, and his dying prayer for them. Thus it was then, and it will be so again, when the Spirit shall be poured upon us from on high. The doctrine preached was the resurrection of Christ; a matter of fact, which being duly explained, was a summary of all the duties, privileges, and comforts of Christians. There were evident fruits of Christ's grace in all they said and did. They were dead to this world. This was a great evidence of the grace of God in them. They did not take away others' property, but they were indifferent to it. They did not call it their own; because they had, in affection, forsaken all for Christ, and were expecting to be stripped of all for cleaving to him. No marvel that they were of one heart and soul, when they sat so loose to the wealth of this world. In effect, they had all things common; for there was not any among them who lacked, care was taken for their supply. The money was laid at the apostles' feet. Great care ought to be taken in the distribution of public charity, that it be given to such as have need, such as are not able to procure a maintenance for themselves; those who are reduced to want for well-doing, and for the testimony of a good conscience, ought to be provided for. Here is one in particular mentioned, remarkable for this generous charity; it was Barnabas. As one designed to be a preacher of the gospel, he disentangled himself from the affairs of this life. When such dispositions prevail, and are exercised according to the circumstances of the times, the testimony will have very great power upon others.</body></html>
