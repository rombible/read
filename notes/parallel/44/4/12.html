The Greek has the article before "salvation." That of which Peter spoke was <span class= "ital">the</span> salvation which the rulers professed to be looking for.<p><span class= "bld">Given among men.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that has been given.</span> The words must be taken in the sense which Peter had learnt to attach to the thought of the Name as the symbol of personality and power. To those to whom it had been made known, and who had taken in all that it embodied, the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth was the one true source of deliverance and salvation. Speaking for himself and the rulers, Peter rightly says that it is the Name "whereby <span class= "ital">we</span> must be saved." Where it is not so known, it rises to its higher significance as the symbol of a divine energy; and so we may rightly say that the heathen who obtain salvation are saved by the Name of the Lord of whom they have never heard. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-13.htm" title="Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.">1Timothy 4:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- And in none other is there salvation</span> for <span class="accented">neither is there salvation in any other</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">neither is there any other</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">there is none other</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that is given</span> for <span class="accented">given</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">wherein</span> for whereby, A.V. The eighteenth Article of Religion refers directly to this verse as proving that eternal salvation can be obtained only by the Name of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:5-14 Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost, would have all to understand, that the miracle had been wrought by the name, or power, of Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, whom they had crucified; and this confirmed their testimony to his resurrection from the dead, which proved him to be the Messiah. These rulers must either be saved by that Jesus whom they had crucified, or they must perish for ever. The name of Jesus is given to men of every age and nation, as that whereby alone believers are saved from the wrath to come. But when covetousness, pride, or any corrupt passion, rules within, men shut their eyes, and close their hearts, in enmity against the light; considering all as ignorant and unlearned, who desire to know nothing in comparison with Christ crucified. And the followers of Christ should act so that all who converse with them, may take knowledge that they have been with Jesus. That makes them holy, heavenly, spiritual, and cheerful, and raises them above this world.</body></html>
