A rumour would spread through the city that the company of strangers, who had been objects of curiosity and suspicion, were engaged in a conspiracy against the worship which was the pride and glory of their city. It was natural, in such circumstances, that they should flock together to the largest place of public concourse, and drag thither any of that company on whom they might chance to light. We may compare, as an interesting historical parallel, the excitement which was caused at Athens by the mutilation of the Hermae-busts at the time of the Sicilian Expedition under Alcibiades (Thuc. vi. 27).<p><span class= "bld">Gaius and Aristarchus.</span>--The former name represents the Roman "Caius." It was one of the commonest of Latin names, and appears as belonging to four persons in the New Testament: (1) the Macedonian mentioned here; (2) Gaius of Derbe (but see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>); (3) Gaius of Corinth, the host of St. Paul, whom he baptised with his own hands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;">1Corinthians 1:14</a>); (4) Gaius to whom St. John addressed his third Epistle; (3) and (4), however, may probably be the same. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to the Third Epistle General of John.</span>) Of Aristarchus we learn, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>, that he was of Thessalonica. As such he had probably had some previous experience of such violence, and had, we may believe, shown courage in resisting it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1Thessalonians 2:14</a>). He appears as one of St. Paul's companions in the journey to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), probably as a delegate from the Macedonian churches. He appears, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>, to have been a Jewish convert, and to have shared the Apostle's imprisonment at Rome, either as himself under arrest, or, more probably, as voluntarily accepting confinement in the Apostle's hired house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-30.htm" title="And Paul dwelled two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in to him,">Acts 28:30</a>), that he might minister to his necessities. The description given of them, as "Paul's companions in travel" is not without significance as implying a missionary activity beyond the walls of Ephesus, in which they had been sharers.<p><span class= "bld">They rushed with one accord into the theatre.</span>--The theatre of Ephesus was, next to the Temple of Artemis, its chief glory. Mr. Wood, the most recent explorer, describes it as capable of holding twenty-five thousand people (<span class= "ital">Ephes.</span> p. 68). It was constructed chiefly for gladiatorial combats with wild beasts and the like, but was also used for dramatic entertainments. The theatre of a Greek city, with its wide open area, was a favourite spot for public meetings of all kinds, just as Hyde Park is with us, or as the Champ de Mars was in the French Revolution. So Vespasian addressed the people in the theatre of Antioch (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Hist. ii.</span> 80; comp. also Apuleius, <span class= "ital">Metamorph., </span>bk. iii.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - The <span class="accented">city</span> for <span class="accented">the whole city</span>, and <span class="accented">the confusion</span> for <span class="accented">confusion</span>, A.V. and T.R.

The common place of resort for all great meetings. So Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 2:80 (quoted by Alford), says that at Antioch the people were wont to hold their public debates in the theatre, and that a crowded meeting was held there to forward the interests of Vespasian, then aspiring to the empire. So Josephus speaks of the people of Antioch holding a public assembly (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in the theatre ('Bell. Jud.,' 7. 3:3). The people of the Greek city of Tarentum received the ambassadors from Rome in the theatre, "according to the Greek custom," Val. Max., 2:2, 5 (Kuinoel, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>). The theatre at Ephesus, of which "ruins of immense grandeur" still remain, is said to be the largest of which we have any account (Howson, 2. p. 68). <span class="cmt_word">Having seized</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); a favorite word with Luke(<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-29.htm">Luke 8:29</a>); and found also in the LXX, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>; 2 Macc. 3:27 2Macc. 4:41; but not elsewhere in the New Testament. It is a common medical word of sudden seizures. The force of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> is that they hurried Gaius and Aristarchus along with them to the theatre, no doubt intending there to accuse them to the people. <span class="cmt_word">Gaius and Aristarchus</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> there is mention of a certain <span class="accented">Gains</span> who was one of Paul's companions in travel, but who is described as "of Derbe." Again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14</a> a Gains is mentioned as one of St. Paul's converts on his first visit to Corinth, whom he baptized himself; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a> (written from Corinth) we have mention of Gains as St. Paul's host, and of the whole Church, likely, therefore, to be the same person. Then we have the Gains to whom St. John's Third Epistle is addressed, and whose hospitality to the brethren was a conspicuous feature in his character, and one tending to identify him with the Gaius of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>. We seem, therefore, to have, in immediate connection with St, Paul, Gaius of Corinth, Gains of Macedonia, and Gains of Derbe. But Gaius (or Caius, as it is written in Latin) was such a common name, and the Jews so often shifted their residence from one city to another, that it is not safe either to infer identity from identity of name, or diversity from diversity of description. <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span>, here described as of <span class="cmt_word">Macedonia</span>, is more precisely spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> as a Thessalonian. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>, where we find him accompanying St. Paul from Caesarea to Rome, he is described as "a Macedonian of Thessalonica." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a> he is St. Paul's "fellow-prisoner,' as voluntarily sharing his prison (Alford, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> he is his fellow-laborer. His history, therefore, is that, having been converted on St Paul's visit to Thessalonica, he attached himself to him as one of his missionary staff, and continued with him through good report and evil report, through persecution, violence, imprisonment, shipwreck, and bonds, to the latest moment on which the light of Bible history shines. Blessed servant of Christ! blessed fellow-servant of his chief apostle! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:21-31 Persons who came from afar to pay their devotions at the temple of Ephesus, bought little silver shrines, or models of the temple, to carry home with them. See how craftsmen make advantage to themselves of people's superstition, and serve their worldly ends by it. Men are jealous for that by which they get their wealth; and many set themselves against the gospel of Christ, because it calls men from all unlawful crafts, however much wealth is to be gotten by them. There are persons who will stickle for what is most grossly absurd, unreasonable, and false; as this, that those are gods which are made with hands, if it has but worldly interest on its side. The whole city was full of confusion, the common and natural effect of zeal for false religion. Zeal for the honour of Christ, and love to the brethren, encourage zealous believers to venture into danger. Friends will often be raised up among those who are strangers to true religion, but have observed the honest and consistent behaviour of Christians.</body></html>
