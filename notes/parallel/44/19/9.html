Originally meaning "leisure," it was applied to leisure as bestowed on study, then, as here, to the place in which study was pursued; lastly, as in our phrase, "the school of Zeno or Epicurus," as a collective term for the followers of a conspicuous teacher. In this case, it was probably a lecture-room which, as the private property of the owner, was lent or let to the Apostle.<p>Of the Tyrannus here mentioned nothing more is known with certainty, but the name is connected with one or two interesting coincidences that are more or less suggestive. Like its Latin equivalent, R<span class= "ital">ex</span> it was not uncommon among the class of slaves or freed-men. It is found in the <span class= "ital">Columbarium</span> of the household of Livia on the Appian Way, and as belonging to one who is described as a <span class= "ital">Medicus</span> or physician. Both names and professions in this class were very commonly hereditary, and the hypothesis that this Tyrannus was also a physician, and that, as such, he may have known St. Luke, or, possibly, may have been among the Jews whom the decree of Claudius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>) had driven from Rome, and so shared the faith of Aquila and Priscilla, fits in with and explains the facts recorded. An unconverted teacher of philosophy or rhetoric was not likely to have lent his class-room to a preacher of the new faith. (See also Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Some</span> for <span class="accented">divers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">disobedient</span> for <span class="accented">believed not</span>, A.V.

"<span class="accented">Beth-midrash - The</span> Jewish divinity school, where their doctors disputed of the more high and difficult matters of the Law" (Index to Lightfoot's Works).

The name Tyrannus occurs in 2 Macc. 4:40; Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 16. 10:4; 'Bell Jud.,' 1. 26:6, of an officer in Herod's bodyguard, who might be a Jew or a Greek; and a certain <span class="accented">Tyrannus</span> is described by Suidas as a sophist and an author, possibly the same as is here spoken cf. Lightfoot, Meyer, Alford, and others think that the Tyrannus here spoken of was a Jew; Lange, Olshausen, Howson, Farrar, Lewin, etc., think he was a Greek philosopher or rhetorician. Some think that "the school of Tyrannus" was the name of the lecture-room from some former teacher (see Renan. p. 345). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:8-12 When arguments and persuasions only harden men in unbelief and blasphemy, we must separate ourselves and others from such unholy company.
