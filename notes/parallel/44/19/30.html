He refers probably to this when he speaks of having, as far as man was concerned, "fought with beasts at Ephesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm" title="If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.">1Corinthians 15:32</a>); not that there was any actual danger of martyrdom in that form, but that the multitude in their fanatic rage presented as formidable an ordeal. So Ignatius (Ep. <span class= "ital">ad Rom. </span>c. 3) speaks of himself as "fighting with wild beasts" (using the same word as St. Paul), and describes the soldiers who kept guard over him in his journey from Antioch to Rome as the "ten leopards" who were his companions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="accented">- Was minded to enter</span> for <span class="accented">would have entered</span>, A.V. With the courage of a pure conscience, conscious of no wrong, and therefore fearing no wrong, Paul would have gone straight to the theatre, and cast in his lot with Gaius and Aristarchus; but the disciples, knowing the savage temper of the multitude, dissuaded him; and when their entreaties were backed by the magistrates, Paul thought it his duty to yield. <span class="cmt_word">To enter in unto the people</span>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> are phrases implying the intention of pleading his cause before them (see Schleusner and Kuinoel, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-30.htm">Acts 19:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:21-31 Persons who came from afar to pay their devotions at the temple of Ephesus, bought little silver shrines, or models of the temple, to carry home with them. See how craftsmen make advantage to themselves of people's superstition, and serve their worldly ends by it. Men are jealous for that by which they get their wealth; and many set themselves against the gospel of Christ, because it calls men from all unlawful crafts, however much wealth is to be gotten by them. There are persons who will stickle for what is most grossly absurd, unreasonable, and false; as this, that those are gods which are made with hands, if it has but worldly interest on its side. The whole city was full of confusion, the common and natural effect of zeal for false religion. Zeal for the honour of Christ, and love to the brethren, encourage zealous believers to venture into danger. Friends will often be raised up among those who are strangers to true religion, but have observed the honest and consistent behaviour of Christians.</body></html>
