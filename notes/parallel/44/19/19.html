These arts were almost, so to speak, the <span class= "ital">specialite</span> of Ephesus. Magicians and astrologers swarmed in her streets (comp. the reference to them as analogous to the magicians at the court of Pharaoh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.">2Timothy 3:8</a>), and there was a brisk trade in the charms, incantations, books of divination, rules for interpreting dreams, and the like, such as have at all times made up the structure of superstition. The so-called "Ephesian spells" (<span class= "ital">grammata Ephesia</span>) were small slips of parchment in silk bags, on which were written strange cabalistical words, of little or of lost meaning. The words themselves are given by Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom.</span> v., c. 46), and he interprets them, though they are so obscure as to baffle the conjectures of philology, as meaning Darkness and Light, the Earth and the Year, the Sun and Truth. They were probably a survival of the old Phrygian <span class= "ital">cultus</span> of the powers of Nature which had existed prior to the introduction of the Greek name of Artemis.<p><span class= "bld">And burned them before all men.</span>--This, then, was the result of the two sets of facts recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-16.htm" title="And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.">Acts 19:16</a>. The deep-ingrained superstition of the people was treated, as it were, hom?opathically. Charms and names were allowed to be channels of renovation, but were shown to be so by no virtue of their own, but only as being <span class= "ital">media</span> between the Divine power on the one hand and the faith of the receiver on the other; and so the disease was cured. The student of the history of Florence cannot help recalling the analogous scene in that city, when men and women, artists and musicians, brought the things in which they most delighted--pictures, ornaments, costly dresses--and burnt them in the Piazza of St. Mark at the bidding of Savonarola. The tense of the verb implies that the "burning" was continuous, but leaves it uncertain whether it was an oft-repeated act or one that lasted for some hours. In this complete renunciation of the old evil past we may probably see the secret of the capacity for a higher knowledge which St. Paul recognises as belonging to Ephesus more than to most other churches. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span>--The coin referred to was the Attic <span class= "ital">drachma, </span>usually estimated at about 8�d. of English money, and the total amount answers, accordingly, to 1, 770 17s. 6d., as the equivalent in coin. In its purchasing power, as determined by the prevalent rate of wages (a <span class= "ital">denarius</span> or <span class= "ital">drachma</span> for a day's work), it was probably equivalent to a much larger sum. Such books fetched what might be called "fancy" prices, according to their supposed rareness, or the secrets to which they professed to introduce. Often, it may be, a book was sold as absolutely unique.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- And not a few</span> for <span class="accented">many</span>... <span class="accented">also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> practice<span class="accented">d</span> for <span class="accented">which used</span> A.V.; <span class="accented">in the sight of all</span> for <span class="accented">before all men</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">That practiced curious arts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> applied to persons means "a busybody" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-13.htm">1 Timothy 5:13</a>), one who does what it is not his business to do, and pries into matters with which he has no concern (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11</a>); applied to things, it means that which it is not anybody's business to attend to, that which is vain and superfluous; and then, by a further extension of meaning, that which is forbidden, and specially magic arts and occult sciences. <span class="cmt_word">Fifty thousand pieces of silver</span>. There is a difference of opinion as to what coin or weight is meant. If Greek coinage, which is perhaps natural in a Greek city, fifty thousand drachmae of silver would be meant, equal to &pound;1875, If Jewish shekels are meant, the sum would amount to &pound;7000 ('Speaker's Commentary'). It is in favor of drachmae being meant that, with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-2.htm">Judges 17:2</a>, the LXX. always express the word "shekel" or "didrachm" after the numeral and before the word "silver." If St. Luke, therefore, had meant shekels, he would have written <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> But it was the Greek usage to omit the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> when the reckoning was by drachmae (Meyer). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:13-20 It was common, especially among the Jews, for persons to profess or to try to cast out evil spirits. If we resist the devil by faith in Christ, he will flee from us; but if we think to resist him by the using of Christ's name, or his works, as a spell or charm, Satan will prevail against us. Where there is true sorrow for sin, there will be free confession of sin to God in every prayer and to man whom we have offended, when the case requires it. Surely if the word of God prevailed among us, many lewd, infidel, and wicked books would be burned by their possessors. Will not these Ephesian converts rise up in judgement against professors, who traffic in such works for the sake of gain, or allow themselves to possess them? If we desire to be in earnest in the great work of salvation, every pursuit and enjoyment must be given up which hinders the effect of the gospel upon the mind, or loosens its hold upon the heart.</body></html>
