With regard to the great tumult to which the foregoing narrative relates, it is certain that St. Luke has by no means exaggerated its importance. In his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Macedonia shortly after his departure from Ephesus, St. Paul speaks as one still smarting under the severity of his sufferings. In the language of trust, yet of a trust sorely tried, he speaks of the Father of mercies" who comforteth us in all our tribulation." He speaks of the sufferings of Christ as abounding in him. And then, referring directly to the trouble which came upon him in Asia, he <span class="accented">says</span>, "We were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4-10</a>). And the same tone breaks out again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>. It is also very probable that it was on this occasion that Priscilla and Aquila saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own, to which he alludes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4</a>, written after he had reached Corinth from Macedonia, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before Easter of the year So that it is certain that the riot and the danger to St. Paul's life were even greater than we should have inferred from St. Luke's narrative alone. It should be added, with reference to the three <span class="accented">years</span> residence at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>) which this nineteenth chapter describes, that one or two important incidents which occurred are not related by St. Luke. The first is that encounter with a savage rabble to which St. Paul refers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>, but of which we have no account in the Acts. It must have happened in the early part of his sojourn at Ephesus. Another is a probable visit to Corinth, inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1, 2</a>; and thought to have been caused by bad accounts of the moral state of the Corinthian Church, sent to him at Ephesus. It was probably a hasty visit, and in contrast with it he says, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>, with reference to his then coming visit, "I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you." It is also thought that there was another letter to the Corinthians, written from Ephesus, soon after that second visit, which is now lost, but is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>. The First Epistle to the Corinthians was manifestly written at this time from Ephesus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8, 19</a>). Some think that the Epistle to the Galatians was also written from Ephesus, a little before the First Epistle to the Corinthians (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>); but Renan thinks it was written from Antioch, before he came to Ephesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:32-41 The Jews came forward in this tumult. Those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the great day. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a very good rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to be hasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and always to keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent at leisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop popular tumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand in awe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well it were if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, by considering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven and earth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the public peace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring each other. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetrius and the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with men enraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that all arguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by the practices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, or whatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should be discountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not be dismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; he can still the rage of the people.</body></html>
