Demetrius and his followers were to lodge a formal statement of the charge they brought against the accused. They in their turn were to put in a rejoinder, and so joining issue, each side would produce its witnesses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- If therefore</span> for <span class="accented">wherefore if</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the courts are</span> for <span class="accented">the law is</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proconsuls</span> for <span class="accented">deputies</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">accuse</span> for <span class="accented">implead</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Against any man</span>. Mark the skill with which the town-clerk passes from the concrete to the abstract, and avoids the mention of Paul's name. <span class="cmt_word">The courts are open</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Some supply the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and make the sense "judicial assemblies," "sessions," coming round at proper fixed intervals. But the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, more naturally suggests <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as Bengel says (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, etc.), and then the meaning is, "<span class="accented">The</span> regular court-days are kept, when the proconsul attends to try causes;" there is no need to have an irregular trial. So Suidas explains it, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">There are proconsuls</span>. Bengel, with whom Meyer agrees, thinks the plural denotes the unbroken succession of proconsuls. But Lewin thinks it may mark the exact time of these transactions as being immediately after the poisoning of the Proconsul Junius Silanus by order of Agrippina, when the two procurators, Celer and AElius, exercised the proconsular power till the appointment of another proconsul, according to a law of Claudius to that effect. Others have other explanations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:32-41 The Jews came forward in this tumult. Those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the great day. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a very good rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to be hasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and always to keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent at leisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop popular tumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand in awe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well it were if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, by considering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven and earth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the public peace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring each other. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetrius and the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with men enraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that all arguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by the practices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, or whatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should be discountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not be dismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; he can still the rage of the people.</body></html>
