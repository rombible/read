They would speak, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>of the "church" of Diana, or the "chapel" of Apollo. The corresponding noun for "robbing temples," or "sacrilege," is found in inscriptions discovered by Mr. Wood (vi. 1, p. 14) among the ruins of the Temple, as denoting a crime to which the severest penalties were attached. The testimony to the general character of St. Paul and his companions, as shown both in word and deed, indicates the quietness and calmness with which they had preached the truth. They persuaded, but they did not ridicule or revile. This was, probably, more than could be said for Alexander and the Jews who put him forward. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> <span class="accented">- Temples</span> for <span class="accented">churches</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">,or</span> for <span class="accented">nor yet</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">our</span> for <span class="accented">your</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have brought</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is especially used of "bringing before a magistrate," "leading to execution," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-12.htm">Luke 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-1.htm">Luke 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-19.htm">Acts 17:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Robbers of temples</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> found only here in the New Testament.

If the A.V. is right, perhaps we may see in the phrase "your goddess" an indication that the town-clerk himself was more or less persuaded by St. Paul's preaching, that "they are no gods which are made with hands," and did not care to speak of Diana as his own goddess. It appears also that St. Paul had not launched out into abuse of the heathen gods in general, or Diana in particular, but had preached the more excellent way by faith in Jesus Christ, to draw them from their idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:32-41 The Jews came forward in this tumult. Those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the great day. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a very good rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to be hasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and always to keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent at leisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop popular tumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand in awe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well it were if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, by considering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven and earth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the public peace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring each other. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetrius and the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with men enraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that all arguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by the practices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, or whatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should be discountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not be dismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; he can still the rage of the people.</body></html>
